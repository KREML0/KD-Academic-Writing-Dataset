1	2978	2	3	Certain materials being removed from libraries such as books, music and magazines, shouldn't be removed from the libraries. It gives people a chance to understand how the real world is. Having certain materials such as books and music definitely should not be removed, because most books and music can show most people how bad the statement in the book is or how bad the lyrics are in a song, and help that person to avoid that type of thing that the book or song is saying to the reader or listener. People should give every type of music at least a try and not always doubt what they hear about what people say about that type of music. I always hear about people saying how bad the band Shinedown is, just because in the lyrics it talks about drugs and how much cursing each song has. Really the band is talking about one mans life and how he turns his life from being a drug addict to having the best life someone could ever live. People always doubted him and never gave his music a chance. Another example would be Brandon Novak's book, 'Dreamseller' for it talks about drug addicts, homeless people, people who have been born with disfigured arms or even someone who lost there legs, and telling how beautiful each and everyone of them really are. His book taught me a few things and made me think different about people. It doesn't matter how they look or how they talk, no matter what, that person is beautiful. As far as movies and magazines has gone within the last few years, I think that they also shouldn't be taken from libraries. I think this for the same reason of how I feel about the books and music. Of course we see previews of movies and think that they might not be good, but libraries shouldn't keep leave them out. Movies are a great way to learn how to treat others and how to act around other people when you don't know how to act. If you act differently around people that you've never been around before, then you could feel embarrassed or maybe even get hurt. Movies can help people learn about the real world by seeing how to do those type of things as we get older. Same goes with the magazines, they also help people see what not to do or to help them understand the consequences of something that shouldn't be done. Knowing what to do from a magazine could possible save your life or perhaps maybe even someone elses life. I don't understand why some libraries would want to banned certain materials to help people understand the things that happen in someone elses life and to help them not make the same mistakes as that person once did, because such resources offer valuable learning opportunities and perspectives.
2	2979	2	3	To the Editor,  I am writing to express my views on censorship in libraries. I believe certain materials should be removed. There should be no person in charge of deciding what books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are available; that should not be argued. I think if you need that, please think I know. Thank you. Please, if I need why, do we, if know that if I failure this test, I need to graduate. Please allow the children to go home. Yes.  Why do we need to be a perfect person? Why do we need to do this? Why write this assignment? Because you mean to be the best teacher ever and ever. Facebook is my password is @PERSON1 @NUM1. That's why I need my Myspace is the same thing but different at the same time. Please know that I need to know. I really need to. My e-mail address is @EMAIL1. That is my e-mail; please work.  Ultimately, while the selection process requires careful consideration, imposing restrictions based on individual preferences is not the correct approach, and a more democratic system should be used instead.

I have read and seen a lot of books in my lifetime. I hear people telling me, ""oh don't read that book, it's a bad book."" But I ask myself, do I know it's a bad book when I haven't even given it a chance? Are some books, music, movies, and magazines out there that are offensive? Yet we still want to read, listen, watch, and look at them. If we tried to remove all the offensive books from the libraries, we wouldn't have anything left on the shelves. Katherine Paterson said, ""If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" Katherine Paterson makes a great point out of her quote, highlighting the slippery slope of censorship. Why should we have to remove a book if just some people think it's offensive? Ask yourself the question again, do you know it's a bad book when you haven't even given it a chance? Don't judge a book by what you hear; form your own opinion. Ultimately, restricting access based on subjective offense can lead to the removal of diverse perspectives and limit intellectual exploration, leaving shelves bare and minds uninformed."
4	2981	2	3	In @DATE1's world, there are many things found offensive. Everyone has their own opinion on what is offensive and what is not. Many parents are becoming upset because they think their children are viewing things that they should not. Other people are upset because they think the libraries are offending their culture or way of life. This is even taken to the extreme where people want censorship on libraries to avoid this, which is wrong. Some people are becoming concerned about the materials in libraries. They find these things to be offensive. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but there really is nothing anyone can do if someone is offended. The world is a public place and everywhere we go, something might be found offensive. The library is a place for study. It is never intended to offend someone, or bring bad to the world. It is simply a place to inform, and if someone is offended by what they see, they should stay away from the library. I have been to the library many times, none of which have I ever seen anything offensive. Everything I have ever witnessed at the library is for learning and research. There are certain sections in the library. If a parent does not want their child seeing something, they should keep their child in the children's section. I can assure you, there is nothing offensive in the children's section, or else the library would not have it in that section. The owners of these libraries know what is going to upset people and what will not. If there was truly offensive materials in the library, those materials would be taken out. Also, if a person complains, and the materials are removed, it could lessen someone else's chance getting the materials they need. One person could think the material is offensive, but someone else might want to learn more about it. If one is offended by a certain material, all they simply must do, is not look at it. The library can be compared to a big computer. One can basically find anything there. Asking the library to censor their materials is like asking the internet to censor theirs. It is a way of learning and researching and it would be almost impossible to censor everything there. Everyone is going to be offended some point in their life. If the libraries removed everything that could offend someone, they would have no materials left. People need to stop being so easily offended and realize the library is not trying to harm anyone. There does not need to be any censorship in libraries. It is simply trying to teach people about the world and let them enjoy books, music, movies, or whatever else one might go to the library to find, and this access to information should be protected without succumbing to censorship.
5	2982	2	3	"In life you have the 'offensive things', the little stuff that gets under our skin and eats away at us. It is not easy to get over, but these things will make you stronger. Sometimes books, magazines, music, and movies offend us. The only reason we get offended is because the subject either reflects our personality or our life. It's not the authors fault; they write what they feel and what is the truth. Libraries are full of books, movies, music, etc. You can't just take books off the shelves just because they offend you. Other people might like the book you hate, and there are more books in the library you can read.  Another reason people shouldn't remove offensive material from the library is that it will hurt the publishing company and the writers. Writers and publishers would lose so much money because the library sells their books, magazines, and movies. They make thousands of copies of their product, which costs money, and they sell to thousands of bookstores to make their money back.  Much of the offensive material will open the world's eyes. Everybody needs to see what's going on in the world. Books and newspapers tell the truth about a subject. The writer's intent isn't to hurt you but to help you. Why can't the world be more open?  I know in my own life I have read books that at first offended me. I would get so mad, I would put the book down and walk away. But then, my eyes would open and finally it hit me. The offensive part of the book helped me realize a new understanding. The views I used to have would be gone. It is strange how you finally open up, and your life changes.  Some people might even find this paper offensive. But if nobody is stepping on your toes and getting under your skin, you won't ever change. ""Offended"" is a word used lightly; yes, people use it a lot, but do they really mean it? Some people need to use 'well, this book bugs me'. Stop being about yourselves and get over it. Life is too short to worry and feel offended.  Every single book, magazine, movie, and piece of music needs to be left alone. Those materials reflect other people's lives and help others with theirs'. Just read another book or watch a different movie. Please do not remove anything from the shelves, because it will only do more damage, preventing others from having the chance to learn and grow."
6	2983	2	3	A lot of books, music, movies, and magazines are censored today because of their content. I think that it all can be fixed if you have certain age limits, separate sections, and my views on the censorship of books, music, movies, and magazines. Here's my idea to fix the problem. I understand that books and other material each month offend certain people, but it might not offend others. Thats why I think books, music, movies, and magazines should have a room for things that might offend certain people. The sign should say what content it has so the people can stay away from the room. There could be seperate rooms for children. It has nothing but children's books, movies, music, and magazines. Its a great idea because your child would'nt be open to the bad content. This brings me to my next topic. You must be a certain age to enter the 'bad content' room. I dont think the library staff or their parents want a five-year old boy checking out a book that deals with sex, drugs, and alcohol. The library could get in a lot of trouble. The age limit could be 18 years of age to enter the room. That seems fair enough. Your old enough to be able to handle the content. I dont get offended easily, so I can read just about anything. Like I suggested previously in the article, the bad content should be moved to a room so that people dont mistakenly come across it. I like reading about anything and everything, so I would love to read things and spark my attention. Books like that usually deal with bad things. I'm okay with that, but I understand that others are not. Seperate rooms, age limits, and my views are all good ideas. Maybe a library will come across my article and do what I have said. I think that will be very affective, and I hope to start seeing that in the future, as it would create a more balanced and respectful environment for everyone.
7	2984	2	3	How I would feel if my favorite book was taken off the shelves of my school or public library? I, along with many other students, find this discouraging and disastrous, so I do not believe that censorship should affect books that are on the shelves. Otherwise, a demolished love of reading, crushed individuality, and separated population will be born. Like the beloved Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, many books and series are being taken out of libraries' collections due to people in society finding them offensive. In this case, the world of witchcraft in which this story blooms is against some religious beliefs; therefore, some individuals within a religion campaign to have these books banned. Fortunately, none of the libraries I visit, with their eclectic collections, had banned this series, or I would not have the strong thirst for literature as I do now. All books have the potential to pull a student into the wonderful world of reading, like Harry Potter did for me, so taking away books that are most likely to spark an interest or start a firework of creativity would not only affect this generation, but the futures of all.  If this censorship was to be allowed, who is to say what all could be censored? Who would be the final judge as to what books would be banned? It would all come down to power and who was willing enough to take it. This struggle to be on top has the possibility of separating people apart like political parties. Disagreements could turn into debates, and those could turn into fights. It can be concluded that people are stubborn for their beliefs, and to have someone choose what everyone is allowed to believe would be wrong. For instance, it would be like an atheist forcing a Christian to not believe in God; a vegetarian commanding that meat can no longer be eaten; a woman taking away men's voting rights. Censorship could lead to the disrespect of other's opinions, and disrespect is never a beneficial thing.  Each and every person has a different opinion on what is offensive or not, so to censor books would be to censor all individual mentality. Without each person's unique thoughts and beliefs, the world would become similarly vapid and dull. Differences in beliefs is what adds variety to the population and what makes a person special; additionally, free thought is a right all people should have. If someone was to limit the mental, literary stimulants that are out in the world, the amount of creativity and individuality would decrease.  To conclude, censorship would be a disrespect to individuality, personal beliefs, and the overall joy of reading a good book. Just because one might not believe in what a story says, it does not mean that the piece of literature should be forbidden. No one is being forced to read the books that grace the hundreds of shelves in a library, so if someone is offended, simply do not read it. So how would you feel if your favorite book was gone from all libraries? Disrespected? That is how I would feel, and it is a feeling I hope no one has to experience due to unnecessary censorship.
8	2985	2	3	Do you think that you should be able to take certain materials off a shelf of a library, because someone finds it offensive? Here are some of the examples that I can think of just off of the top of my head. Books, movies, music, magazines, or even computer access. So if you wouldn't mind sit back get relaxed in a good comfortable spot, because here we go. So have you decided what you think about taking them off the shelf of your local library or even your school library. Well I have came up with what I think about it. In some way yes, but in other ways no. For an example I bet there are old books in my school library right know that haven't even been picked up for a long time, just because they are old and overly out dated. The reason I say they shouldn't be pulled off the shelf of a library. Well just because some people seems that it's offensive, doesn't mean it couldn't almost the most popular book in the hole library. The person that likes that book might find that the people that found the book offensive, they book might be offending the other person. So if you think about it, you will always have the people that like to complain about something no where you go. I just put an example out there of what I have seen. I was at a library one time and there way these to guys. One was complaining how the farm books never get messed with. Then the other guy walked up with two of the books that was over there in the farm section of that library. So the librarian is just taking in all the information that the two guys was disputing during that time. During all of this I was just about five feet form the counter these guys was at. So then the guy that was talk about how the farm books should get pulled off the shelf he ask the librarian where the books was on spaceships. Then the guy that was getting the farm books said you really should take them off the shelf because he hasn't seen anyone over that way for years. So that is just to tell you that if you was to take a book, some music, or any other of the thinks that you can find in a library should just more in likely stay where they are, because the library got them books or any of that other stuff for a reason. That reason is, because you don't ever know what someone might just come walking through that door just looking for that lonely book, magazine, movie, or just need to get on the computer. Well know that you probably getting tired of hearing the reasons why I think no books or any other things should get pulled off the shelf. Now it's time to tells you why they should get pulled off the shelf of that local library in your neighborhood. The main reason somethings should get pulled off the shelf of the local library or school library is if the book was really damaged. For an example I have been to one of the libraries in my county and they had a book in there that the back cover of the book was torn completely off. That is bad that they would have that on there shelf, just because that makes there library looks like a trashed up place to go to. Another reason why something should get pulled off the shelf is if the book supported drugs. Like if there was a books about some that was doing drug and they got caught with them and they just got a 'slap on the wrist' as I call it. A slap on the wrist is when you get in trouble for something and you don't even get in any trouble you just get handed over to your parents. That is what I think the saying 'just a slap on the wrist' means. So all in all more in likely the book should probably just stay on the shelf. Like I said earlier in this essay, you will always have you people that like to complain about every little pitty thing they can find to complain about. Which I mostly learned that from the state tractor pulling club. So I hope that I haven't taken to much of your time up. So just think next time you are at a library and you see a book and you think man that book needed to be taken off the shelfs, just refer back to this essay, and remember that censorship is a slippery slope, and that libraries are meant to be places of diverse thought.
9	2986	2	3	The idea of the removal of 'offensive' material from libraries is understandable. Some believe that this material is not appropriate for anyone to view. However, because we all have different opinions on what is offensive, I believe that books found to be offensive should not be removed from the shelves of the library. First, I believe that if this policy were to be in effect in libraries, there would not be many books left on the shelf. Offensive is a relative word. What might be offensive to one person might not be to another. Everyone has a different opinion on different matters based on their beliefs and life experiences. Many books have things people disagree with, but expressing this is a part of freedom of speech. Therefore, if everyone complained that they found a certain book or movie to be offensive, there would hardly be anything left, as Katherine Paterson said in relation to censorship. The purpose of a library is to provide the people who go to the library a resource. If the sources were censored in such a way, it would be hard to get information. Sometimes, it is beneficial, even, to read an opposing view or side to have more knowledge on a certain topic and see things from a different perspective. However, some books might not be entirely appropriate to certain people. For example, some material in the library might not be best for small children to read or view. In this case, I do not necessarily feel that they should be removed from the shelves rather than placed in an area these children do not have access to. Having books, music, movies, or magazines removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive is in my opinion, a ridiculous notion, a form of censorship that hinders expression. People have different opinions about what is offensive to them and it would be very boring if everyone thought the same. If someone finds something particularly offensive, I believe they just should not view it, allowing others to make their own informed choices.
10	2987	2	3	All authors write for a purpose, whether it be to teach, entertain, or persuade an audience. No author writes something and says, 'I hope no one picks this off of the shelf!' So, if every author wants to express something through their writing, then why should we not let them be heard. We all have the freedom of speech, right? So, why not the freedom of writing? Libraries should not remove a book, music, movie, or magazine from the shelf just because they found it offensive. Everyone will read a book that they don't like, its natural, but that doesn't mean that no one will like it. Authors write for an audience, but maybe you are not in that audience; so, it doesn't appeal to you and might even seem offensive. Not everyone believes in the same ideas. You could think about an issue one way and your neighbor think about it a totally different way. Like for instance, you're reading a book about a young girl that is going through many problems in her life. She has gotten into some really horrible situations. Some of these situations you read about are so awful that you wouldn't want anyone else to read it. But, did you ever think that maybe there's another girl that is or has gone through some of these same situations. Maybe this girl comes to a library and finds this book; suddenly she finds guidence in it. She finds something she can depend on in her life that she's never had before. She feels like she has a friend in this book that can handle the situations with her. So, would you really want to take that book off of the shelf and not let that girl ever find her guidence? Consider the impact on other individuals who might benefit from the material.  Situations happen like this all of the time. People find something special in what they read that other people might not find. When a librarian takes a book off of that shelf, an opportunity is forever gone. No one will ever be able to learn of what was to become of that writing and of those ideas. We all have a right to learn, to explore new ideas, and to expand our minds. No one should have the right to take that away, because doing so is infringing on the rights of readers and suppressing the potential impact of an author's work.
11	2988	2	3	I have noticed that some movies are affensive to other people. Like for an example, the superhero movies, books is about superheroes and some people don't believe in them or they don't like the movie so I do kind of see no point of making a movie that is about someone that is not real. However, some movies are okay for some people and their age. The movies that are rated 'R' are for the people who shouldn't be watching it yet like kids under the age. Magazines though do have some type of thing that I think that is affensive to other people. Like, I don't remember the name of them but they would have sections that would talk bad about another person like one of the kids would talk about the president or something like that. So I think some magazines should be removed off the shelves. The books however, I don't see a reason why to have them removed off the shelves. I don't think the books seem to be affensive as much as graphical. There could be some books out there that might be affensive to people though, like the ones that talk about a family that has no money or talk bad about them. For an example, you would be able to find a book and read it and find out that it is talking bout things that you don't want to know yet or want to know. So as you can see I have made an opinion on what they should do either keep the books, magazines, or movies off the shelf. But then I do see it the other way to, as some of us do like those kind of movies or book or even magazines and think that is very cool or interesting, so ultimately, there's a balance to strike between personal preference and potential offense.
12	2989	2	3	Personally I don't think libraries, movie stores, etc., should be selling any of the items just mentioned if they are found offensive to the public. I think it offends lots of people. Citizens such as senior citizens and children shouldn't have to be exposed to inappropriate material. I think in order to buy or rent certain books, music, movies, or magazines you should have to be at least eighteen years of age. The economy is bad enough the way it is. There is a new generation of people who are being raised at the moment, and they shouldn't have to look back at their childhood and have memories of seeing offensive movies, or reading offensive books and magazines. I think music is what influences a person the most. If they are constantly listening to foul language and what not, that is going to just stay into a person's mind. I know this from experience. I also believe that movies influence a person a lot too. For example, a kid goes to see a movie that has a lot of violence in it. Well after he is done watching the movie he thinks to himself, 'well it must be okay to kill someone because I saw someone kill another person because they got away with it and never got into trouble.' That is just one example of how the human mind can change. In conclusion I do believe that humans have the right to read, watch, or listen to what they want. I just think that people should have to be a certain age for some of the things though. Also, I think that anything citizens find offending should be hidden in some sort of area in a store or library, so that just people who want a certain item or whatever can get it without other people having to see or listen to anything offensive.
13	2990	2	3	A library is a place you can go to read, write, and relax. Nowadays, many people take for granted the knowledge that can be obtained there. Even more of the knowledge to be learned is being stripped away and cut down by censorship. Censorship can eliminate many varieties of reading materials that people can learn from and enjoy. First of all, removing classics from the shelves of libraries because they may offend certain people is completely unwarranted. If they offend you then do not read them. It is as simple as that. Many books offend people because they are not in agreement with their morals or beliefs. A great example of this is the @PERSON2 series. @PERSON2 @PERSON2 is a bestselling series with over a million copies that have been sold worldwide; however, it does not corrolate with many people's beliefs. Therefore those people boycott the series. I remember several years ago I attended a @PERSON2 @PERSON2 and the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 party at the local library to celebrate the next book in the series being released. While I was at the library there was a gigantic storm brewing. Now most people would think that it was only a storm, but the people in town who did not like the @PERSON2 books blamed it on the party. They said that we were worshipping the devil and @CAPS4 brought the storm to tell us that what we were doing was wrong. I know many people do not like the @PERSON2 series because there is witchcraft and wizardry in it, but that does not mean that they should blame natural occurences on a book! Even great novels like the @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 should not be banned because of their content. For a while, @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 was reading material for school, but then the 'morality police' banned it because it was about a crazy person. Books should not be required to meet everyone's personal standards. Consequently, what Katherine Paterson states is true. If we ban books because we do not agree with them or find them suitable, eventually there will not be any left to check out at the library. Although there could be a way to compromise. If the books with questionable content had a sticker on them telling the reader that, then it could benefit both sides. In conclusion, eliminating books is not a good idea because of how beneficial they are to us all, especially children. When I was young I would always want to be read to and when I continued to age I would always read. While I was in middle school every day I would have a book with me to read. Books allow the reader to travel to far off places or see what it would be like to walk in someone else's shoes. Books are a gateway to another world, so we must protect access to literature and avoid censorship that could stifle imagination and curtail opportunities for learning and growth, especially for young readers. Why take that magic away from children?
14	2991	2	3	Yes and no, some materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc, should be voted upon the citizens to be removed from shelves. I do think that some materials in those catagories should be removed if they are offensive to me as well as others, but it will take a long while to get them removed from stores and other places if other people like them. I do not like how they make some music to be very violent and cause minds of most teenagers to turn bad and start selling drugs on the street of their hometown, but i can't do anything about that because that kind of music is admired by those teenagers as well as some adults too. If some people can buckle down and see that stuff like that will mess up lives of teenagers and some adults who fall victim to it, then there is a chance that it can be stopped. Stopping things like this will save a community from disaster and cause other good chances in life for people in need for those chances. Here's another example, like this music artist named @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She has made some great songs for the past year and a half now. People have told me that she is part of a group called @CAPS3 and its a group where they try to I think 're-birth' thereselves. My friends wanted me to stop listening to her music. I told my friends that I do not like the fact that she joined this group, but that doesnt mean im gonna stop listen to her music. Now if she makes a song that is offensive to me and as well as my friends, then that where I draw the line. What im saying is that if people don't have others to back them up if something is highly offensive to them and oblivious to others, it will be very hard trying to prove yourself in the best way possible, highlighting the importance of collective agreement when aiming to remove content perceived as harmful or offensive.
15	2992	2	3	When talking about censorship in libraries, I don't think the people that work in the libraries should decide what goes on the shelves. The people of the community should have a say on what goes on the shelves, because they're the ones that are going to the library anyway. I believe that everybody is entitled to their own opinion, but I think certain materials should be removed. For example, some music could be offensive; therefore, I'm not saying that music shouldn't be totally removed from libraries. I'm saying the offensive music should be removed, to ensure the library remains a welcoming space for everyone.
16	2993	2	3	
17	2994	2	3	A lot of people that are in school have probably seen or heard of a book or magazine that had profanity or offended them. Some people think that kind of thing is funny, but to others it might bother them. Not only racial slurs can offend people, but profanity can make someone disappointed. Some parents do not want their child to hearing or saying things like that. And I believe if it is offensive it should be taken off the shelf in a library and you should too. The movies and music I think if it really offended somebody that they should have to either change the lyrics or get rid of it. They just should not offend somebody to be a good song or a really great movie. You can't not make something that is making fun of another race or a movie of killing them. Going to like school libraries, for books I think it really depends on the age group. Like their should not be anything that would be offensive or profanity in the elementary, middle, or high school libraries. They are just not old enough or mature to be seeing or reading those things in books or magazines. So if a student comes home with a book the class is reading and the parent doesn't like the content they should have the right to say that they don't want their child reading it. And if was really bad be able to take it out of the school. Even high school students that have more mature students get offended sometimes from the books their reading in school. One in example is 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. Even though it is a really good book and a lot of students read it. A lot of African Americans might get offended by all the racial slurs about African Americans. They just do not feel comfortable fellow students saying them and their teachers saying them. And the schools or libraries just should not make students read books that they don't feel comfortable reading. Or the libraries having books like that. Me in example, next year I'm going to have to read that book and I am just not going to like it. I'm half Black and I do not like people saying things like that. It is going to be a really akward moment for me. And I have some other friends that have read that book that didn't feel comfortable reading that book. Their are even little kid books that parents want out of their childs school library. The most challenged book in school libraries is Harry Potter. I know this because my librarian told me this one day. It is just a good book, but some parents don't want their kids reading about witchcraft and wizards. So they try to get them out of the library. And they should if the parents do't want their kids reading it. I just think if their is a certain amount of people complaining about a movie or song that their should not even be a fight about it. They should just get rid of it. Same thing in a school, if their is students or parents that are complaining and their is a certain amount of them, the librarian should not even have a say in it or the school. They should just get rid of the book or magazine. I believe that if it a book, song, movie , etc is offensive to a certain amount of people that it should just be taken care of by getting rid of it. Parents might not want their kids seeing, hearing, or reading that sort of stuff. And some people get offended by some books or movies. Or they just do't feel comfortable. I believe that things that are brought to the world for entertainment should also be able to get out of the world if people are offended by it, ensuring a more comfortable and respectful environment for everyone.
18	2995	2	3	I don't think that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves because someone finds them offensive. I simply do not find it right that a few people's opinions should matter depending on what they find offensive for two reasons: people picked the item out themselves, and they traveled to the library looking for something they would enjoy. The first reason I think that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelves is that people have picked them out themselves. No one is ever going to pick up a book or magazine or even watch movies and listen to music that looks, seems, or even sounds offensive, unless they are doing so intentionally. Most people don't take being offended kindly. For example, why would a person buy an object that does not seem appealing to them in the first place? The second reason that I think that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves is that if you're going to the library, you're looking for an interesting book, type of music, a movie, or a magazine. Most likely, you're going to end up getting one that looks interesting to you and something that you feel fits your taste. So if there is a book, some sort of music, a movie, or a magazine and it looks offensive, then don't get it. If something's going to offend you, it's going to be pretty obvious due to what it looks like, seems like, or even sounds like. In my opinion, if certain books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive to some people, they should not be taken off the shelf. If you picked something out at the library or went to the library looking for something that you would enjoy, you will obviously end up knowing if something looks, seems, or even sounds offensive, and you can simply choose not to engage with that material, allowing others to make their own informed choices.
19	2996	2	3	If the people that are publishing and writing these articles in these magazines then yes, they can feel offensive about the @CAPS7 things inside the magazine or books. These people are going to always find something or some rumor to start a big fight about these @CAPS1 things, those people are called '@CAPS2'. They can find A eazy way to get something started just like that, That's why before i buy A magazine, I take A look inside of first And see If @CAPS3 interested in buying that specific certain book, or magazine. If I don't like the things that I see inside of @CAPS5, then I @CAPS4 not buy @CAPS5, @CAPS5's @CAPS1 As that. If they are @CAPS7, they should immediately be removed from the news stands on the streets of @LOCATION1, @LOCATION6, @LOCATION12, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION5, @LOCATION8, @LOCATION9, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION10, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, Or @CAPS8 @LOCATION11, @LOCATION7. Therefore, controversial material should be carefully evaluated, and if deemed @CAPS7, swiftly removed from circulation in various locations, concluding that such action would mitigate potential offense.
20	2997	2	3	I think that all the bad books should be taken out of a library. All the bad books, music, magazines and movies no one really wants to read. If a kid picks up the book and reads it, and there are bad content in the books, magazines, music and movies that would be bad to read. If they are young enough and they don't know if the movies or anything else in the library are bad, then it's the library's fault for letting them get the book movies, music or magazines. If the parent doesn't know that their kid read the book their parents will be wondering where they got bad phrases from. There are people that think that any libraries should have any bad books. There can be inappropriate content that they are exposed to.  There are many things in books that parents don't want their children to read. There are things like books that talk about sex. There can also be language that the kids should not read. I know for sure, that I don't want my kids to read anything bad when they grow older.  There are also music that parents don't want kids to listen to. There is things like sex songs. There are also things that don't say sex directly, but imply it. I never want my kids to listen to bad songs like that, I want them to be responsible and not listen to terrible songs.  There is also movies that I don't want my kids to watch, because of the content of the movie. There are so many things in this world that contain bad things, which all have something to do with sex. Latly all the movies that came out are very inapropriate.  Their is one more thing that I think is very important, which is magazines. There are many things that can happen in magazines like porn. I hate when kids are tempted or forced to look at porn. I think in general we should get rid of porn, and descusting pictures in magazines.  Ultimately, protecting children from harmful content is vital, and carefully curating library materials is a way to contribute to their well-being and innocence as they grow up.
21	2998	2	3	Dear news people, I am writing to you because I have my own answer on what people should do with books. I think it is ok for people to write whatever they want because it's a free country where you can do anything that you think you can do. What I am trying to say is that people can write books however they want with anything in it such as drugs, sex, abuse, bad language, and so on you get what I'm saying. I think it's ok to write whatever they want and put whatever it was they wrote about on the shelf. It's the person who is picking a book who gets to choose to read it, and if they don't like what the book was about they don't have to make a big deal about it and cause a problem. People can just not pick the book up and look for another book.  I don't think it's fair that people should make a big deal out of a book that they don't have to read at all; it makes no sense to me, and I bet a lot of people would agree. If I was someone who was against stuff like sex, and drugs and I saw it in a book I would just set it down and look for a book that I would agree with, rather than causing a problem like others would. It just is not fair and it's a waste of time to me if someone has to complain about something so dumb.  So to wrap this thing up I think people who don't like the way books are written should just put it down and not worry about it and buy a book that they feel better off with reading. There is no point to waste time and cause a problem; that's my opinion about this problem, and I hope it is yours too, because focusing on personal choice is a much more productive way to approach reading.
22	2999	2	3	I think that books, magazines, papers etc shouldn't be removed from the librarys because some PEOPLE like to READ them. Some PEOPLE feel that reading a book about there problem will help them get through what ever problem they are having. PEOPLE often say that they are stressed and depressed. Those PEOPLE can get the books and READ them to help them solve there problems. If the books etc are offensive then, the PEOPLE who think they are shouldn't get them. The can't control what books are in the library. Some PEOPLE have problems and some of the books can help them. Alot of PEOPLE I know dont think that alot of books are offensive. Its eather they want to READ them or they dont. If PEOPLE think that books etc are offensive they will just have to deal with it. PEOPLE like to READ all kinds of books and some dont even like to READ. For the PEOPLE who like to READ they can pick whatever book they want that they feel confortable with. If they think that a book is offensive they go past it and find a different book to READ. I suppose if you find a offensive book you could go to the teacher or someone and talk about it. Im sure that they wont do anything about it. The books and other things are there for a reason, 'For PEOPLE To READ', and to understand what there life is and how to fix it. You have to control under the books. You can't tell them what books should be one the shelf and what cant be on the shelf. In conclusion I think that PEOPLE should deal with it because they cant control it, highlighting the importance of individual choice and the availability of diverse resources for personal growth.
23	3000	2	3	Hello, my name is @CAPS1, I feel that there shouldn't be any censorship of media in libraries. If they call it a 'media center,' then why censor any media at all? People know to read the back of a book to see if they want it, so if they see something they don't like they are able to simply put it back on the shelf. People say The @CAPS2 and the @CAPS3 inspired @CAPS4 @PERSON2 to kill @PERSON1, but that is completely speculated; it's all a matter of 'he said she said.' I feel there should be different sections designated for different age groups, but to censor literature is just un-@CAPS5. There should be a parent supervising children @NUM1 and younger, because where it really comes to is the children and them not being exposed to something they're not ready for. There are some magazines and movies I feel shouldn't be in libraries, and those are as follows: pornography, non-educational movies, @CAPS6 @CAPS7, and social networks. I'm not saying to let kids listen to murderous music and jump off of the terrace but, shouldn't there be some leeway on books? Ultimately, libraries should strive to provide a wide range of materials while parents remain responsible for guiding their children's choices. This is an approved message thank you for your time, goodbye.
24	3001	2	3	Books Removed From Shelves? All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that I work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 statement was from @PERSON1. Do you think it is right for young children to look at images that are not appropriate or read something that is talking about sexual content? I do not think any of these materials should be removed from the shelves, but they should be put in a private area where only adults can get to them.  I think they should be put in a certain area, away from children, because children will get ideas from the material that they see and think it is okay to act like that. There are some books and movies out there that teenagers and young children see that are about serial killers and children think it is okay to bring guns to school and it is not okay. Children are reading these books and thinking it is okay to act like their favorite character or acting like their favorite movie star in a movie. Some of the movies that are out there are about doing stupid stuff, and children and teenagers think it is 'cool' because the person that they look up to is doing that, so they want to try it out also. Children get hurt from doing @CAPS1. Whenever a child sees people having sex, they think it is okay to do it too, because those kids in the movies are the same age as they are. I think that movie producers should be aware of what they put out there for children to watch.  When you talk about the book @CAPS2 @CAPS3, you think what a great book. But would you ever think that it would be taken off of shelves because of one word that was used in it? I think that it should stay on the shelves, but if a parent does not want their child to read it, then they do not have to read it. If parents do not want their child to read something then just tell the teacher or child that they cannot read the book. I think the books should stay on the shelves and any material that has any 'bad' content on it should be put in a private section where only adults can get to it.  Do you want your children looking at bad pictures or seeing or reading about something with sexual content? Children are getting bad ideas from books, movies, magazines, and music. They think it is appropriate to act like @CAPS1, because their favorite movie star is performing @CAPS1 way. These books, movies, and magazines need to be put up out of children's reach, so they cannot get anymore bad ideas to do stupid stuff. Therefore, relocating certain materials to an adults-only section strikes a balance between access and protection.
25	3002	2	3	I think almost every movie might offend someone in some way, So if your wanting to take every movie off the shelf then go ahead. Everyone has different taste in movies, music, books, etc. If the music offends you, don't listen to it. If a book does, don't read it. Its as simple as that. So I don't think they should remove the books, music, movies, etc. That could offend someone, and here are my reason why; If you were to remove all the things that might interest the people now a-day, then you wouldn't have anything that entertains the kids instead of them going out and getting in trouble, I believe every person has the right to read, watch, or listen to whatever it is they want to listen to. Also If they find it offensive then they just shouldn't listen that song, watch that movie, or even read the book or magazines. Everyones offended in different ways from another, So we can't help it if a little book, song, etc., offends a person. I also think if you give a kid the chance to read it, and he sees how offensive it might be, it might keep him/her from doing some of the things he might do if he didn't read the book, Also if he watches what movies he wants, he will learn that, not every body is good people. Children read in a wide variety, some read there dr.suess books and other could be reading Bob's books. Depending on the children they should be able to choose what they read, listen to or watch. The only flaw I find about Children down side to some magazines is the fact almost every magazine has atleast some half naked women, or man in it. Children in there younger years through about first year of high school should not have to see that. My final reason is, people have many different tastes in the materials, so I believe they can read what they want as long as it does not offend them. What there reading should not have any effect on others unless they are reading it also. There are so many people that get offended by the littlest things, but they don't see that its life they will get offended more than a hand full of times in there life. In conflusion I think that people should be able to read what they want even the books people find offensive. The offensive things Should not be taken off the shelves. I also feel that if children get to read some things that could be offensive then they will understand the fact that life isn't easy and you will end up being offended. Also that not everyone is good people, and things happen that people don't like but its life. Finally I think people should not have to give up reading, listening to, watching or looking at things that may be interesting to them, because censorship limits personal growth and understanding.
26	3003	2	3	The world is full of offensive material, and there is almost nothing we can do about it. The books that we leave behind influence the future of our society. These materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries because they are part of a large variety of knowledge, and the library is not the last place someone will look for such material. On the logical side of this, the more a person knows, the more power one has. That doesn't mean that some items, such as certain types of music or movies, are appropriate for his or her age. Some parents get really offended when they see something slightly inappropriate, but the thing to remember is that those so-called little children will sooner or later see such items; it is just a part of growing up, part of life and its challenges.  In the last paragraph, it suggested that a person should have a large mass of information to choose from because there is not a perfect little soul, and everyone has amounts of curiosity. For example, things like @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 are taught in school and could be considered dangerous. In @ORGANIZATION1, like chemistry, we learn the ways of atoms and make predictions of how they will react with other chemicals. When in the lab, students are required to wear safety material because of the dangerous environment. The same goes for @CAPS1, such as health, where one learns about how to live a healthy life, and this requires students to learn about the human body, such as the reproductive systems. In these @CAPS3, such as academic subjects, we learn better how the world works around us, and with this, we learn things that can be dangerous.  With everything that we do, there are positive and negative outcomes. What I am suggesting is that we need to find a healthy balance of what is really needed and the materials that are strictly entertainment, and those items should be removed. If it has some purpose behind it, then it holds a place, but if it is some magazine talking about drama, it appears very useless, a waste of time.  In this large world, there always was and always will be people or material that are a bad influence. Yet, this is all a matter of perception, and everyone has different tolerances and values. With this ongoing problem, we shall make this judgment with the best of our abilities, based off of our values, striving to find a balance that respects both individual freedom and the need for responsible curation.
27	3004	2	3	People are entitled to their own opinion about things. What someone might find offensive, someone else might not. Libraries should be able to put anything that might interest a person or educate someone on their shelves, whether people get offended or not. If we went by what everyone said, we probably wouldn't have anything on the library shelves. People will find something wrong with everything a person can put out; that's just human nature. I have read nonfiction books and saw movies that are based on true stories that have used words and language that some people might find offensive, but how are people going to express their feelings and educate people without offending someone? How are we supposed to teach history without telling the whole story? Slavery and the Holocaust were horrible things that happened, and teaching about them is important so that it does not happen again. It would be hard to teach about these horrible events without offending people. I believe that we should put these materials on our library shelves anyway, and if people do not like it, then do not check them out or look at them. That's my opinion, and ultimately, the freedom to choose what we read is essential for learning and understanding different perspectives.
28	3005	2	3	I think if people find books offensive they should not even read that book to begin with. If books are found offensive and taken from shelves then book shelves would be empty. Then there would be nothing left for people to read. Some of the greatest authors use offensive words in their books; take them off the shelves and you will be getting rid of the greatest material. @PERSON1 @CAPS1, for example, in the book '@CAPS2' its offensive to gays and one gets killed. Removing such works based on offense would impoverish our literary landscape and limit access to diverse perspectives, even those that may be considered problematic.
29	3006	2	3	A book is more than words or happenings; they're adventures and stories that travel from one person to another. I find it amazing how someone from one country could write a book, then someone from another country could read it. Inspiring stories reach from one person to another in books, music, and movies; I believe things like that help shape us into who we are today. There are many problems with entertainment today in my oppinion. They include things now that show a lot of violence and intimacy; which might not be fit for some people. I don't think they should take them off the shelves, but simply rate them so everyone knows what to expect. Movies are rated because some people don't want or need to see what will happen in them. While some of it is not appropriate, other parts of it guide us. It's almost like they are preparing us for the worst, but are hoping for the best. We see what happens to one person in these articles of entertainment, and it helps us to make sure we don't make the same mistake. I also believe that many stories and movies inspire us to be better people and to reach for our dreams. If we see that one person can do it, we think, why can't I? Where would we be in the world if no one encouraged or pushed someone else to do what they wanted? Entertainment pushes that concept, but adds everything in it to show the reality of it. Whether these things have offense or harsh contents to them, they still prepare and help us to battle through everyday life, ultimately making entertainment a crucial, if sometimes controversial, component in shaping our understanding of the world.
30	3007	2	3	I don't believe that certain books, music, magazines, or movies should be removed. If they are found offensive then that is not my problem. If they offend me then oh well that is my issue to deal with. When it comes to any of the mentioned items, sooner or later society will find them again and they will be back on the shelves. No matter how offensive they are curiosity will bring them back on the shelves. If a book is found offensive by one person or group of people that doesn't mean it should be removed off of the shelves. That is a problem that the one person or group of people will have to live with. Anything and everything is educational in its own way. Even if it is offensive it can teach someone wrong from right. That being said is it wrong or right for someone to want something offensive to removed from the shelves? It depends on a person's personal views or beliefs. Whether they like it or not things are offensive to somebody out there and there is nothing we can do out there to change that. It's sad to admit, but there really isn't anything to change that. It's just easier to live with it. Maybe whatever you found offensive wasn't meant to be offensive. It depends on what you take offence to. Maybe the writer, director, or composer meant for something to be offensive, maybe they didn't. It's all based on how you take what they said into thought. So when it boils down to it nothing should be removed from the shelves, because censorship limits access to potentially valuable perspectives. For if one thing must be removed then you might as well remove everything, and that would be a disservice to the diversity of thought and expression.
31	3008	2	3	I absolutely do not think that any book, movie, magazine, music, etc., should be removed from the shelf because they find it offensive. If we do that, then all the books would be off the shelf. Sometimes the really good books are when they are offensive, because they are actually telling you what they really believe in. I remember when I was twelve, the news was saying that a school was taking books off the shelf because it offended one person in the school. The shocking part was that almost the whole school was reading that book. Even teachers were reading it. The school board did not even care though. I think that was completely handled the wrong way. They should have talked to the girl and said it was unfair to ask that when everybody reads it. If it offended her, then she should not read it.  Music is an outlet for many people. They can express their feelings in a way that is amazing. Without music, there would not be any fun in the world. People are always listening to music. When they are sad, mad, upset, confused, etc. If people think some kind of music is offensive, then they should not listen to it. There is so much music out there that there is no need to listen to something that is offensive to you.  Movies are going to be offensive to at least one thing all the time. That is what makes a movie: a hero and a villain. We want the good guys to win. The movie makes fun of the bad guys. Somebody is always going to get hurt. That is part of the story, and often reflects some aspect of real-world conflict, even if in an exaggerated way.  When I read, watch, or listen to something, I do not think of how offensive it is to me or somebody else. I think of how the artist feels. Why they wrote it that certain way. If I am listening to music, I listen to the beat and the words at first. Then if I like it, I start singing it. If I do not like it, then I just change the song. I try to understand the message and the emotion behind it.  I hope people do not end up just taking things off the shelf when someone is offended. We need the different opinions in life. If we all had the same opinions, we would not be ourselves in anyway. I do not want to be the same as everybody else. I love my personality. I am different and kind of an outcast. But I am true to myself. And I respect other people's opinions. I wish everyone would do the same. Or at least try to do the same, because it is important to have a society where diverse perspectives are valued, not silenced, even when those perspectives are challenging or uncomfortable. Thank you for listening to what I had to say.
32	3009	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should not be removed from certain library shelves because people have enough sense on what they are interested in and what they are not interested in. There will always be people that find specific thoughts or ideas offensive no matter what the subject is, so censorship does not really make a difference to the individual. Censorship is not necessary because people know what they are interested in without anyone helping them find what they are looking for. Censorship is not entirely necessary because people will always find something that they are not exactly looking for or interested in. People's interests are their own business without the censorship of others in the surrounding community. I've read a couple books that have cussing in them, but the book is still as good as it would be without the cussing in it. People like things no matter what, because there will always be flaws with some objects such as books, music, and movies. Books, music, and movies all have much interest from the common person, and each individual is capable of making their own decisions based on what they are interested in. The individual does not need edited objects, or music to listen to the music or other objects without being offended. There is something offensive to people in every work that has been published, and the buyer is fully aware of that fact before they go and buy something. Individuals also understand that art is subjective and open to interpretation, further diminishing the need for intervention. Censorship is not necessary because individuals are aware of what they are interested without anything telling them what to look for. People will almost always get offended about what they are watching or listening to no matter what it is, so why is censorship such a big deal? Censorship is not needed in today's society because each specific individual is capable of making their own decision in what's best for themselves. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should not be taken away from the library shelves because there will always be some offensive objects that some individuals will find offensive no matter what the object is, and the freedom to choose what to engage with should be protected.
33	3010	2	3	
34	3011	2	3	Would you want your children reading about things that only experts know? When you go to a library you expect to learn about history, science, knowledge of LOCATION1's culture, literature etc. Libraries are for learning new things about the world that will later help you in adulthood. When you first walk into a library you expect to see people checking out history books, or books that catch your eye just by the title. If we find a book is offensive, or will not help better our childrens' future then stand up and fight for their own mental development. We must also think of what the children want to read. They have the right to read whatever they want, as long as it's entertaining to them and they are learning something new. Some books teaches them about the world they are growing up in. There are some books that I would not let my own child read, but I know in my heart that she is learning something that I might not be able to teach her. Those types of books of are what I call, 'controversial's'. Those books that can come off seeming offensive, when in the end they are actually, what I call 'eye-opening', helping to prepare them for what is it come. Not every book will be full of rainbows, pretty colors, or pop-ups. They must know that they are some people they have to be mindful of, and people who are educating them on adulthood. They have to learn the difference between what's right, and what's wrong. Remember the first book you ever read by yourself? I do. It was called 'Of Mice and Men'. I read that book when I was 10. Till this day my mother says, 'I tried to stop you from reading that book so many times, it had dangerous wording that an 10 year should no be able to read at that young age'. What she did not know was that; that book had taught me a lot about the world back then. That knowledge I had obtain then had helped me later on my adulthood. Some books are meant to be read while some aren't. If you feel your child should not read a certain book then read it for yourself, and then tell your child the reason why they can not read the same book you had just read, thus guiding their understanding and ensuring their well-being.
35	3012	2	3	Libraries have a lot of material to read, from children's books to adult books, varying across different age groups. Many people visit the library daily. But should certain materials be removed from the shelves because they are found offensive? The answer is no. When people go to the library, they want to learn something or find something to entertain them. When you go to the library to research something, and they do not have the book or movie you need, what are you going to do? What happens when you are doing a project, and they do not have the necessary book? Do you want your children failing in school because libraries remove materials? People should not remove materials because 'they do not like it.' If they think it is offensive, they should put it back and find something else. They do not have to remove it simply because they are against it; everyone has different beliefs. Libraries have different sections, like kids, fiction, and nonfiction, often organized by topic. No one should remove something offensive because they chose to look at it. No one can dictate what you can and cannot look at in a library. If you dislike what you see, put it down; it's that easy. If you cannot find what you are looking for, libraries also have computers to look things up, ensuring a wide range of resources remain available to everyone. Ultimately, removing materials based on personal offense limits access to information and undermines the library's purpose of providing diverse resources for all.
36	3013	2	3	A book represents a person's beliefs and feelngs about a topic. Therefore censoring books is wrong because it goes against freedom of speech. I do not believe books, or other media should be removed because while it may be offensive, if it is the truth about something then we need to read about it to prevent tragedies from happening again. A person who finds a topic offensive isn't forced to read about it. If we do not accept other people beliefs, we are just as prejudice as the books we are trying to censor. Many books that are threatened by censorship are books about historical facts, such as the holocaust. I think we have the right to know about important events. For one reason, if we forget about such things, than they are more likely to be repeated. Do we really want the murder of millions of people to be repeated? Just becaused we are ashamed of something dosen't mean we should sweep it under the carpet where it can lay hidden waiting to stike again like a hungry alligator. Instead books about prejudice events should be kept out to show an example of how we shouldn't act. While some books are censored because of shame, some are censored because a certain group of people may find it offensive. There is a much easier solution that censoring those books. The offended groups should just ignore the book. If it is offensive in the first place then no one should be forced to read it. The book shouldn't be forced in any other way like posters, and television broadcast. It should be kept in a certain section of a library so parties wishing to avoid it can. The main reason for a book to be censored in the first place is because someone finds in offensive. However, isn't keeping someone from saying something just as offensive? To censor The Diary of Anne Frank is a big target for censorship, but it is about treating everyone fairly. If that book like that was censored, it would be like saying some people are better than others. Another big target for censorship in some countries is the Quran. Censoring that book would basically tell the Muslim population that they are wrong. Censoring something is wrong. Not only could it cause sad events to repeat themselves, offended parties can just simply avoid the book. While some books offend people, censoring a book can be just as offensive to other parties. The simplest thing to do is to leave it up to the reader to decid if they should read it, or not, respecting their autonomy and right to information.
37	3014	2	3	There are many types of materials in the library to entertain you. Some of these materials @MONTH1 be books, magazines, movies, and music. Each person has their own type of information and genres that they like. For example, most teenage girls love to read young romance stories, and about young peoples' lives; @CAPS1 people like informational books. Everyone is different in their own way. The material they choose to read is their own choice. How would you feel if one of your favorite books or magazine were taken off the shelves of all the libraries? You would probably wonder why such a thing would happen. Well, some people would like to argue about how some of the information that is contained in such materials are offensive or innapropriate. They want these types of things to be taken off the shelves. But is it their decision to say that some things offend people? Everyone has their own opinion and can make their own choice on what they want to read or what they do not want to read. In my opinion, these types of materials should stay on the shelves. It is simple, if you do not like a certain genre of magazines or books, do not read them. If you hear someones music, and it sounds completely awful to you, then just walk away or listen to your own music. Theres a new movie out about how the world is going to end, and you disbelieve in the fact that the world will not end that way, do not go and see it. Some parents do not want their children to know about some of the things that are out there in the world, which is completely understandable. But, everyone has rights to what they want to know and what they do not want to know. If everyone had a right to take away some books that they think are not appropriate, do you think there would be any books left? The thing is, is that in today's society, people want to do what they want and think what they want. Some people do not agree with most things, but that is something they will have to face, because not everyone can be happy. Some of these materials @MONTH1 include e-books and audiobooks, offering diverse formats to suit different preferences. @CAPS1 also enjoy biographies and historical accounts. The library is a space for exploration and discovery, and limiting access restricts individual growth. It is important to respect individual choices and maintain a diverse collection.
38	3015	2	3	Should certain materials be removed from the shelves of the library that are found offensive? @PERSON1 states that we will have no books left of the shelf to read if everyone removes a book they do not approve of. What some people think is the most innocent book, could offend another individual. Different people find different topics offensive. No two people think the same. Though certain books or magazines @MONTH1 have offensive subjects or materials in them, if they were to be removed, how would we learn? For example, say there was a historical fiction book about racism. The book might show different perspectives of how people lived when racism flourished. Readers could learn from the books how racism affects people, and why it is wrong. Learning about dislikes can make someone more knowledgeable on why some people think the way they do. The readers can learn from mistakes made in the past. Books or movies depict how life was years or even centuries ago; morals were different a while ago from what they are now, shaping our understanding of societal evolution.  If many people were to agree that a certain material is very offensive or not appropriate for adolescents or young children, one option that could be available is only allowing adults to check it out. The library could also put a warning on it if they think the content of the material is too harsh, ensuring informed decisions. Another idea could be setting up reviews on a website with a list of each book in the library. Consumers can read the review first and then decide whether to check it out or not, promoting personal choice.  People have their own opinions and views on materials. A person should learn to be tolerant of materials; others might truly enjoy it. This article might be offensive to those who read it, because they might think things should be more censored rather than tolerated. If someone does not like the material, they are not forced to check it out of the library so why cause a fuss over it? One person might find a topic very offensive while that same topic sparks interest in another individual. Each person has different morals so who is to say what should and should not be in a library? Ultimately, maintaining a diverse collection and respecting individual choices fosters a more informed and understanding community.
39	3016	2	3	One essential right that every man, woman, or child should have is the freedom of speech. Without this right no one would be able to express their views. When libraries pull books, magazines, movies, and music off of their shelves it takes away that right. Even if the matter of the subject is offensive to some people, the books or other items should be left on the shelves. What one person finds offensive another could find miraculous. If one person does not find the content of a book attractive then simply do not read the book. Libraries should not censor the material that they put on the shelves just because someone does not like it. I do think however, that books should be placed in the section that they belong. Sections for childrens books, young adult books, adult books, and many more can all be found in a library. An example would be that a book about the anatomy of the human body does not belong in the childrens section. beyond this, the library should leave the rest of the decisons to the reader. If someone wanted to read a book on the solar system, then that person should be able to go to a library and check the book out. The problem with censorship is that a parent could find the book offensive and want it removed from the shelves. Then the person interested in the solar system would not be able to withdrawl the book. The choice of what material you read should be left up to you, not restricted by what someone else finds offensive. Libraries should not remove items from their shelves if someone else finds it offensive to their own beliefs. The person should just not read the book. Everyone is going to have a different opinion on most things and therefore, there should not be censorship in libraries. Ultimately, respecting individual choice in reading material is crucial to upholding the principles of intellectual freedom and fostering a diverse and informed society.
40	3017	2	3	Writing is a way to express one's thoughts and ideas on a page. In this country, an author can write freely about whatever he desires and he is not subject to penalty for doing so. Sometimes reading these works can be enjoyable, other times it can be rather disturbing. However, just because a work is offensive does not mean that it is not worth reading. Books, manuscripts, and other forms of literature should not be taken off the shelves even if they are disturbing or offensive. The *Jungle*, a book written by Upton Sinclair, revealed the horrible practices of the meat packing industry. It was offensive to many, and in addition it caused an uprising among consumers because of its content. However, there is a reason that book is still talked about today. If there had been laws prohibiting him from writing about the horrific things that were taking place in those factories, it is quite possible and actually very likely that the industry wouldn't have been reformed for a long time. Fortunately, Upton Sinclair exposed the horrific processes that took place in the industry and the government stepped in and solved the problem. Someone out there hates this book, and hated it from the day it was published. But that doesn't mean he has the right to remove it from the shelves and prevent all others from reading it. Too often students are forced to read works of fiction and stories that, although they are beneficial for students, do not inform students about the world in which they find themselves. It is important for a student to read Shakespeare, and the works by Poe and London. However, students must learn and begin to understand the world in which they currently find themselves, the eras of the past, and the circumstances that they will find themselves in for decades to come. They must learn how to become successful in life. They should read works by Hill, such as *Think and Grow Rich*, which essentially tells the story of success and what seperates the average from the great. Someone out there hates these works, and he should not have the right to ruin the opportunity that these books and short stories could give someone else. Reading is the best way to learn. In a world of social networking and 'screens' of all types, the importance of reading has been diminished. Students must develop a love of reading, and if everyone who hates a book takes it off the shelves, then, as Paterson said, 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' No book should ever be taken off the shelves. Never. By preserving access to a wide range of literature, even that which is controversial, we allow for the continuation of learning, growth, and progress within society.
41	3018	2	3	Dear Newspaper, I believe that no book should be taken off the shelves for any reason. People may not be mature enough for some books, music, magazines, etc., and so the libraries that have a problem with some of the materials then maybe they should put a limit to age on checking out certain things. Libraries keep all types of books and magazines so what would be their reason to take the material off the shelf? I think that there are different types of people in the world and everyone's going to want to read something different.  If libraries are going to take the material off the shelf that people don't like then the material that others like would be gone. For instance, if I were to take the 'Harry Potter' series off the shelves then all the 'Harry Potter' fans would be furious and upset. But knowing that lots of people like the series, my library isn't going to do that. There are a lot of books that parents don't want their children to read, but libraries aren't going to take them off the shelves.  Some parents aren't going to want their children and teenagers to read a romantic, racy book but that's what other adults enjoy reading. Those books aren't going to go away but if parents have problems with it then maybe they should mention to the library to put an age limit to them. The parents could also check on what their child or teenager is reading. But those books will be in libraries forever and you can't make them go away because you don't want your children to read them.  From experience, I've read a couple racy books and they are disturbing for me, being an immature audience. But I'm not going to ask for the books to be taken off the shelf. Some books are very vulgar and nasty in the ways they describe fights or wars or abuse but some people like reading literature like that so the libraries will keep them. If people have problems with books then stay away from them and don't read them. It's as simple as that.  In conclusion, I think all books should stay on the shelves because all people have different interests and opinions. If anyone has a problem with a book for being racy or vulgar then they shouldn't read that book, and if they don't want their children and teenagers to read the book either then they should be a parent and not let them. They can't blame the library for books they don't want their kids to read because that's not fair to the people who enjoy those books and like to read them.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
42	3019	2	3	"Many disagree with school libraries due to the books, magazines, articles, and internet access that may contain disturbing content for children, like violence, drugs, and nudity. Parents are concerned about their children's access to uncensored material, while others may not be as vigilant. Libraries today are seemingly not focused on the materials they provide, potentially leading children to emulate negative behaviors seen in such content, thinking it's ""cool"" to engage in drugs, violence, or nudity. Censored content, conversely, might not hold their interest. Parents believe uncensored material should be kept away from children.  Libraries should be more responsible for their content, addressing the presence of offensive and uncensored material. Removing such content is crucial to protect children from exposure. Some parents are uninvolved in their children's education and activities, a concern given the potential exposure to inappropriate content. Parents should be more aware and proactively teach their children about sensitive topics.  Ultimately, both parents and libraries share the responsibility of safeguarding children from offensive content. Children should not be exposed to such material, and the onus falls on parents and libraries to ensure a safe and appropriate learning environment. Addressing this shared responsibility will help protect children from potentially harmful influences and foster a more positive educational experience."
43	3020	2	3	Do you want your nine year old CHILDREN talking and reading about inapproprieate subjects such as sexual relationships or language? No! I know I wouldn't for my CHILDREN. I think books that are offensive and inapproprieate shouldn't be in OUR school or elementray schools with little ones or even 9 years olds. And parents should be in conrol of what thier kids watch and listen too. Honstley we can't control how people make movies or what singers are saying in songs but we can control who listens to them and watches them. Its the parents that are the only ones who can control thier children, no one else. In libraries I feel like its the librarians who are the cause for letting children read offensive books. And I don't mean any disrespect but wouldn't you agree? I mean think about it, librarians are the ones in control of the books that are in the library, and I think that they should make sure that the book young teens are checking out are appropraite enough for them to read. Ones that don't involve sex or violence that 9 year olds shouldn't be reading. Here's an idea, maybe libraries should have 14 year olds sign a paper or have a certain card with them that allows them to check out that certain book or MAGAZINES. And it should have parents permisson on it showing that the parents approve of this. But I think high schoolers should only be aloud to do this because they are more mature than younger ones. They know better than to start fights or cuss in school. All I'm saying is that I DO agree with this problem, parents are the reason thier kids are immature and rude because they LET thier children get away with the attitude and rudeness. So yes parents and other people do have the right to sensor movies and book, etc. But what about MAGAZINE theaters you ask? DONT LET YOUR CHILDREN GO TO THE MAGAZINE SHOWS NEAR YOU!!! It's that simple. Students in high school GO to the SHOWS after school with friends and get in to see rated R movies WITHOUT parents. And I do believe that some of them use fake IDS so they don't need a parent with them. Teens will GO home that night and want to re-enact what they saw in the MAGAZINE. Even if it's sex, or fights or even language. It's really sad that parents allow this to happen and I think the parents should grow up and disapline thier students. I've seen to many parents letting thier children get away with thier mouth and attitude. Most of my friends parents LET thier children get away with everything. One of my friends is really bad at getting what she wants. She told me that all she has to do is cry and she gets what she wants. I don't always get what I want and I don't want every new thing out there because I don't deserve it. I have to earn to get a new phone or a laptop. I ask my parents and they eaither say we don't have enough money or you don't need it and I just move on with my life. But I don't LET books or movies control my life and change who I am. Those things aren't that important. I mean the ones that talk about school or some random story that some stranger wrote and it just happened to show up in the school libraries. The stories or movies, etc., that teens should really pay attention to are the edicational ones. The ones that teach us about life and society. About the future and teach us how life is as an adult and ready us for the real world. Because once those seniors open those high school doors and graduate it's no more staying up late and sleeping in and parting on the weekends. Its the real world, the adult world. So please read this carefully and I hope what I have said has helped you realize why people sensor these things. Why kids are acting the way they are. Libraries should sensor certain things and not allow students below high school to read them. Please think about what I have said, and hopefully you now understand why it's crucial to consider censorship. Thank you for taking your time out of your day to read this.
44	3021	2	3	In this millennium, we really shouldn't be too concerned about censorship. People say way worse in public and do worse things in public. On the other side of this, the parents of a child should be watching their kid and looking to see what they are about to grab off the shelf. It's the parents' fault if their child gets ahold of a book that has adult content on or in it. So why should we have censorship?  If a CD contains adult content and the child is underage and grabs it off the shelf listening to it, then it's the parents' fault for not being responsible enough to watch their child. Same goes for books, movies, and so on. Now if the child is old enough to understand what they grab then they should be able to listen to it, and ask questions about it. If it's about adult relationships and the child takes it, then the parent should explain it all and tell them what is going on. The parent should be the one to take responsibility.  Now, if a book, music, movie, magazine, and etc. contain racism in it then it should be censored, unless it's about history. Kids under the age of teen usually repeat what they hear or read. Same goes for teenagers too actually! Books with the wrong kind of words in it should be kept safe or there should be an age to where you can get it. The world has enough horrid language in it, why should the library add to it by letting kids get ahold of these books and repeating what they hear.  I remember when I was walking around a library and I saw a little kid not older than 2 grab an adult book and started to open it and look through it. The parent was nowhere to be seen nor heard, who leaves their child in a book section like that? This young boy put the book down on the hard floor and started to take off his clothes. This was no one's fault, wasn't the library, wasn't mine. People should take responsibility, control their kids and if they can't then leave them at home!  There are also certain people who need books for research and need to take home books for their projects. We shouldn't have censorship and take down all the books that should be contained from kids. Some of us need those kind of books in order for us to do our research and projects!  No, we shouldn't have censorship in our libraries! I'm not about to miss a project or miss a good movie because some parents don't know how to control their kids and watch what they grab. We should be able to keep all the books, movies, magazines, and etc., there could be a way to censor most books but they would need their own shelf, and there could be an age limit or a pass people could use. That would take too long to do so though. So, keep our libraries filled with interesting things without censoring them; parental responsibility, not censorship, is the key.
45	3022	2	3	Libraries, to myself, are a gateway to another world; where I can be who I want to be, and let my imagination wander where ever it pleases. Libraries should not have the ability to take a book off the shelves depending on it's content. We are all different people, we all don't enjoy the same kind of books. Also, some books @MONTH1 be needed for research. Censorship in a library should not be allowed. First, there are so many different people in the world. Some people learn more about people from books. Imagine yourself a white, @NUM1 year old boy, growing up in an all white town. Never in your life have you seen an @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You go to the library and pick up 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS4 young boy has never been introduced to such racism. Books are history. Books are learning. Books can not be taken off the shelf just for their content; that content might be a whole other world for a young child. Next, libraries are used so often by college students to writer papers for school; books are needed for research. For an example, you're a college student writing a research paper on abuse--including sexual, physical, and mental. A young author writes a non-fiction novel about her childhood ranging from being raped by her father at six years old to being bullied in school. After hours of searching, you find all local libraries have removed @CAPS4 book for it's explicit content. College students need books no matter what they're about. Libraries are open to people of all age. It is understandable that a twelve year old could easily get a hold of a book inappropriate for their age level, but that's why libraries are split into sections. If you find a book that is considered to be taken off the shelves, don't remove it, just move it to a more secure and mature area. Books should not be taken off the shelves because of content; instead, they should be moved to a more mature section in the library.
46	3023	2	3	Book @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think about removing certain materials such as books, music, movies, and-or magazines is that it should be your choice. I always thought that was part of our constitutional right. I read alot of urban books because that's @CAPS2 I enjoy. They realae towhere I have been, or where I @MONTH1 be going in my life. No they are not the kinds of books I would read to my grand childern, but they @MONTH1 choose later in life that they also enjoy urban books and movies. You @MONTH1 not enjoy reading the materials that I enjoy either but that doesn't mean you should banned them. There are alot of books, and movies that I don't care for but I wouldn't ask for them to be banned. If everyone started @CAPS1 @CAPS2 they don't like, there wouldn't be any need for movies, libraries, or book stores. Kids wouldn't have a future because they wouldn't know where they came from. @CAPS2's bad to you @MONTH1 not be bad to me, or the next person. When you go into a library, or book store, you already have and idea of @CAPS2 you are looking for. If there are books that are not appropreiate for kids, they should have their own section that reads, 'For @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. We are the @CAPS3 and parents. We should be the one's in control of our kids and @CAPS2 they read and watch. I don't think @CAPS1 the materials would make the problem go away because kids these days, if they want them bad enough, will figure out away to read or watch them anyway. Ann @CAPS5 and @CAPS6.  Book banning raises complex questions about individual liberties and censorship. When I think about removing certain materials such as books, music, movies, and-or magazines is that it should be your choice. I always thought that was part of our constitutional right. I read a lot of urban books because that's @CAPS2 I enjoy. They relate to where I have been, or where I @MONTH1 be going in my life. No, they are not the kinds of books I would read to my grandchildren, but they @MONTH1 choose later in life that they also enjoy urban books and movies. You @MONTH1 not enjoy reading the materials that I enjoy either, but that doesn't mean you should ban them. There are a lot of books, and movies that I don't care for, but I wouldn't ask for them to be banned. If everyone started @CAPS1 @CAPS2 they don't like, there wouldn't be any need for movies, libraries, or book stores. Kids wouldn't have a future because they wouldn't know where they came from. @CAPS2's bad to you @MONTH1 not be bad to me, or the next person. When you go into a library, or book store, you already have an idea of @CAPS2 you are looking for. If there are books that are not appropriate for kids, they should have their own section that reads, 'For @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. We are the @CAPS3 and parents. We should be the ones in control of our kids and @CAPS2 they read and watch. I don't think @CAPS1 the materials would make the problem go away because kids these days, if they want them bad enough, will figure out a way to read or watch them anyway. Ultimately, it is up to each individual and family to decide what they deem suitable for themselves and their children, and we must respect those choices and trust in their judgment. Ann @CAPS5 and @CAPS6.
47	3024	2	3	Libraries are our way of knowing what has happened in the past whether it is all fact or maybe fiction. No matter what type of book it is, it still tells us a story of another place and another time. Libraries should not be censored. Taking away one book because of one sentence that seems vulgar and inappropriate for young readers is wrong. I understand that reading books with adult material such as drug abuse and sexuality can lead to experimentation but is that not life? At least once in our existence on earth we find ourselves curious about something and we try it, just to see what it is like. It is all a learning experience. History would most likely be the touchiest subject in our libraries mainly because we are ashamed of what we acted like thirty plus years ago, discrimination in America, the Civil Rights Movement, and now the wars in the middle east. Some countries do not even teach their own history to students in school because they are embarrassed of what happened or afraid that it might happen again if the students know the truth, why and what happened. Reading and knowing about what our ancestors did will help us lead a better future not destroy it. Today's media has overflowed with adult material not suitable for kids under 13. If anything we need to start censoring what we broadcast on television and also what we post on the internet and leave our libraries alone. Most of the books that are in our libraries has been there for like forty years so it is completely pointless to remove it when it has already educated young minds for over forty years. I truthfully do not know why you would want to remove books or censor them with a sharpie marker. All that is doing is giving readers less material to read. In Florida, elementary educators are not required to teach their students how to spell, at all. I walked into a third grade classroom and watched a girl spell friend 'frend' thinking that was the correct why to spell friend. The school district's excuse for not having teachers teach how to spell is that they should learn that from reading books everyday. Well guess what Florida, with the internet, gaming systems and iPods, little kids are not taking to reading like they did ten years ago and we are going to have a lot of future adults not know how to read and this is what it is going to be like. 'How do you spell encyclopedia?' 'Should I know, I wasn't taught how to spell in Florida.' You see what I mean, so if you are going to take away the ability to spell you better not take away our books because they are the only things teaching our student's future on how to spell simple words. Today we have the internet, gaming systems, iPods and Netflix to entertain us on a daily basis. No one is taking to reading as a way to relieve boredom, they are just sitting on the couch watching television. And now if you reduce reading material for teens and young readers you are not encouraging us to read. You are taking away all of the interesting parts of a book. To be truthful I will read and reread a book many times over if it is a good story with some extra sizzle. I do not enjoy books that do not have drugs, alcohol, family stress, war stories or even some sexuality mainly because books without that are boring. When I read books like that they make me feel better about my life and how I interact with others. I have learned how to deal with all of those things from books. Most of my knowledge comes from those types of books and I would hate for my children to not be able to read the same materials as I did at their age and learn from those books, so it is vital that we protect our libraries from censorship.
48	3025	2	3	I believe certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should never be removed from libraries because even if offensive, people still have the right to access that information. I make this opinion based on the guidelines our country was built on, freedom of speech and equality for everyone. If we started removing books, movies, etc., from our libraries for being offensive, where would we draw the line between offensive and not? To remove even one book from a library for offending a certain race or culture would be the beginning of a tornado of books being removed by everyone who has ever not agreed with what is said about them or about their culture and lifestyles. Now, let's stop and think about what it means for something to be offensive in the first place. People are offended by things in our world every day, and books and movies in our libraries are probably pretty low down on the offensive totem pole next to, say, the internet or news, I would think, wouldn't you? Plus, the materials we provide to our libraries with are for people to learn and teach; they aren't made to be offensive or rude, and in my experience with libraries being a long-time user, I have never found anything to be offensive or hurtful to anyone. In my conclusion, there are just too many books about too many subjects already written to even begin to go through which ones are offensive or not and to whom. Ultimately, libraries are a place of learning and teaching, and the information inside is meant to be helpful and constructive, not offensive or hurtful, and to start removing materials now would eventually lead to the end of libraries as we know them.
49	3026	2	3	Have you ever been offended? Did you lash out, or did you keep an open mind and come try understanding? People are offended by many things every day in life. So, we should broaden our minds, and see these 'offenses' as a normality. You're at a party with a bowl full of candy stationed right beside the front door. You walk in and take a piece. Wait, you don't want that piece? What are you going to do with it? Do you take all of the same pieces that you don't like out of the bowl and throw them away, or do you simply drop it back into the bowl and choose a new one? If you throw the candy away, what does that mean for the other party guests? You have narrowed their choices down because of your own selfish opinion. That candy could have been the guest favorite. But, since YOU don't like it, you take away the other guests' privilege to eat that candy. They didn't deserve that, now did they?  If you're searching through books in a library and you come across a book that doesn't interest you or offends you, then put it back and look for a new one. If you're having trouble finding the right book, ask the librarian for suggestions on other topics or books to check out. Go to a new library, even, but don't mess with something that isn't yours. Especially, something as small as a book. Books offer a diverse range of perspectives and ideas, and discarding or censoring them limits access to information and stifles intellectual exploration.  The point of the matter is, if you don't like something then disregard it. The moment the book, and the book alone, starts causing problems is the moment anyone should intervene. But, come on, do you really think a book could cause a problem? If your child is having problems, don't you think you ought to check what's going on with him instead of looking to see if he/she checked out the 'book that we hope none of our children' took off the shelf. This is quite possibly one of the last things I would think of causing a problem, if I even thought of this at all. Opinions can cause a lot of problems. Sometimes, people just need to keep their opinions to themselves, agreed? Ultimately, respecting the choices and preferences of others, even when they differ from our own, fosters a more inclusive and tolerant environment for everyone.
50	3027	2	3	Libraries sometimes contain books offensive to humans and animals. The books can contain negative comments just to entertain readers. I believe all books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they contain offensive and negative things about any human. For example, in political cartoons in newspapers, @PERSON1 is sometimes compared with a @CAPS1. We as @CAPS2 @CAPS3 take it very offensively when someone in our race is called a @CAPS1. I take that very offensively because, back when black people were not able to do certain things, white people would refer to black people as monkeys. Being offended is not a good thing, and the last place offensive stuff needs to be is in libraries. Libraries are supposed to hold positive material, books that give knowledge to people, not things containing negative depictions of human life. Also, children should be able to pick up a book and not feel offended by it. One night, my little brother came home with a book he got from the library. It was about a white dog and a dark-colored dog together trying to find food and a place to sleep. But one day, the dark-colored dog was left out in the cold while a loving family took the white dog into their warm home. My brother felt so uncomfortable with that book he took it back that same night. Libraries can contain very offensive things that can make a person sick to their stomach. Offensive things can hurt a person's feelings, and libraries should be the last place where a person should feel uncomfortable reading a book. Even though my brother found a book he disliked, he continues to go to the library to find excellent books to read. Libraries are fun to go to, but they can contain very offensive things that can hurt a person's feelings, and it is important to be mindful of the impact these materials can have.
51	3028	2	3	Censorship is found on television, in libraries, in schools, and even in homes. Do you think that censorship should be used? Censorship can be used to block one's personal thoughts and opinions to promote conformism. I disagree with the idea of Censorship. Not everyone thinks people should be able to have their own images and visions; however, that is what makes our world so individualized. Censorship in libraries is growing more and more gradually. The government does not want the society, especially the youth, of @LOCATION1 to read things that are deemed inappropriate. Should that not be up to one's guardian, or if they are old enough, to oneself? When you read books, you see language being block out, they take parts out to make the book seem more classy, also they block out things such as drugs and alcohol. A lot of people believe that books are what hurt a lot of today's society. I believe that reading material could be a lot more educational if the editors would leave some of the things that they censor, in the book. I believe this because, if parents decide to not let their child read a story that is up to them; however, their child could learn about certain situations and possibly learn how to handle those difficult things. This opinion that censorship in books could be absolutely debatable. Censorship such as in the book, @ORGANIZATION1 is being used. The government is taking out certain words in this story because they are seen as offensive. This is understandable also. I do not believe this amazing novel should be seen in this way. The language was not meaning to be used offensively, but simply to state how people talked and how things were when @PERSON1 was alive. If it were not for books like this, how would out society learn about not only @LOCATION1's history, but other culture's history? In all fairness, @ORGANIZATION1 is an educational novel about how times were in the day of @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1. Censorship in movies is also growing. Television will block out things such as language, nudity, alcohol, drugs, and things of that nature. I would not like to turn on the television and see these things everywhere, but it could educate people on what and what not to do. I believe if censorship were not used, people's thoughts would be more apt to imagine. Imagination can scare people. Some think that imagination can turn someone crazy or into doing something that is not normal; but what is normal? It is to the community, doing what everyone else is doing and not being different, this scares people. Such conformity can stifle creativity and prevent progress. This whole essay brings me back to the thought that censorship is basically conformism. The word conformism means to all become one; to conform. If this is the case no one will ever come up with new books, music, movies, magazines, or ideas; we will all just be citizens of @LOCATION1 or any other culture trapped inside our very own minds. Ultimately, censorship, while seemingly intended to protect, may actually hinder growth and understanding by limiting the perspectives available to us, leading to a society that lacks the richness of diverse thought.
52	3029	2	3	wow thats racist. as i said when i saw the movi white men cant jump. yes that movie could have afended me a lot but it didnt personaly i thought it was funny i enjoyed it cuase its true statistics say black people can jump higher then white people. its all on how you look at it you have to have a sense of humor when it comes to stuff like that. everyone remembers sometime when someone said something offensive to them. but its your choice to take that to heart or just laugh about it. life is so much easyer when u dont cry over every little thing that someone said to you. see now i have a since of humor. when i was in that movie i was laughing so hard i almost peed myself. i didnt care that it singled out white people so what its funny. to kill a mochinburd was also a book that a lot of people called offensive and i can see why. it had the @CAPS1 word in there a lot. but back then it was a different time the people in the book werent saying it to you so why would you be offended by it. he wasnt offending you. if you take little things like that to your heart then you will have a tough time going through life. somethings you just have to let go and roll off your body. in conclusion yes we have had a lot of offending stuff said to us but you cant let it get you down so much you have to move on. and if you move on you will be a better person in the long run. Ultimately, choosing how to react to potentially offensive content empowers us to navigate the world with resilience and understanding.
53	3030	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, and more are a good way to learn. Some of that material is bad though, but some is good. Not all people are the same, and not all books or magazines are the same. Books, newspapers, and magazines are good things, and they could be bad things. Some talk about nonfiction and some fiction. Others talk about famous people and all the good and mainly bad things they did this week, which is something some of us want to read but none of us should read or even write in the first place. Then there are books that have a childs story in them. There are also articles that everyone should read about, like somebody who saved a whole lot of people on @DATE1. There is a diverse amount of things to read out there, you just need to use a little discretion about what to read and put out on the shelves at a public library. Music is another good way to express yourself. There is good old fashioned @CAPS1 music such as @ORGANIZATION1. Then there is stuff that nobody should listen to, or for that matter even sing about like almost all @CAPS2 Music. They also have little childrens songs which no matter how annoying that most of it is, it's alright for anyone to listen to. Or you can pick up some good ol' @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or any other christian artists or gospel music.The music of this world is very diverse. The movies of today can, but most of the time aren't,be good things. You could pick up an educational video that talks about animals that most everyone could watch. There are also bad movies such as @CAPS5 and @CAPS6.It is a horror movie that made it hard to fall asleep for a few days. Those are some that nobody should even produce.There are video copies of television shows as well, which can be alright. The vast amount of movies made today should not even be a thought in someones mind but some are good and educational. So in conclusion, I think it should be reader and viewer discretion when it comes to content of things as this. Libraries everywhere should have most everything there is.Next time your in a library, just use discretion.  Books, music, movies, magazines, and more are a good way to learn. Some of that material is bad though, but some is good. Not all people are the same, and not all books or magazines are the same. Books, newspapers, and magazines are good things, and they could be bad things. Some talk about nonfiction and some fiction.

Then there are books that have a childs story in them. There are also articles that everyone should read about, like somebody who saved a whole lot of people on @DATE1, such as July 4th. There is a diverse amount of things to read out there, you just need to use a little discretion about what to read and put out on the shelves at a public library. Music is another good way to express yourself. There is good old fashioned @CAPS1 music such as @ORGANIZATION1, like classical music such as The Beatles. Then there is stuff that nobody should listen to, or for that matter even sing about like almost all @CAPS2 Music, like Rap Music. They also have little childrens songs which no matter how annoying that most of it is, it's alright for anyone to listen to. Or you can pick up some good ol' @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or any other christian artists or gospel music, such as gospel singers and bands. The music of this world is very diverse. The movies of today can, but most of the time aren't, be good things. You could pick up an educational video that talks about animals that most everyone could watch. There are also bad movies such as @CAPS5 and @CAPS6; for example, Friday the 13th and Halloween. It is a horror movie that made it hard to fall asleep for a few days. Those are some that nobody should even produce. There are video copies of television shows as well, which can be alright. The vast amount of movies made today should not even be a thought in someones mind but some are good and educational. So in conclusion, I think it should be reader and viewer discretion when it comes to content of things as this. Libraries everywhere should have most everything there is, with a responsible approach to collection development. Next time your in a library, just use discretion and choose wisely.
54	3031	2	3	Every library has tons of information on just about everything. There are tons of books, music, movies, magazines and more that contain this information. There is even some information that some people might take offence to. On the other hand, somebody else could be perfectly fine with it. I think that all libraries should keep all their books on the shelfs, no matter what kind of content they contain, because not everybody takes offence to some contents in books, and it is the same way vice versa. The removal of books limits access to diverse perspectives and historical records.  The subject race might come into play in some books in libraries. Books have information about people doing things to other people just because of their race. Some people want books took out of their libraries because of the content that they contain, but really it could be an important part of history that people need to be educated about. Some books have words that are very offencive to people because of their skin color, relgion, or ethnic race. This information that people need to know because thats how people were treated back then and some stuff like that still occurs today. Understanding the past, even its darkest chapters, is crucial for preventing future injustices.  Libraries have all kinds of information. I think that all the books at libraries should stay there no matter what they contain. Even if some content is offensive to some people it could still be an important part of history that people need to know, so libraries should maintain their role as inclusive repositories of knowledge.
55	3032	2	3	In my opinion, books, movies, magazines, etc., should not be taken off the shelves if they are offensive to some people. This is because everyone has different views on everything. Another reason is because of learning purposes in schools and etc. As well as authors would not want to be writing books because the book shelves are empty and their books, movies, magazines are getting rejected. Since most people have different views on everything then, every book or magazine would be taken off the shelf if they were offensive because, therefore, there would not be any book or magazine left on the shelf. This is because people think different things are offensive so what somebody thinks is offensive might not be to another person. Therefore people would be angered or upset if their favorite book was taken off the shelf because someone said it was offensive. Another problem with taking 'offensive' books of the shelf is that it would result in people not learning in schools and etc. This is because we all have to go through some point in school where we find something offensive for example wars, slavery, and politics. If all these books were to be taken off the shelves then nobody would be learning about any of this. In conclusion nobody would be being taught why these events happened and why these events are wrong, so people would not have changed, they would keep doing these things because they were not taught not to. This in my opinion would cause a lot of conflict between people and nobody would be educated on these events of history. On the other hand rather than books being taken off the shelf books would not be being put on the shelves. In this I mean that authors, producers, would not be making movies or writing books because their work just keeps getting rejected. Not only rejected but nobody is going to go through the time and effort to make one of these for it to be rejected because it was offensive. In my opinion it would almost be impossible for these authors/ directors to make an unoffensive book or movie for everyone that is going to read or watch it. To clarify, censorship would greatly hinder the creative process. In conclusion I have read many books in class every year that offends at least one person, but this person can choose not to finish the movie, book, or magazine if they find it offensive, or they never have to read it again. In conclusion there are many reasons why books should stay on the shelf even if they are offensive to someone. This is because it would not help with people being educated on events that happened, and people would not be reading any books in school, ultimately limiting their exposure to different perspectives. As well as authors would not be writing since their books are getting removed and the shelves are empty.
56	3033	2	3	"We should be more careful about what we find at the library because libraries contain books filled with knowledge, fun, romance, action, and adventure, but some can be disturbing and gruesome. Kids sometimes pick books with pornography or gruesome action, leading them to act differently. They may become hyper and mean, sneaky, and do things behind their parents' backs because they think it's ""cool,"" not understanding that it makes them look bad. Some parents suggest removing these books. However, if we remove all potentially harmful books, very few would remain because many contain something potentially detrimental. Therefore, we need to be more careful about the books we include and exclude from libraries, as this rapidly changes the world.  Libraries are great places for kids to learn, teaching them new things and expanding their knowledge. Kids doing reports or essays on important figures often visit the library, and others simply seek enjoyable books. Libraries are fantastic because books unleash our imaginations, taking us on adventures we might never experience otherwise.  However, books can sometimes cause family problems, nightmares, or bad behavior. Removing some of these books might bring families together. But not removing them could lead to chaos as people, especially kids, believe they need these books to survive, when it's the books and media that cause our minds to picture things we think we need.  Other writing materials and movies also cause problems. Magazines might feature scantily clad girls, and movies present images directly, which can negatively affect young minds. Not all magazines and movies are bad; they can be helpful. Magazines provide research and current event information, covering cooking, decorating, and weddings. Movies aid research and depict historical events through documentaries. We don't need to remove everything, but we can eliminate some.  Being careful about library content is crucial because it can cause bad behavior or nightmares. To solve this, we can remove books, magazines, and movies harmful to our minds, helping children grow up well-behaved and mature. Books, magazines, and movies can be beneficial if used correctly, and we can choose suitable books by following our hearts and instincts, ensuring we are equipped with the best material for growth and enrichment."
57	3034	2	3	Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This quote is reflecting people wanting to rid of some of the literature, books, magazines, music, and movies in libraries, because they think that the material is inappropriate. If we got rid of all of the books from this world, we would have nothing left to learn from, and some of the main sources of entertainment would vanish. I believe that certain materials should not be replaced from the shelves, because the youth of today need to learn about the true past, people should learn about how cultures really are, authors and writers need to be able to express themselves, and parents should be able to control what they believe their children should and should not read.  If it were not for books and novels from the past, the current generations would have no clue of what history was about. Children should be allowed to read books such as NAACP, The Great Gatsby, and To Kill a Mockingbird in order to get a taste of how much times have changed. Stories from grandparents only take a person back about 70 years; we need sources that can take us back thousands of years. Some families, such as an African American family, might get offended if their children are reading books that say things like 'nigger,' but that is our history. It is something we cannot change, and it is important for kids to know how things really were and how terrible people were treated. We also do not want today's youth making some of the terrible mistakes generations in the past made, so they need to be taught about the real but sometimes horrendous situations.  Learning about different cultures would be another issue if books and movies were depleted. Money is not available these days to just travel to different countries and experience their culture. How is a young girl from a small town in Alabama supposed to find out how people in Japan live their life? For all she knows, the people could be living in igloos. I believe that it is important for people to understand different cultures and religions in order to accept them in society. Movies can teach a lot about different countries, and books do a wonderful job as well. If they are gone, cultures would be misunderstood and forgotten.  Also, authors and directors need to be able to express themselves. Every since people are young, they are taught that it is important to be unique and express their own style. Not every writer is going to want to write about butterflies and rainbows. There are people that love writing about violence, gore, and segregation. Those things are part of the world today and everyone needs to face that reality. Getting rid of all of those books from library shelves will not solve the problems; it would only cause people to not expect what might happen to them or this world.  Now, some parents may have hard times when their young boy comes home from school with an offensive book, but parents should have control over their kids. If they have a problem with what their children are reading, then they should deal with that personally. They do not need to influence other people's lives by trying to get rid of the materials off of public libraries' shelves.  Why people would even consider getting rid of history and learning materials about cultures and different subjects in this world is beyond me. It would be like asking someone to rewind time so that we would not have had slavery, depressions, world wars, and homicides. It is impossible to undo history, but we can learn about the things from the past in order to not make the same mistakes and things of the current world in order to be accepting and understanding. Books, magazines, movies, and music are wonderful. They represent self-expression and freedom of speech, so people should let them be an entertainment and learning source, enriching our lives with knowledge and diverse perspectives. Without them, we would be and have nothing.
58	3035	2	3	Many people think that offensive material should be removed from the library because children could pick them up and look in them. I do not believe this should be done. Libraries already have a children's section; if a child looks in an inappropriate book outside of the children's section, then it's their fault. I do not think it should inconvenience someone to have to go elsewhere to get that CD, game, book, or movie they were looking for. It is very hard to come across an inappropriate book without looking for it on purpose. It could be a book used for teaching health or a nursing class and is not meant to be inappropriate at all. These are a few things you should consider when choosing a side on this debate, including the challenges of censorship and access. These factors should be thoughtfully considered, especially since we might have to vote on it someday, as removing materials would negatively affect everyone.
59	3036	2	3	Who cares about unsensored things anyway? Offensive things have been around in libraries, probably since the first library opened. There has been 'offensive' things in a library for as long as i can remember. Now everyone is suppose to share there opinions on pulling these offensive books off the shelve? What is the difference between someone saying something offensive or writing it? Ok, so maybe you dont want your child reading something unsensored, but the chances are some other child will say something unsensored around him. If there is a book that is so bad you wouldnt want your kids reading, why would it of been published? Publishers do read the books they publish, they will not publish any random thing. There are editorial standards and market considerations that guide their choices.  I think that they just need to leave the unsensored things alone. If you cant be mature enough to take a article, book, or magazine seriously, then you dont need to be reading it anyway. In the news or radio you always hear about some boy getting bullied and stuff at school. That isnt because of unsensored things, why dont they blame it on parents and ask where they were at? Parents look at anyone and everyone, but themselves when a kid comes home and has learned a cuss word or something. It is never the parents fault. Instead of focusing on external factors, perhaps the focus should be on parental guidance and open communication within families.  If people pull unsensored things out of the library it will serve no purpose and thats just my opinion. I know that i have no say in it and thats ok i can still believe that i am right. It's a matter of intellectual freedom and individual responsibility, and removing such materials would not address the root causes of the issues people are concerned about; therefore, censorship is not the answer. Thank you for your time
60	3037	2	3	When you were a child how much did you learn from books? Books are filled with great stories of far-away lands, accounts of real events, and poems with powerful meanings. All of those books were written by an author with a clear point to make. Those books should not be censored from libraries because of words or ideas that are found offensive. Children have to learn these things some time in their life and I think the earlier they learn the less trouble it will cause them later in life. There are also freedoms in the United States that grant us freedom of speech. Shouldn't there be a freedom to read as well? Authors are brilliant people. Without them, there would be no books for anybody to read. We should all respect authors and what they put into their books. This means when an author believes that a certain word or action fits in a book, we should leave that book alone and respect what the he or she chose to put in it. When I was a child I picked up on everything. I was a very inquisive as any kid my age would be. I remember wandering around my public library scanning the rows of books and reading the titles. There were books about politics, religion, sex, and violence. However on the other side of the library, there were books about children escaping their own world and traveling through time in a magical tree house. There were even stories about mice who had feelings and normal conversations amongst themselves! The library is great because of the plethora of knowledge contained in the unrestricted inventory of books. As I grew older, I began to dwelve into more adult books such as politics and religion. I then formed my own personal opinions on what I gathered from the books. Without those books in that library I would have never been able to research those topics. There is an amendment in our Constitution of America that promotes freedom of speech in the United States. This allows for anybody to say whatever they please as long as they don't infringe upon the rights of anybody else. The definition of library is a place where people can read and check out books from library and return them when they please. Libraries should allow every book in their collection because every book has some sort of value. Taking a book out of a library because of offensive material is not right because books are important no matter what is inside of them. Some books sometimes have material that might not belong in the hands of children. Children need to learn those things sometime in their life. Why not now? Books are what have taught all of us, so please let them keep teaching.
61	3038	2	3	Offensive books should not be completely removed from circulation. Instead, they should be placed in sections specifically designated for adult readers. This ensures that children are not exposed to potentially harmful content. However, if an offensive book is located in a setting primarily frequented by children, such as a school library, removing it from the shelves is acceptable. Ultimately, removing an offensive book is justifiable only when the book's content is inappropriate for its intended audience, safeguarding younger readers while still preserving access for adults.
62	3039	2	3	I think that everyone's opinion is different about some books getting removed from the library. Do I believe that certain books should be removed from the library: yes and no. The reason why I choose yes and no is because some books are helpful to others for their class and their research for whatever class they need it for. Another reason why I say no is because of the fact, if the book offends you then don't read the book or think about what it says, just leave it alone. The other reason why I picked yes is because if it shows some hurtful words in there towards others that's referring to the people that it's talking about then yes it needs to be removed before others start using those kinds of hurtful words to their peers or their elders. If the book contains racial slurs to different races then yes they need to be removed asap to prevent misuse. If others get ahold of these kinda books then everyone would use them against each other which in result of that would cause an outbreak of fights, people arguing with each other, just pure hate between those people using it against the different races. Therefore, my stance reflects a balance between protecting access to information and preventing the spread of hate. These are my opinions of removing some books that contains hurtful things or meaning in them that can contain violence in them or call another person out of their name or race.
63	3040	2	3	Should censorship be used on library books? Obviously, if you are talking to an adult then yes, more than likely they don't want their pupils to be learning inappropriate words, but if you ask any student the same question you will probably get mixed answers. Some might say' I don't appreciate hearing or reading those words,' others might say' sure why not, I hear them on television, see them on the internet, my parents say them so why can't I read them.' To me personally I don't think it's that big of a deal to have a few inappropriate words in a book, but they shouldn't be allowed on shelves in a middle school's library or lower. High school and up I think that its okay to have on the shelves in magazines, books, music and movies. When I was a child my mother always said don't cuss, but growing up in an environment where the overwhelming majority of people you talk to cuss, then after awhile it comes out like normal words. So why not have it in the books, and movies? It's not like we don't know what the words mean. If they hurt your feelings then you know not to read, listen or watch it again. I'm not saying cuss words are good and that it's ok for them to be in every sentence you say, but hearing or reading a few won't kill you. In some cases, cuss words are good for a story. Sometimes you're reading a book and someone gets in an argument, you don't even realize it till the argument is over, but sometimes when there is a cuss word, you stop and say,' something is going on here, and I want to know what it is.' It catches your attention and keeps you hooked on whatever it is until you find out what happened. Consequently; movies, books, music, and magazines with foul language do have an affect on our youth. A lot of children are cussing at an early age, but that's just how people communicate, show emotions, and get someone's attention. Censorship can take away a lot from a book, overall making it less interesting, so again I believe censorship should not be a deciding factor in choosing a book, movie, music or magazine; instead, we should choose them because they look interesting and are something we might enjoy, allowing for a more authentic experience.
64	3041	2	3	There are many books that are offensive to people, and I personally agree. There are many things that shouldn't be seen by children. There is a lot of material out there, whether it's books, movies, or other things, that have bad influences on children. Children learn by watching and observing; they learn from us and our generation. What better way to protect them than by removing these bad influences? First, children watch movies and see people kissing, and one thing leads to another. Some movies even show people having sex. What kind of influence is that on the children? Then the children learn and go out there and do the same thing. Teen pregnancies have jumped through the roof. High schools are filled with pregnant teens. Anywhere you go, I guarantee you will see a pregnant teen. Some girls even get pregnant right after they have developed and are able to have kids. Now imagine if we were able to stop that. There's a way: don't let the children watch these programs, that way they won't be tempted. Secondly, there are books and movies and other things that show the children shooting and killings and how people get away with it. This could be a very bad influence. There are video games with shootings and have limbs flying all over the place. Well, the children will learn from those video games and movies. They think that killing someone is okay and you can get away with it. Bad influences like that make the children think it's okay to do things like that. There have been children who have killed their parents for a video game. Then the children become serial killers or go on a shooting spree at school. Isn't that much evidence at all to show people that something is wrong? We need to take immediate control of this situation and stop it before one day you see your child on television for killing someone. Finally, all the children are getting lazier. All children do is lie down and watch TV or play video games. Their laziness causes obesity. There are many kids to whom this topic refers to. No parent wants to see their kid overweight for many reasons. Children being obese causes lots of depression. The child feels sad because they feel ugly and they lose self-esteem. The child then becomes shy and quiet. In some cases, the child tries to commit suicide because other children are teasing them in school every day. I know any parent wouldn't want their kid to die. These are things that are happening and parents need to open their eyes and see what's happening before it's too late. In conclusion, to prevent all these catastrophes, there has to be change. There are many harmful and bad influences out there today that can determine the children's futures. There's still time for change, so let's do something about it. Let's try to reduce teen pregnancies, bad influential video games or movies, and instead of watching movies and playing video games all day, get up, go outside, and go for a walk, as these are little things we can do to make a change for good, thus securing a brighter future for our children.
65	3042	2	3	I think that books should not be censored. There are no books, besides maybe math books, that don't offend at least one person or a group of people. Books are an important part of the learning system. If a certain book offends you then you have to deal with it. It's that simple. There is no need to overreact to words on paper. Besides there are more important issues at the moment. While being offended by a book is bad, we must realize that some people are going through things that are way worse than that. People who do drugs or have a family member that does drugs are an example. A better example would be the parents or guardians of a kid who was killed either by accident or on purpose. One of the most common but overlooked examples is the what the loved ones of people who die serving our country go through. As you can see if people can live with that then we can definitely handle an offensive book. Censorship causes blindness. What I mean is, if we censor one offensive book then we have to censor every book that someone finds offensive. All men are created equal, right? So they'd have to censor the book. If a book offends you that much then listen up, you have to deal with it! Just because a book is offensive to you that doesn't mean it's offensive to everyone. Sometimes a history book could be considered offensive so we censor it and then we don't learn about the mistakes of our past and repeat them. The point is if a person can handle some of the things I've mentioned, then we can all handle a little bit of words on a little bit of paper, so banning books is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
66	3043	2	3	This is what's wrong with today's society. We are too soft. We're too worried about what other people might think if we say this or do that. I'm the kind of person that doesn't care about other people's feelings, and I say that to an extent. If we're talking about my friends, family, my girlfriend, that's totally different. I show a lot of respect to those people on a daily basis. But as far as people I don't know, I could care less what their beliefs, opinions, and outlooks on life are. Maybe we should stop worrying about other people for once and just try to grow and prosper as a race. Anybody ever think of that? If I had it my way, the government would not exist. News, radio, books, movies, magazines would all be uncensored. Is life filtered and censored? Absolutely not! So why should those things be? I'm sick and tired of people constantly sheltering their children from life's normalcies. They've gotta learn sometime. Life isn't lollipops and rainbows. It's hard, unforgiving, and it kicks you in the teeth. You've just got to learn to adapt to it. And censorship in libraries, on news outlets etc, won't and aren't helping matters in the least bit. I guess I don't understand why we have to care so much. If everybody just relaxed a little and focused on themselves, we would be fine. Every time I hear the word 'offensive' it makes me sick to my stomach, because in my eyes, that word doesn't exist. It's a made-up word that really means we care about other people's feelings more than we do our own, which ultimately hinders progress.
67	3044	2	3	"I don't believe in censorship of libraries. Here in America, we live in a free country and have the right to have access to the material we want from libraries. It doesn't matter if it's age-appropriate or not. If you don't want your kids listening to that bad rap artist, or watching that R-rated movie, then it's your responsibility as a parent to keep it from them. Part of what makes the United States so great is the freedom that comes with living here. If we allowed anyone to censor a library then we would have no books to read, movies to watch, or music to listen to. Katherine Paterson said, ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" This quote shows that if anyone had the right to pull a book from the shelf we wouldn't have any books left. Censorship would just be the start. It could lead to the government censoring information from the public that they don't want us to know, which would take away the greatness of the United States; we wouldn't be free. Censorship of libraries would take away our rights, which is why I oppose it."
68	3045	2	3	Should books, magazines, music, movies, and ect. be censored for certin age levels? No they shouldn't. Books can be very educational. Sometimes you can't even find a book without bad things in them. Even if they do, sometimes it's the only way to learn some of the rich history of our country. Books can't be censored from children. Why you ask? Because the reason people read books is to learn. To learn about love, math, history, and much more. These books are written by adults, not for adults, but for everyone to read. I read lots of books, and every book that I read I learn something new.  Back in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, cursing was huge in books. But it wasn't just to curse, it was to show the full dialogue of the character. It also set the mood of the era, and the place, where the story is being held. Such as in war books the characters curse a lot. The reason for this is that if a man gets shot in the leg and all he said was,' @CAPS1!!' That isn't how the character would act. The man would curse his lungs out. Not literally but when the author writes what someone would truly say, the reader will have a better understanding of the characters in the book.  As the quote says, everyone has the same right to read, which is true. It's true because everyone has a right to be interested and learn about what they are interested in. Right? I myself strongly believe they everyone should choose what they want to learn about, and then have the freedom to do that. The freedom to explore different perspectives and ideas is essential for personal growth and intellectual development.  So should books in a library be censored? No definitely not. It's the best way for people to learn what life is really like. Sometimes you can't learn anything without reading a book with curse words, sex, or violence. People worry that reading books like this will create bad people if they learn these things at a younger age. But it won't, it will only show them how not to act and can only create a better person. Exposure to diverse content, even if challenging, allows individuals to develop their own moral compass and critical thinking skills. Therefore, unrestricted access to books is crucial for fostering a well-rounded and informed society.
69	3046	2	3	I believe if books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. are offensive and bad, they should be removed, because of younger children. Younger children are not allowed to be exposed to that stuff if it's bad or not pertinent to them. Since there are books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. that are bad and offensive, then I would suggest a room or some sort of place where they can be held and where only adults can be around them and can get to them. Movies and magazines are my biggest worry. There are more bad things in them than in books or music. Books and music have bad language but very rarely have bad images or other things like that. If there happens to be a book, music, movie, or magazine that you or any other person thinks is inappropriate or offensive, then you or that person would have permission to take it off and show it to the main desk, and let them know what you think about it. This would allow for a review process.  I feel that they should separate the censorship in libraries to keep the children safe. Adults should still be allowed to have access to these books, music, movies, and magazines because adults can handle that kind of material, whereas younger children can't. So, therefore, to keep everything separate, and there shouldn't be a problem, a clear distinction between adult and children's materials is needed, ensuring a safe environment for kids while still respecting adult access.
70	3047	2	3	Many people are very stern about there thoughts when they believe in something very strongly. In other peoples eyes you @MONTH1 find some who disagree and do agree with you from having similar life experiences. All of which peoples opinions are created by life experiences and many tragedy' they have been apart of. You will find sooner or later that some of the problems that many people deal with, that there is someone who has a lot worse than you do and that you should enjoy every moment you can. Opinions are alternated often about many different things, being a homosexual is one of the many that people debate about most often. In my opinion it doesn't really matter whether your homosexual or not you have to understand that everyone is different in there own way. Exceptence is what' key to making eveyone get along at some point, but people struggle with homophobia. Another big debate that many people have are with female and male opinions. It seems as if they dont get along because they disagree, but neither could live without each other. It's nearly impossible to find a male or female who agree' with you @PERCENT1, unless there pretending to be something there not. From life experiences from parents arguing, friends fighting, and other relatives you see people forgive and forget so easily because the world is supposed to gifted and cherished everyday. All in all I believe that most books are based off of reality and other peoples visions on the world and what they see. I also find it interesting when people are very dramatic when trying to get there point across. It helps others get a clear picture of who and what they go through, showcasing perspectives on life, love, and acceptance, and how these elements shape our interactions and understanding of one another.
71	3048	2	3	I believe that all the books are meant to be in the library. People would not want them gone if they thought of it the way I do. It makes sense that we need all sorts of books to learn from. Some books @MONTH1 seem bad, but when you think about it there is always a good lesson to be learned. There are many different reasons why all books should stay on the shelf, but here are a couple of mine. Two years ago there was a boy named @PERSON1. On many occations he found himself in bad situations that he did not know how to deal with. Many parents do not talk to their kids about certain things, such as drugs. This makes kids unaware and curious to figure out the truth. He had no other way of figuring out about how to handle fights, drugs, and alcohol unless he read about them in a book. When he was almost sixteen years old he began to hang out with a bad group of teenagers. They were going to take @PERSON1 to a party. @PERSON1 secretly left his house and went because he was curious. When he got to the party, everybody began to drink. He knew that he always wanted to try it, yet he was not going to because he had to be home before his parents got up at five the next morning. After several hours of setting on a couch watching everybody else do it, they finally had him talked into it. He figured that one would not hurt. Well before long, one became two, two became four, and it just kept going up. @PERSON1 was having so much fun that he lost track of time. He looked at the clock and it was three a.m., he got really worried. He didn't know what to do until he thought back to a book he read. The book was about a guy who was out drinking, the guy had know other way home than to drive. The guy decided he would just drive home because he was not very drunk. When he was driving home he pulled out on a highway at the wrong time. A semi hit him in the left side of his car. After thinking about that book he decided to be brave and call his parents. @PERSON1 knew that he would get punished, but he decided that grounding would be better than injury, or even death. @PERSON1 had his dad come get him from the party. He was grounded for two months. It would have been longer if his parents had not been so proud of his decision in the end. @PERSON1 was happy with his decision as well. Events such as that are the exact reason why I think that almost any book belongs on the shelf. The story in each book helps everybody comprehend what should be done in a real life situations. I know that books help me figure out many things, even what to do and what not to do in various situations. If you just give every book a chance, you will find a good reason for it to be read and learn from.
72	3049	2	3	Yes, I think certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive to some or the majority of people. Some can be a bad influence on younger kids, while others can be offensive to someone's race or religion, or even to people based on who they are or what they do.  Some materials should be removed because of the kind of influence they have on younger kids. Certain books can have violent language and actions. Many magazines contain inappropriate articles that children should not be reading or even looking at. Today's music is often very explicit and does not need to be in the hands of kids. Some parents may not be concerned about the music their kids listen to, but music is still one of the biggest influences. That's one reason why certain books, music, and magazines should be removed from shelves.  There are a lot of music and movies that are very offensive to certain races and religions. Hip hop is one of the most explicit kinds of music and is very offensive to many religions and some races. Movies can be the same as music. Magazines sometimes have racist articles or articles that are very offensive to certain religions.  A lot of magazines have stories about celebrities that are very bad, sad, and private. In the past, some celebrities have sued magazines and newspapers that published incorrect stories or something too private.  Those are just some ways and reasons why certain books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive; everyone has different sensitivities. No one knows how people feel about themselves or things around them, so removing offensive material can help foster a more respectful environment for everyone.
73	3050	2	3	NO, I don't think music, movies, magazines, and etc., should be moved from libraries because what's a library with only books? Even though you have to read and be quiet and be seated, you can have music while on the computer, and you can watch and check out movies you might like. And the magazines keep you updated with the newest fashion or new looks or something that's going on in our community. Music is what you want to listen to when you come to the library; it's smoothing up the vibe, and if you might be in a bad mood, that music you might like might calm you down and put you in a better one. It relaxes you. You can be on the computer and still listen to music. While reading a good book, you can be listening to music. Movies are a good source when in the library. You can watch movies while in the library and check some out and take home and watch. You can watch all types of movies, movies you might like, and it also can be movies you might need for a project or even educational movies. If you want to learn about nature, animals, or even a historical person from the past, it's always good to have a movie in the library. Magazines in a library are very helpful because while you might be waiting on something or on the computer, you can sit and grab a magazine. In the library, it's a variety of magazines you can read, like sports, fashion, nature, cartoons, animals, and etc. So magazines are very helpful in a library. That's why I say no; they shouldn't be removed from libraries because you can do lots of great things in the library besides just reading a book and getting on a computer. Movies, magazines, and music are helpful in a library too. Who just wants to get on a computer and read a book? That is why these resources should remain in libraries, providing a more diverse and engaging experience for everyone.
74	3051	2	3	The library is a pathway to knowledge, which branches to many different cultural roads. It has expanded from just a place of books to a building which also houses music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media. But, there begs the question if certain materials should be excluded if they deemed to be offensive. There are many ways to approach this question. Is censorship an answer to offensive materials or an answer to what is not 'politically correct'? Often, people will claim certain work to be unjust without understanding the viewpoint of the supposed victim. It is quite ironic that the people with the power - who stand up for offended parties - often do not understand them more than the creator of the work.  Another reason for censorship is to protect children from unwanted material, which is very understandable. But, where in the process do parents have control of what exactly they want their children to access? I believe it is the resposibility of the parent to determine such restrictions. If a parent gives a child unlimited access to material at a library, then the child should be able to explore wherever their curiosity takes them. If the parent chooses to limit access, then they should be active in the process of selection. It is the right of the individuals who birthed and raise these kids to determine how they are guided. Parents can use available resources like library staff recommendations or online reviews to help guide their children's choices.  I myself am a musician, which is no more artistic in a sense than any other creator, such as an author. My creations are expressions that I give for world to enjoy and think about. To remove the work of an author in a library is to damage his ability to spread his thoughts. Of course, there are other outlets to acquire books, but the library is one of the greatest outlets. Limiting an artist's reach through censorship restricts the potential for dialogue and understanding.  There are a couple complications that will arise in censorship on libraries. What guidlines do you have in determing excluding the offensive materials? If a material offends one person, is that sufficient enough to exclude it, or do you need a larger group? It is unrealistic to always get a complete consensus of a group's opinion, so how do you determine whats offensive and whats not. Establishing such guidelines could involve community input and a clear understanding of context.  In all, I believe that everybody should have the ability acquire whatever material they want from a library. It is an institution that is allows one to go places that they will never go and live lives they never will live. Its ability to do such should not be compromised, and access to diverse perspectives, even those considered offensive by some, is crucial for intellectual growth and societal progress.
75	3052	2	3	In third grade, I took a book off the shelf of my local library that had an interesting cover. It was rather large, but I had come to love reading in that time of my life so I decided I was up for it. The genre of the book was fantasy which I enjoyed immensly. Although, there were some parts of the book that had me confused. There were scenes involving women that I did not understand, and many new words. Eventually, I came to ask my dad about a certain part of the book. He read the passage, and his eyes went wide. I never finished that book. There is no doubt that I had a learning experience by reading that book, but, as my dad obviously thought, it might have been a little too much for that time in my life. If it were not for my mom not wanting to make a big deal out of it, my dad would have had a little chat with that library. Now that I am old enough to understand what was going on in that book, I realize that I lost some of my innocense because of it. There is simply some material that is not appropriate for children, and it should not be put in our public libraries. Not censoring what is put on the shelves seems obsurd considering my experience. If I have a son someday, I want to be the one telling him about the touchy subjects of women and swearing; it should not be from some fiction book. I also do not appreciate the other material found in our libraries. The music that I see has artists that write their songs without children in mind, movies have up to PG-13 ratings, and magazines promote gossip and have sexual references. Overall, it is disappointing to me that our libraries have allowed some of these things onto their shelves. As I think about my experience in third grade, I wish I had never seen that book. Maybe it would have allowed me to keep a little more innocense for a little bit longer, and maybe I would have respected women more through my youth. I would love to see more censorship in libraries so that we can protect today's children until the parents choose to open their eyes to the world.
76	3053	2	3	Have you ever noticed how much bad materials are out there for children to get ahold of? A movie, book, magazine, music, or even something on the internet? It would be nice to get rid of all that bad material, but what if someone else doesn't feel the same way about that song, movie, or internet show? I think it would be horrible if we took away all the bad materials because it might bring violence between some people who disagree on it, and it goes against one of our rights, freedom of speech. In the world we live in today, if you take something away from someone like their favorite book, it's going to bring out some violence between some people. Look back into our history, we are a country full of rebels. That is how America even came to be. So take away something from people they are going to stand up and fight for it. There will always be people trying to smuggle and hide some things, so we will never be able to get rid of it completely. If you take away all the bad materials it would be taking away one of our rights, freedom of speech. Some materials out there may be offensive to others, but it's not like we have a right to get rid of it. It's not like there is any book, magazine, or even a song out there that someone doesn't get offended by. If we do take away all the offensive materials we should take away everything. So what is the point we all will never all agree on something, we can't please everyone. In taking away all the offensive materials you are taking away people's right to freedom of speech. Don't try to take away all the offensive materials, it will just bring violence and make it all much worse than it was. If you're a parent it's not like you can shield your children from everything because eventually they will learn what it all is. So it won't do any good to try to get rid of it. It will still be around. It is just something in our world that we have to live with, and suppressing it could create more issues in the long run.
77	3054	2	3	I don't believe libraries should remove items some people find offensive. I don't personally find any items so offensive that I would want them removed from a library. The impact on the individual is a major problem that many people don't think about often before acting. Here are some situations many people run into: If one person finds a book offensive but no one else does, should the book be removed? Many libraries contemplate whether or not they should remove an offensive item due to some peoples' opinions. This is because they know people like the book and they know people don't; they wonder whether or not they should remove the item because a few people find the book offensive, (this can range from books, music, movies, magazines, etc.). People often think they do what is best for everyone by asking the library staff to remove something they think is offensive. Honestly, they're only helping the people that want to have the book removed and don't say anything, that is if the library removes the offensive item. If the library removes the offensive item, they will lose a customer, if they don't remove the item they will lose a customer. So they are faced with a dilemma, 'remove the item or don't remove the item?' It's a tough decision to make especially when they may lose more than a few customers based on either choice. So what do they do? They might poll the customers and see what they think, they might do nothing at all, or they might remove the item to keep the person happy. The problem is what happens if it's a friend who liked the item and you don't want to hurt their feelings because the item has been there forever and they love the book so much, but can't afford to buy the book at a store. What do you do then? People often don't want to think of other people's' feelings and/or the decisions they would have to face over something as small as 'an offensive' item, and they say things that they wouldn't normally say just to get said item 'out of their sight.' Ultimately, they just don't want to acknowledge other people's' choices, feelings, opinions, etc. So what would you do if you found an offensive item at the library? Would you ask for it to be removed? Say nothing? It is your choice in the end, but not all people have the same tastes in books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that you do. So think about other people's' possible feelings, thoughts, opinions in mind before making a decision. Therefore, while personal offense is valid, it shouldn't automatically dictate the removal of materials from libraries, as diverse perspectives and access to information are crucial for a well-rounded society.
78	3055	2	3	If I were offended by a book in the library, I wouldn't want it taken off the shelf. There's no point in removing it; many books offend people, and that one book isn't just directed towards me. The same goes for movies and music. Books should be able to be written about anything and everything that interests people. Some people might not find the same thing offensive as I do; everyone doesn't think alike. If books were made based on emotions or how people would perceive them, there wouldn't be as many books in the world today. This is a free country, and we have the right to speak and write about whatever we want to express.  Movies are another way of conveying emotions or expressing oneself. People find many movies offensive, but movies aren't made based on how people feel about them. We can express anything in movies. No one or no race is the center of attention in movies; some people may feel that they are, but that's a personal feeling.  Music can be produced, rapped, or sung in many ways to reach people. Music can be found offensive nowadays, but music is also a way of expressing emotions and freedom of speech. I've never felt offended by a song I've heard; people will say what they feel and want.  Freedom of speech goes a long way in the world; people either have to get used to it or stay offended. Books, music, movies, or magazines won't be pulled because of emotions. I see it as a form of artistic expression that shows how people think and respond to things, and censorship would limit this important dialogue.
79	3056	2	3	Many books and materials in libraries are sometimes offensive to certain people, but that does not mean they should be taken off the shelves. Material that might be offensive to one person might have a valuable interest to another person. If you hated the subject of history and had the right to take it away, then someone else might come along and take away a subject you like, such as science. Instead of complete removal, if material is offensive to the general public, it should be placed in a special section, be available behind the counter, or available only at specific libraries. Throughout the libraries of the world, there are general sections like adult, kid, and entertainment sections. In these sections, many topics and many views of certain things are located, and sometimes offensive content is almost 'hidden' from view, requiring extensive searching. Controversial topics should be kept in a closed-off section of the library and can be accessed by the staff so that none of the public need worry. Like cigarettes at a store, some things should be behind the counter where the material can have a watchful eye over it. These subjects include sex, racism, porn, politics, and other material like the ones listed. With these items behind the counter, people will not know about it and it will be hidden from view, but still accessible with special order or request, which would help the public. Some material, when reaching a specific town, can cause an uproar that can shake an entire community. Some material should be denied from entering small towns, and the specified material can only be acquired at large libraries or specific bookstores. With material far away, people can be reassured in small towns that material will never upset their community. This is why some material should only have permitted access under watchful guard, ultimately balancing access with community sensitivities.
80	3057	2	3	I do not think that they should be taken off of the shelf because some people find it offensive. The way I look at it is that everyone has their own beliefs and rights, their own opinions. Not everyone is going to think alike, and catering to every individual sensitivity is simply not feasible. As an example, some people are against blacks, and others are not. Everyone thinks differently and has their own opinions; therefore, they should all be able to listen to whatever material they choose. Not everyone is going to like what you like and listen and believe everything you do. Don't read it if it offends you, but just because it offends you doesn't mean that someone else out there doesn't believe in it or likes it. Removing content based solely on offense infringes on the rights of others who may value it, and it is better to allow individual choice to prevail.
81	3058	2	3	All throughout the world there are libraries. Librairies have all different kinds of materiel stacked upon shelves. Most of the material is helpful and enjoyable but some is not. I think libraries should be able to have whatever they want on their shelves. Yes, i understand some of this material @MONTH1 be inappropriate for a certain person but there is a way you can fix this. If libraries have inappropriate books, movies, music, ect. I think they should be able to keep them. Just because some people do not that material does not mean everyone won't like it. Everyone has their own style, everyone likes different things and has different opinions. Isn't that what makes the world go around? Adults @MONTH1 have a problem with the offensive material because they have children who go to the library. I understand there concern but there can be a way to stop them from getting to the inappropriate material. If libraries are going to have this kind of stuff in their libraries i think there should be a blocked off room where kids can't go. That way the people who like that kind of stuff can still get to it but the children can not. We go to school for a vast amount of reasons. Some being; to learn, to get us ready for college, and to be independent. While we are at school not only are we learing things like math and evolution, but we are also learing whats going on in the world around us. If you haven't noticed, all that is out there anymore is bullying, cursing songs and horrifying movies. We, as children and teenagers see and hear about this everyday. Since we learn and already know about all of this 'offensive' stuff, why not have it in our libraries for other people who want to study it? There is alot of different kinds of material in libraries. Some good for kids and teenagers and some inappropriate. I understand the concern for parents on censorship in public libraries, but there is a way to stop it. I think as long as its blocked off into a different room, everyone will be fine and it will cause no harm, so long as the library takes steps to clearly designate and separate materials deemed inappropriate for children, thus addressing parental concerns while preserving intellectual freedom.
82	3059	2	3	Censorship is the idea of blocking or removing things that are offensive to peoples belief's, their religion, their race and just their ways of life. Therefore, i do not belive that books in libraries should be censored. I understand that things that people write can be offensive to yourself or others, but what if you found a book that was descriminating someone elses belief's but not yours. Would that still be okay with you to take those book off of the shelves? Also, taking books out of a library is not going to stop kids from learning about things that are not age approprite. If you do not want your child learning about them do not let them get it. You censor what your child reads and do not punish the people who go into the library and need the book. There would be no more libraries if people really wanted to start taking books off the shelf for being offensive. Some people in this world would just take the matter too far and get offended by everything. The things that people will read in books or magazines and see in movies is nothing compared to what they will see in the real world. So if anything, the books that might be offensive to people only show you that you will not like everything that someone writes or says. As far as movies, they are already rated on a decent scale. If it is not age approprite, then do not watch it, or let your children. The same applys for video games and music. Censor them from your children, and do not get them censored from the whole world. That is my opinion about censoring things from libraries. Just because you do not agree with every little thing that someone writes, does not mean that someone else in the world does not. Out of all the things that need to be censored the library is not one of them. Of all the places, taking things off of the library shelves is not going to do justice of what really needs to be done, and it's a disservice to the diverse perspectives a library should offer.
83	3060	2	3	Certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive for three reasons. The first reason being that what may be offensive to you may not be to someone else. The next reason being that the thing being called offensive can help teach others. The last reason being if we all just removed things we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is. The first reason is that what may be offensive to you may not be to someone else. In this society we live in we shouldn't go based on one's opinion because everybody has a right to freedom of speech. History shows that many different people find different things to be offensive because some people think that books that have gays shouldn't be in books, but many feel otherwise. That is a good example on how people have different opinions. The next reason being that the thing being called offensive can help teach others about many different things. Libraries being a place to study and learn should have a busload of different things even if some take offense to it. In fact, some books teach us that we shouldn't get offensive because that's what one person feels and as long as you've got someone who loves you it doesn't matter. The last reason being if we all just removed things we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is. Books are a way for someone to give their own point of view, if you dislike it don't take offense to it and try to remove it from the shelves. The government has a government where they take everybody's opinion. A prime example of this is the state funding schools which is a big issue, we shouldn't just remove the school because someone doesn't like it. In conclusion certain materials shouldn't be removed from shelves if they're found offensive for three reasons. The first reason being if you found something offensive it may not be to someone else. The next reason being that the thing being called offensive can help teach others about many different things. The last reason being if we all just removed things we dislike the world wouldn't be the way it is, and we would lose valuable perspectives and opportunities for growth.
84	3061	2	3	Dear Katherine Paterson, Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed form the shelves if they are found offensive? I honestly don't think that's necessary because not everybody will find those materials offensive. If a couple people think that a certain book or something is offensive then don't read it or pay attention to it, don't take something from someone that they like. I think that if there were people that found a certain topic interesting and there was also people who found it offensive, that they should keep the material and the people who dislike it would just have to get over it. Either way I think that they shouldn't remove those materials, unless everyone agrees that it's offensive. That's not fair to everyone else who likes that topic, just because one person found it offensive. Now if a magazine for the public is being racist or something like that then maybe that can be considered being removed, but other than that I see no reason why you should take away something that some people enjoy. Let's say I enjoy movies, books, or magazines about hunting and people find it offensive to kill animals for the fun of it or for food. Just because that single person doesn't like that certain thing doesn't mean they should take it away from everyone else. That's just their opinion on things and you can't always get what you want, so just deal with it. Well those are my thoughts on rather or not you should remove materials that some people find offensive. My last opinion is if you don't like the material and it offends you don't read it or have anything to do with it. Other than that you shouldn't take materials away from people unless everyone agrees on it, because ultimately, individual choice and tolerance should prevail in determining what one consumes. Sincerely, [Name]
85	3062	2	3	Many people have different opinions about what's appropriate and what's not. It depends on one's beliefs and morals. I personally don't think that there should be any censorship in libraries. I think that people should have the freedom to choose what to read, watch, or listen to. Each person should be able to make a decision depending on what they believe. It also depends on a person's age and maturity level. Some parents let their kids watch certain movies that maybe other parents wouldn't. The situation is different for each person.  It's hard to judge certain materials because some people might find it acceptable while others might not. There would be controversy over virtually everything because everybody has different standards of what's acceptable what's not, and these standards would clash with each other. It would be impossible to make sure that nothing in libraries would be offensive to people. If someone finds something offensive, then they don't have to check it out.  I also think that there are some things that can be done to help appease the argument. For example materials can be categorized by maturity level. That's what movie ratings are for. Materials should be organized that people can easily see if they would be offensive or not. For example all the kids movies and books can be put together so that way parents don't have to worry about their kids seeing or reading something that would be inappropriate. It should be obvious to people who would find it offensive and who wouldn't.  People should have the individual freedom to make decisions for themselves. A library is a public place for anybody to go check out anything they want. Just because somebody finds a book offensive, that doesn't mean that nobody should be allowed to read it. That being said, certain things can be done so that people would know if something would be offensive or not, allowing them to make informed choices.
86	3063	2	3	If I poured my heart into a story about my life, and someone deemed it offensive enough to remove it from shelves, I would feel deeply hurt and silenced. The censorship in libraries is becoming a controversial problem because it infringes on freedoms, ignores diverse perspectives, and hinders awareness of dangers. One important aspect of this controversy is how censorship takes away our freedom of speech. In America, we have the right to speak our minds. If everything we read was censored, there would be little left to read. The liberties and freedoms of American citizens should not be taken away based on subjective notions of what is deemed inappropriate. Another reason why censorship is wrong is that different people have completely different opinions. One person might find a book about a sexual assault victim offensive, while another might see it as informational and helpful. Censorship cannot be based on a single belief, as it will never be universally approved. A third reason to limit censorship is that it reduces awareness of real-life dangers. Stories about kidnapping or drunk driving accidents can be beneficial. Even though the story may have some disturbing details, it could be very influential, and convince someone to make the right choice. If we censor stories about abduction, drugs, alcohol, or bad decisions, people lose the chance to learn from others' mistakes and make better choices themselves. Although stories or magazine articles that may be seen as vulgar are often frowned upon, they are instrumental in raising awareness, upholding freedom of speech, and respecting diverse opinions. Censorship in libraries and media should be abolished so that the freedom to create and read is not taken away.
87	3064	2	3	I actually do believe that they should be able to be removed from the shelf. On the other hand i do not believe that anything racist should be on library shelfs. Teens these days want to be able to pick up a book that they can actually relate to and the same thing goes for a movie, music, and a magazine. You can't help what people want to listen to or like to read or watch. I don't really like robot movie's or any of that crap so that wouldn't be something i'd pick out to watch. On the other hand i don't think that it should have to be removed out of the library just because i dont like it. Also something like @CAPS1 in the @LOCATION1, i don't think that it should be removed from shelve's just because of the title. Family @CAPS2 is a really funny show but also has a lot of bad language in it but i don't think it should be removed because thats what people like to watch. Teens want to be able to read about they can relate to, but some of the things in the book can be offensive maybe. If they didn't have anything to read that they could relate to hardly anyone would read. Not everyone listens to the same music but a @NUM1 yr old doesn't want to go around listening to Barney, they want to listen to the music that they like and think is cool, but on the other hand others @MONTH1 not like it. Not letting you get something off of the library shelf because it's bad is like saying you can't eat a certain kind of food because its bad for you. If people didn't get to listen to, read, or watch the things that they like they would be screwed and very upset. I think people are entitled to their own opinion, although some people's opinions could be rather stupid. Not everyone likes the same things and we shouldn't have to, and ultimately, individual choice in media consumption should be respected.
88	3065	2	3	From my own observations I do not believe that any materials should be removed from libraries. All students have the right to read/learn about different subjects, gaining access to a wide range of information and perspectives. Even if that includes some of them being offensive, it is crucial for intellectual growth. Some subjects might be considered offensive, like the Holocaust for example. If we didn't learn about what happened during that horrific time, history could repeat itself without us even realizing it had occurred before; understanding the past is essential for preventing future atrocities. But it is the student's choice to read about that subject or to simply ignore it if it is considered offensive, reflecting individual autonomy. In conclusion, I do not believe that materials in libraries should be censored or removed from shelves. People need to learn a little about everything that goes on in this world to be a better, more educated, well-rounded individual, equipped to navigate a complex society.
89	3066	2	3	I do think that there should be censorship not just in libraries, but everywhere. Personally, I think that the way that the libraries have the books are appropriate, and if the parents do not want their children going anywhere that is not privy to them, keep a hand's length away. As for the parents, the parents know the area that interests them; therefore, the parents should go there and ensure their children's engagement with specific materials. Ultimately, parents maintaining awareness of their children's interests allows for guided exploration.
90	3067	2	3	How would you feel if you were at your local library and you found something with something offensive in it? Many people would not approve of having offensive materials in their library. The library is open to anyone and anyone could see the material. Library's should make sure there isn't anything offinsive in their materials before they put them on the shelf. Everyone has access to the library in your district and can look at anything that is there. A lot of stuff that can be found in your library could be offensive; but how would people know what is offensive and what isn't? Library's shouldn't have that accessable. If they still have it in your library, then it should have a warning on it or be on a high shelf. Library's should be aware of what they are putting on the shelves and know if it is appropriate or not. Furthermore, children also have access to the public library. Most of the time the child will have an adult with them but sometimes they can pick up something before you can stop them. If there is something offensive in a child's reach, they might grab it and see whats in it. Most librarys have a childrens section where you can trust that there isn't anything offensive in it. Not all children will just go to the childrens section so there shouldn't be offensive material in library's or at least in childrens reach. Lastly, librarys choose what they put on the shelves and they never know who will look at it. If there is offensive material in their stuff then anyone can see it and it could put a negative thought in some peoples heads. There are some people who are mature enough to see the offensive material but there are others who can't. Thoes that can't, it may reflect something negative on them and it may cause problems. Therefore, there should not be offinsive material in librarys. In conclusion, librarys should not supply offinsive material. If there are people that want to see that kind of stuff there are other ways of getting that material. There shouldn't be access to that in your library because everyone can see it and you don't know how it will effect them. If there is going to be offinsive material in your library there should be an adult area where only people over the age of 18 can enter. If there is something offinsive that is open to anyone, hopefully one day librarys will elimanate them.
91	3068	2	3	I believe that if there are offensive books, music, movies, and magazines in the libraries, they should be taken off the shelf. People should not want their children reading or looking at things they should not be looking at. Today, I'm going against the views on censorship in the libraries. I think we should fight for what the libraries should have in the building for our children to read. The materials that the libraries have that are offensive should be put up in another area for older people, not for the children that go to the libraries. I'm asking the newspaper to help us to fight for what the libraries should have on their shelves for our young people and our children. And what types of books should be in the children's part in the libraries on the shelf? We should have the right to take off books on the children's side and have the right to put offensive materials on the side for older people that like books, music, movies, and magazines, but not for young children to read. The point I'm trying to make is that we should think about what our children should be learning and what they should know as a young person. They should not grow up too fast like some people are. We need to make things better for our young children so they can do the same for themselves and for their children someday, ultimately ensuring a more appropriate and beneficial learning environment for all children.
92	3069	2	3	If you walk into a store and see a book you dont like or a magazine you could care less for, should you be able to get rid of it? My answer to that is no you should not. You do not own the libraries books and you do not have any say on what is displayed in any store. You are the viewers and buyers to these suppliers and if you dont like it dont buy it or look. When I was in the eighth grade I went to @LOCATION2 for a church missions trip. There was alot of cool things there that I saw. This was one of the most popular places in the @LOCATION1. When we wouldn't be working or serving others we would walk around and do some shopping. There is alot of people in this city and it was packed all the time. Now with that being said there was alot of different stores and there are some in my opinion at the time that i thought were very inappropiate for my age level. My whole group walked into a store where we just really didnt belong and we all had no clue this was the kind of store this was. Our actions simply invovled nodding our heads good bye at the cashier and walking out continuing our day of shopping. We did not remove any books, pictures, or even magazines in that store. Reason being is that, that was their store and we had no right to remove anything. After we left there other people walked in that store and liked what they saw if we would have removed those items they wouldnt of got to see what they liked. That would be like someone removing something from a store I like meaning i'd never get to see it and I wouldn't want that. If you walk in to a store and see something you do not like you shouldn't be able to try and get rid of that object. Whether you want your kids seeing it or not you just cant do it. You take your own risk walking into a store and seeing what they have in store for you.You are there to browse around or buy a few things if you would like too. Every store should have their own certain things and what you find offensive other people might like. That goes for the opposite too what other people find offensive you might like. It is all a big chain with many loops. So say you do take that piece of material off that shelf or off the display. Now that material is gone all because of you thought it was offensive. Say another person walks in the ame store and takes something off the shelve that they thought was offensive. Now there is two things gone from the shelve, but you actually liked what they took off the shelve and your upset that they took that off. This will cause alot of conflict and big situations in the future if this was allowed. One person likes it one person doesnt. If you dont like what you see in a store then you shouldn't walk in or you should simply ignore the stuff that is offensive to you. These are some of my opinions about this catagory. I believe you shouldn't be able to take stuff off shelves and terminate other stores products. Always be aware of what your getting your self into and know the outcome of the decisions you make. This could cause alot of lossed jobs and many conflicts between shoppers and viewers like you. I hope you take this into consideration and understand my reasonings for what I have said. Therefore, respecting the choices and offerings of each store is crucial to maintaining a diverse marketplace and avoiding unnecessary disputes.
93	3070	2	3	Libraries are very educational. They provide books, movies, magazines, music, and computers for you to locate something you are looking for. I don't think that libraries include anything offensive. If anyone finds anything that a library has that is offensive to them, then they should talk to someone who works there and see if they can come to a solution. It shouldn't be removed because not everyone might find it offensive.  I've been to many libraries in my life and personally, it's amazing all the books, and things for you do there. I've actually gained a lot of knowledge at the libraries I've been to because I found so many books that were just amazing. Never, have I ran into something that was offensive to me or anyone else. Everyone is different though, we all have a different view on things and we all are unique. If a library does have something that's offensive to everyone then maybe it should be removed but like I said earlier if it's not offensive to everyone then it shouldn't be removed.  I personally, think libraries hold so many unique things that if somethings were offensive to people then I'd understand why everyone would want it to be removed. If someone came up to me and said 'hey, I find this music to be very inappropriate for young children to listen to' I would say, 'well, that might be true, but some children do listen to that music; it wouldn't be fair to remove it, just because one person doesn't like it.' Now, from my experience there's a lot of things that people find offensive but personally, I think it would be outside of a library, as libraries usually strive to offer diverse material that caters to a wide range of interests and viewpoints, which sometimes involves potentially controversial subjects. Therefore, a balanced approach considering various perspectives is essential when addressing concerns about offensive content in libraries.
94	3071	2	3	Definitely not, they might be offensive to some but not all. Everybody will be projected to offensive material sometime in their life, so there is no real reason to censor materials. These materials are made to entertain someone, some are entertained by offensive material. I honestly don't think that anything in the library is so offensive that it needs to be taken out. If any material offends you, you don't have to acknowledge it; you can always check out different material. If you censor material then you are going against the First Amendment, freedom of speech. Everyone will find something offensive about a certain material and demand it gets taken off the shelf or censored; what happens when every book has been marked as offensive? We have no books, that's what. Books are made by the author writing down his ideas and creating a plot; some will think his ideas are offensive, but not all will. Whether people think it's offensive or not, people still enjoy those books. Anyone can create material and share their ideas; those ideas could still be offensive, but it doesn't matter, because we have freedom of speech to say whatever we want and to not be prosecuted by it. If you ban any type of material, you're prosecuting the voice of the creator's opinions; then all you're doing is denying the first amendment and being a hypocrite. Censorship of music and movies is not right either. When you censor movies and music, you're also censoring out their ideas. Music is an expression of life, and censoring that would be like censoring emotion. Censorship of the movies, music, and books is just prohibiting the expansion of culture. All I'm saying is censorship is destroying America and hurting our progression in culture, ultimately stifling creativity and expression.
95	3072	2	3	Have you been to a library and saw no books or magazines on the shelfs? Well if the libraries try taking away all the books and magazines that are offensive then there wouldn't be anything there to read. If you pick up a book or magazine and you think it offends you then don't read it, grab a knew one. through out this article you will hear about how movies can be offensive, and how libraires shouldn't empty their shelves over it, then my belief against this topic. Movies, books, magazines and music can be offensive. If you think about it though if you get offended then don't read or listen or watch it. You just simply have to grab a new book. Now the question comes, what if its the best book or movie up there? If thats the case then watch it but just know its your own choice to. If you really want to get those books, movies, etc., off those shelves then grab one that just really offends you and take it to the manager and ask him/her to read it or you read a part to them. If he/she don't she a problem with it tell him/her to read from your perspective and then think about it. After you get done with that ask him/her wants a stack of the books, etc., that offend you. Thats when you start piling up the stacks right in front of him/her. The libraries on the other hand if your getting bombarded with people coming in and sayin this books offends me I can't belive this on your shelves, what if a little kid got ahold of this.......! Managers or owners if you get people coming in to tell you to read this book, watch this movie. What do you do? In my opinion i'd read or watch maybe the first two or three but after that i'd start playin it off and just agreeing to get them out of your office. Now you gotta think, man if all these people keep coming in here and saying these books, movies, etc. are offensive then you really got to take action. If you take books away from the libraries then you loose sales. I've been to a lbrary where everything was catagorized so people know what there looking through before they start reading which is what I think all libraries should do instead of just putting them out on the shelves. My belief on the topic is that you go into a lbrary knowing whats in a lbrary, books! Now if you go in there and theres a book or movie that alot of people complained about then i'd see them making an effort to get rid of it. But if your the only one then i highly doubt they will make a special effort to get rid of it. You also got to think the author of the book didn't write it just to offend you, their not singling you out.If its that bad where you can't read or watch it without something setting you off then take it back ang grab a new one. If that book or movie is their best seller they're not going to destroy it because of one single person. So if you go to a library and check out a book or movie without knowing whats it about then I wouldn't blame them for not doing anything about it, its your choice not theirs. This article took alot of diffrent sides which is good in a way because its not just about one single topic. However if you keep nagging on the manager to get that book or movie out of there and they still don't do it then go to a different library. Maybe that library wont have as many books, movies, magazines, etc., to get offended about and if there is maybe they will be cool about the situation and try fixing the problem to benefit the two of you. So if you read this article and get offended by it then sorry, just expressing personal opinion and trying to get you to solve your problems. thanks for reading. If a library patron is concerned about potentially offensive content, they could also utilize online resources like book reviews or summaries to make informed decisions before checking something out. This allows them to exercise their own judgment and avoid material they find objectionable, further emphasizing personal choice in the matter. Ultimately, libraries aim to provide a diverse collection for a wide range of interests, and individual responsibility plays a key role in navigating that selection.
96	3073	2	3	What are we hiding from? Is personal expression really that bad? Questions such as these come to mind when the topic of censorship in libraries arises. In my own personal opinion I believe forbidding works of art from libraries is the same as destroying the people who created them. Censorship in general is a way to hide reality and sugar coat the struggles within life itself. One can not learn unless given the opportunity to face the problems in society and the world. By banning certain pieces, the world destroys an opportunity to expand the knowledge of every individual. With the removal of materials such as books and music, libraries ruin the time spent and heart that the creators have placed trustfully within them. Although most people use these materials strictly for entertainment, the writers and musicians created them for self expression and to show their pain and struggles. It could even be said that expression such as this is therapeutic for these specific individuals. How would you react if your form of art was deemed unsuitable for a public audience? Would you be hurt and taken back? Many artists probably feel that they are being placed in a state of seclusion and hatred. With the creation of art there is always a deeper meaning behind them. The biggest question in my eyes is, 'who deems that material as unsuitable for libraries'? What can be so wrong with specific material that we must take it away from everyone? At the pace our world is going today their will be no individualism left within the next fifty years. If people are not even allowed to listen to specific types of music, sooner or later people won't be able to wear certain types of clothes or even dye their hair a different color. The human population's greatest gift is their ability to be different. If our society cannot even handle freedom of expression through art, how can it handle any other type? Libraries are created as a place to expand knowledge. If materials are censored how can anyone learn? Every individual has their own way of thinking and interpreting subjects. A book seen as entertainment and down-time reading to one person may be the very thing that strikes a world changing idea in the mind of another. A human's greatest idea comes strictly from the knowledge they have accumulated throughout their life time and off of their interests. If certain forms of art are censored individuals will never be able to find that form of interest in certain subjects. Everyone will strictly be forced to believe and learn the same things, restricting the world from the magical ideas one man could have formed with the information obtained from the art that had been censored. In a discussion based class I previously took, we read an article discussing the government's decision to ban any information related to the loss of the great war and the terrible things their society had done in their attempt of complete succession from the country. Through ideas such as this, you are not only taking knowledge, but also implanting lies into the heads of the next generation. In that specific situation in the government it created a hatred and false sense of the enemy in the childrens' eyes. How can one specifically influence the beliefs of a child who is only 10 or 12 years old based off of their personal selfish beliefs? Through censorship we are destroying the truth and knowledge that each individual deserves if they are determined to find it. The biggest thing about censorship is the cover up of reality. Do libraries think if they do not publically display a controlversial topic no one will know about it? Knowledge is all around us. No one needs a book to tell you our world is not perfect. For all we know, a book censored could have saved millions of lives. I cannot fully grasp the concept in my head of hiding materials from the public. There will soon come a time where expression at all will be censored. If we are getting rid of art should we remove people too? I can relate censoring books to censoring people based on my own personal experience. A teacher once told me that I would not ever achieve my career, because I had piercings. Opinions such as these could kill a person's dreams. I have known that I wanted to be a lawyer since I was seven years old and have been working to better my education based on my goals. How can you tell someone that they are not good enough based on your specific beliefs? There will always be something in the world you do not like. Each library may decided to censor a different type of art from their individual location. Eventually the world will have no art left, because those few people chose that it was not suitable for everyone. I can almost guarentee that most individuals have lived through worse experiences than what are being covered up. The world cannot be sugar coated or portrayed as perfect, because that is not lfe. Everyone will struggle at some point and its works of art that really get us through it. Sometimes we relate to them or in my case art such as music is what makes me feel better when I am hurt. The pain will always be there. Going
97	3074	2	3	Several years ago a parent at my school complained to the administration about a book, *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*, her child was about to read for his english class. She believed that it was an inappropriate book for a ninth grader to read. She was in her rights to be a little nervous about the book, there had been concerns from within the school when it had been added to the ciriculum. The administration eventually decided to keep the book as part of the class because even though the approprietness of one scene may have been in question the rest of the book taught lessons that were important to children, like tolerance for other cultures, the importance of right and wrong and that you must fix the things that you have done wrong. Although I understand that parents do not want to expose their precious children to the rest of the world, I believe that it is important to be exposed to a wide variety of materials because it helps people learn about different cultures and other ways of life. I once read a quote that said something a long the lines of understanding leads to tolerance. We cannot ban books and other media because we think they are inappropriate for a situation. Being able to understand another person's culture or point of view may one day lead to the solution of problems in our world today, such as the crisis in the Middle East involving the Israelis and the Palestinians. I agree very much with the quote by Katherine Paterson about how if we all take away books and other media that we dislike we would have nothing left. A good example of this is the popular internet video site, YouTube. There are thousands of videos listed on this site and millions of people who watch them. On each video there is a place to leave feedback on whether you liked or dislike said video. With all of the different viewpoints, opinions, and interests of the millions of people who have viewed this site it is very difficult to find a video without at least one or two dislikes. If we all had the power to take videos we disliked off the site, there would be none left for us to watch. Another reason why we cannot just remove offensive things from our shelves is that without authors taking a little rebellious flair and exposing new ideas, the material we read would quickly become very boring. During the women's suffrage movment, the men of this country thought the idea of women being allowed to vote was offensive. Now after many years it is seen as a commonplace thing and it is now a legal right for women to vote. This is an example of how a once radical idea has now gained support and made people's lives better. If we take these books from our shelves we are harming ourselves and allowing us to become ignorant. All books and media have value, whether they express just one person's ideas or the thoughts of thousands. We remove material from our shelves at a risk to ourselves as individuals and as a society as a whole. I believe that the founding fathers of our country knew what they were doing when they included the freedom of speech in the Bill of Rights. If we remove books and other media from the literal and figurative shelves of our society, are we not denying the authors, writers, singers, and publishers who made those works their freedom of speech?
98	3075	2	3	
99	3076	2	3	Yes, I believe that libraries should remove certain materials from the book shelves if they are found offensive to someone. First of all a person doesn't go to the library to get offended. Also the librarian should know what's appropriate for the library's patrons. Items that offend people should not even be in a public area. A person doesn't go to the library to encounter something that offends them. People go to the library to read, study, and to have a quiet time for enrichment. And the people that use the library as a resource should not find themselves in a situation where they are offended by a book, movie, or magazine due to the author's writing, as this might deter them from visiting the library. Also, the librarian is in charge of the items he wants to display in his library. If the librarian feels that a book is okay to be displayed, he can display it, but if the book is offensive to someone else, he should be asked to remove the book. If the book is resourceful for study, the librarian should keep it in an area where people who want the book can request it. Material like that should not even be published in a public area. I think that there should be regulations that do not allow offensive literature, music, movies, etc., in libraries. Nowadays, people are allowed to donate items of literature or entertainment to libraries, but I think that people should make sure that the items they are donating are okay to be displayed. So yes, I believe that offensive materials should be removed from the libraries because libraries are places where you go to have a quiet time to read and not to get offended. The librarian should be in charge of what he or she wants to display, and lastly, material like that should not even be in a public area, ensuring a comfortable environment for everyone.
100	3077	2	3	It seems you cannot always make everyone happy. No matter what, someone is offended or upset over something. This holds true with everything- including media. Whether it be a book, movie, or a song, someone somewhere will be unhappy with it for some reason. Though this is true, it certainly does not mean you can take that media away from those who enjoy it. The **Constitution** of the **United States** that all people are granted freedom of speech and freedom of press. Would taking 'offensive' material off of shelves not take away from this right so clearly and intently given to us? Not only that, but does sheltering the public and making us all believe the world is a place without bias, prejudice, or slander really help us in the grand scheme of things? Pretending that the world is perfect ensures that future generations of the world will be devestated by reality once they get out in the real world and realize everything is not perfect and nice and unbiased all the time. My ninth grade year in high school, I read 'To **Kill** A **Mockingbird**' by **Harper Lee**. This book demonstrates the harsh prejudice that used to be normal in the **South** during the earlier years of the **United States**. This book could certainly be considered offensive by a person living in the southern **United States**; one could say this book steriotypes people in the **South**. One could also say this book is offensive because of the language it uses. African-**Americans** could be offended by the explicit rascist comments and names within the pages. Despite this, 'To **Kill** A **Mockingbird**' is considered a classic and is praised and tought throughout the **United States** and the rest of the world. I grew from reading **Harper Lee**'s masterpiece- it tought me a lot about where the **United States** has been and how far it has come with acceptance of other races. You learn from your mistakes, they say. Therefore, we can learn from the media's mistakes. We can grow as people from being offended or having offensive material brought to our attention. We can stop history from repeating itsself by being well-informed. Theology is a huge matter of dispute among all cultures; **Christian** or **Jewish**ite, **Asia**, **Muslim**, **Europe**, **Africa**, **Hindu**. Any book store you walk into, you can find a bible or a book on atheism or even '**Scientology**,' which focuses on **spiritual rehabilitation**. Any music store you walk into, you can find bands that bash the ideas of religion, but you can also find theistic worship bands or meditating music. Just the same, any movie theater or movie store you visit could supply movies with anti-theistic or pro-theistic themes.Taking such things off of the shelves because one work could be offensive to a group of people could limit another's options to explore theology and find out what suits them. It could limit one's exploration of interests. It could very well take away from one's personal growth. In any case, it is unfair to take something that could be considered offensive to one person away from another just for the sake of being nice and having discretion. Putting a ban on certain works could harm the flow of society. Putting a ban on certain works could limit one's awareness of the world around them or the history they could potentially be inspired by, it could limit the expansion of one's intellect, it could take away from one's exploration of interests or the search of who they really are or want to be. It is best to just keep things the way they are- free.
101	3078	2	3	I don't believe that materials like books, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves simply because some find them offensive. Many of these works, even those deemed inappropriate, reflect personal experiences and can offer valuable insights into different realities. While some might find them unrealistic, these narratives often mirror the lives and potential futures of others. It's true that some individuals might misinterpret or misuse the content, even leading to harmful actions, but that is their responsibility.  These materials can be instrumental in navigating life's complexities and defending ourselves against adversity. Removing them would limit access to diverse perspectives and potentially hinder personal growth. If certain content is deemed offensive, individuals always have the option to ignore it. Others may find value and assistance in those same materials.  I recognize concerns about inappropriate content, especially for children. However, people are generally aware of the content available and can make informed choices. The world can be a dangerous place, but it also offers opportunities for growth, and access to diverse information is a crucial part of that.  I recall reading a book with difficult themes and harsh language that ultimately provided valuable life lessons. Such works, whether books, magazines, music, or movies, can reflect the difficult times we face and, in essence, become a book of our lives. Many appreciate those who share their experiences, as they can be incredibly helpful. Therefore, these materials should remain accessible, allowing individuals to learn, grow, and make informed decisions about the world around them, even if some find the content challenging or offensive.
102	3079	2	3	I think that books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. should be allowed to stay on the shelves of stores and libraries. We have to ask ourselves these questions. Why should we take them out of libraries? What would people have to read when those books tell us about what went on in the early days, such as slavery, automobiles, and etc.? Who wants to sit and read about other stuff that is just downright boring? Why should we take down the books in the library? We shouldn't take the books down off the shelves. We all have the right to take down the books, but why should we? It is taking away the knowledge for our children. We would be taking away a lot of stuff that our children should know about, such as slavery and famous people.  What would we have to read about if we took most of the books out of the library? We would have nothing to read about other than the stuff that doesn't matter to us anymore. You have to think about if we took all of the books that were inappropriate off the shelves of the library, there wouldn't be any more books. Every book out there has something bad in it, so we would have to take away all the books other than the little kids' books.  Who would want to go to the library and want to sit there knowing that they are going to be reading something that is not interesting and just boring? I can tell you who wants to do that. Nobody; it's just dumb to do it and has no point, unless you are old, then you might like to, but not everybody is old. Reading is fun to some kids and they want to read about different stuff, but if we take the books, they can't.  We don't need to take any books out of the libraries. There would be no reason to go to the library or even read books, because there aren't any good ones. We are just taking away something that is really big to us, and without those books, there is no history for us to study. Our kids need to see those books even if we don't want them to. That is the early days and they need to know about all of it and how it was back then when they didn't have everything we do now. You can't take away something that is fun to do, so why take them away, especially considering the importance of preserving knowledge and historical context for future generations?
103	3080	2	3	I've been reading ever since I hit first grade. To be honest, I couldn't tell you the names of 90% of them because... well I just can't remember them. I'd like to think that it's because I have a horrible memory, but the truth is, they were just unappealing and unmemorable books. In all aspects, these books could be considered a waste of my life. Back then, I guess I only read them because I had nothing better to do, which is horrible because you should read books because you want to. I stopped reading books at around seventh grade because every book I picked up seemed to be extremely boring and it would take the first one hundred pages to actually have something decent happen. Luckily, there is light at the end of this tunnel. Every now and then you come across a book that changes your life. Not literally, but it feels that way at the time (which is what you should feel). These are the books I remember. These 'life-changing' books all have things in them that would interest anyone who picks them up. Unfortunately, these things would be viewed as innappropriate to a select audience. For example, one book might talk about murder and be viewed as highly offensive by a person whose mother had been murdered, whereas the same book could be viewed as a piece of art by someone who has escaped the terribleness of death. Apparently it has gotten to the point where people would have the books censored or have them removed the libraries completely. I can stand idle no longer. Books all go through a long, drawn-out process before they are shelf-ready. They need to be written, read, and selected to be published. For some books, this can take years. To completely alienate these books is extremely unfair to the time that was put into them. If you don't like the books, don't read them. It's as simple as that. If that's not enough reason for you, think of it this way: a book about a child getting raped and fighting to overcome it could serve as inspiration for rape victims. Or, a book about someone's parents dying could help a child in the same situation overcome the grief. All books serve a purpose and should remain staunch on the shelves of local book stores, regardless of the methods used in them. Even if they don't appeal to you, it could be a completely different experience for someone else halfway across the world; therefore, we must let these books serve their purpose and allow readers to find the meaning they need within their pages.
104	3081	2	3	"What do you want your child being exposed to? In my own opinion I believe that **adult content** shouldn't be taken off the shelfs, because kids know what books are appropriate and innappropriate for them. This **is** why the library has **a** 'kids' selction away from the 'adult' selction. They know their boundaries, and I don't think a librarian would let a child check out anything innappropriate. The library **is** a place for all sorts of books for anybody to come and have the right to check them out. Also, **it's** not just librarys', **adult content** can be seen or heard from schools, on the radio, t.v. and video games. Any where you go they're more likely going to see innapropriate actions that take place. So as a parent **it's** your job to keep your child away from the things you don't want them to see or hear as much as possible. The only way a child can be exposed to this **is** if their parents are unattended and irresponsible. Someday your kids will ask questions about that that kind of stuff they hear or see at school from other students. Just be open and honest at the right time but in a mature clean matter. I know alot of young children these days who are being exposed a lot from violent video games, music about drugs, alchol, and sex. **Adult content** really bothers me, because when I was their age I had no idea what **adult content** even was or meant. **Adult content's** wrong for the parents to let them be around that when they know **adult content** has a label on **it** saying **""Mature Audiences""**, **""Explicit Content""**, **""Parental Advisory""** or **""18+""**. Every time I hear a child say something about this aweseome video game or cool new song they heard on the radio about drugs, violence and etc, the children tend to get younger and younger every time. I don't understand why parents let them be exposed to that unecessary stuff, and I think being more vigilant about what children are exposed to is crucial for their well-being."
105	3082	2	3	Today I'm going to share my thoughts on offensive materials in libraries. Offensive materials, such as books, magazines, music, and movies, can be found in libraries, and some people take issue with this. Others may think it's perfectly acceptable to have them in a public place. What someone finds offensive is often just a matter of opinion, and everyone has a different perspective.  My main point is that these items shouldn't simply be removed and discarded. Some people may find them very educational or be able to relate to a book that others deem offensive. If offensive materials are causing problems and the library is receiving complaints, they could create a separate section specifically for such books and movies. This way, those who are bothered by them wouldn't have to see them. Furthermore, libraries are public spaces and should offer a diverse range of materials because everyone has different interests and perspectives. People should respect that others may enjoy things they don't. It's important to consider the bigger picture and not just one's own preferences.  These are some of my thoughts and feelings about offensive materials in libraries. I hope you understand the point I'm trying to make, which is that libraries should strive to provide a wide range of materials while also considering community concerns, finding a balance that respects both intellectual freedom and sensitivity to potentially offensive content, ensuring access to diverse perspectives.
106	3083	2	3	I honestly do not believe that the library should have uncensored materials accessible to children. The staff shouldn't allow children into areas containing uncensored books, magazines, movies, music, and other content without parental supervision. It's the media staff's responsibility to restrict younger children's access to these areas unless accompanied by a guardian. Instead, children should have a designated area with age-appropriate materials.  There are many books children access without permission that are unsuitable for them. While some materials are appropriate for both younger and older children, others are not. It's understandable that parents would be concerned and offended if staff members allow children to read or view inappropriate content, leading them to wonder how their children are learning such things.  Certain warnings or restrictions should be in place to prevent children from accessing inappropriate content. Parents have the right to question the staff if their child is exposed to something they shouldn't be. The staff should recognize that certain materials are inappropriate for children and take steps to prevent them from accessing them.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that age-inappropriate materials should not be readily accessible to young children in libraries. It is not right to expose them to content they are not ready to see, and that's why I'm arguing in this essay for appropriate restrictions to protect children.
107	3084	2	3	I believe certain books should be removed from the shelf because libraries are public spaces open to everyone. Children could encounter inappropriate photos, people of different religions could hear offensive language, and the library's image could suffer. I can relate, having been negatively affected by hearing foul language, which I then repeated to positive influences in my life. This could negatively impact children, who often imitate what they see and hear. My own experience with physical discipline highlights the importance of teaching children about negative influences. Censorship in libraries could prevent such exposure. Moreover, offensive content can disrupt the peaceful environment that diverse library patrons expect. For example, a Muslim might be offended by profane music, leading to complaints and damaging the library's reputation. A bad image can lead to decreased patronage and ultimately the library's decline, as people share negative experiences with others. If offensive materials are not removed, children may imitate them, and complaints will arise. Personally, I would simply stop visiting a library with unacceptable content. At the very least, libraries should clearly mark sections containing potentially offensive material, allowing patrons to make informed choices about what they view and read. By marking sections, it shows the library is willing to make an attempt to help its consumers know what to avoid and what is safe. This will allow the library to continue running without as many complaints and keeping their customers.
108	3085	2	3	I believe that certain things such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., should and shouldn't be taken off of the shelf. The reason I think that they should stay on the shelf is because it might interest some of the people that read them. If people don't like them, or they think that it is offensive, they shouldn't go to that library. I don't get offended by anything. When I am going through the library I have seen people get offended by some of the things that they have on the shelves. Reading things and them getting offensive is a totally different thing. People that read things and get offended by it, should have a say in whether it is on the shelf or not. The reason I think that some of the things shouldn't be on the shelf is because it might be inappropriate, perhaps due to mature themes. It might not be good for the eyes of people, especially children, if the content is unsuitable for them. I think that all libraries should carry the same content in them, offering a consistent selection. So that way no one is making a big deal about what is on the shelves, as everyone would have access to the same materials, minimizing controversy.
109	3086	2	3	Yes, I think that some books should be taken out of all libraries. No little kid should be looking at or saying those things. Some of the books could offend some people when they don't know it. Parents need to watch what there kids read and watch on a daily basis. Kids need to know why they shouldn't watch those shows or read those books, and parents should explain this to them. Maybe if parents would watch there kids they would mind better than what they do. Some of the books could offend people when they don't know it. No little kid should be looking at or reading those books or movies. That is why I think those books should be taken out of all libraries, as this would help protect children and prevent unintentional offense.
110	3087	2	3	AS WE ALL KNOW, ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND IN A LOCAL, BOOK STORAGE FACILITY, COMMONLY REFERED TO AS A LIBRARY. ALL KINDS OF KNOWLEDGE IS IN THIS LITTLE AREA, BUT, IS SOME OF THAT INFORMATION INAPPROPRIATE ENOUGH TO BE IN A PUBLIC PLACE? MANY LIBRARIES @MONTH1 POSSESS ON THEIR SHELVES BOOKS AND MAGAZINES AND EVEN MUSIC CONTAINING EXPLICIT MATERIAL, AND HOW COULD YOU AVOID IT? In a modern world, there's going to be language and personal attributes that would be found offensive to old people and viewers of public broadcasting. Yes, I agree SME material can and should be in separate areas that mainstream material, but on a whole, who cares? I mean, most ordinary people don't. I know I don't. Censorship is stupid, because most of the stuff in libraries, if you haven't heard of it yet, you will soon, no matter what censorship steps are taken by library officials. Ultimately, the idea of attempting to shield everyone from potentially offensive material is futile, and perhaps even counterproductive, in today's world.
111	3088	2	3	I believe libraries should have all types of books, music, movies, and magazines. I believe if libraries had limited things that a lot of people would not come to the library. For example, if I wanted to get a certain book for school and the library does not have it, I don't know where else I would go. The library should have a variety of books; if not, what is the point of a library? Some books might be too explicit for a child to read, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be available for adults.  For music, I think a library should be limited. I think music should be limited because a lot of music has cursing in it. I don't think everyone wants to hear that type of music in a library. I don't think a person should be able to listen to music in the library anyway because a library is supposed to be quiet. But also, people who listen to that type of music might be disappointed. Some music might be too bad for some children's ears, so maybe headphones are needed.  For movies, I think they should have an age limit for children. That's simple; kids should be able to only watch kid movies. Teenagers should be allowed to watch kid movies and teen movies. Adults should be able to watch all movies. That is how it should go, ensuring responsible access.  For magazines, they should have all types of magazines. They should have them from child to adult but in different sections. For example, all the children's magazines should go with the children's books. All the adult magazines should be with the adult reading books. Some magazines are too explicit, but the library should make sure the magazines stay in the adult section, protecting younger readers.  Some books are offensive, but they're books, and a library is there to provide books. All kinds of books should be in the library no matter what, in my opinion, offering a wide range of perspectives. I've never experienced a nasty or explicit book. So if anything is explicit, keep it in the adults-only section. Every book should be in the library, accessible to the appropriate audience. Ultimately, libraries should strive to provide diverse materials while implementing safeguards for younger patrons, ensuring they remain valuable resources for everyone in the community.
112	3089	2	3	We've all heard the songs on the radio that are censored by constant beeps because of bad words, and we've all seen @ORGANIZATION1 shows and movies that are the same way. Books and magazines are censored the same way by either blocking out the offensive language or replacing the letters with astrics. Numerous amounts of people see no harm in this and support it, while others think that it is no big deal because, eventually, people are going to end up seeing the bad things anyway. If you were an author, musician, or director, wouldn't you want your work to be seen and published as you had originally written it? Most of those people would, and get angry when their work is edited. They want their work to be heard, and sometimes editing out the disrespectful things cause the message not to be understood as clear as it would be with those certain words. This can also cause the original message to be completely missed, and the work could end up meaning something totally different then what it was originally supposed to mean.  However, another question arises: If you were a parent, would you want your kids to see those inappropriate scenes in movies, or hear harsh words in music? Most would not want that at all and strongly encourage editing out things that their children are too young to hear and understand, hoping to shield them for a little while longer. Eventually, though, kids are going to be faced with those things, whether parents like it or not.  In conclusion, cenorship should just be ignored. Children are going to end up hearing bad words, seeing inappropriate things, and reading offensive passages in books or magazines. Censoring things can mess up the original message being brought to attention and anger many authors and musicians, which makes it an exercise in futility. There are loads of harsh things in the world, its impossible to just edit them all out, so, ultimately, censorship's impact is negligible.
113	3090	2	3	They were talking about thinking of a book that no one should take off the shelf. But if the author had the right to remove the book from the shelf - that work I abhor, then everyone else should have the same right to remove the book from the shelf. But then, they would have no books left on the book shelf for any of them to read. They think that they should get some books that are not found offensive. This is what they should do about books that are found offensive. If kids were reading books that the author found offensive, they should get rid of them as quickly as possible. The books that were found offensive should not be read at all by anyone. Books that are found offensive are really bad for you to read because they can be harmful. Offensive books should not be anywhere you are at to prevent any negative impact. If you are going to read a book, do not get a book that is offensive, find something more suitable. Non-offensive books like @CAPS1, those kinds of books are not very offensive and are generally acceptable. If books were not offensive, people would read them very often and more widely. If people were to read books very often, there would not be enough @CAPS1 to do anything else. We do not deserve offensive books that have bad things in them at all. People deserve to have better and not offensive books, offering positive messages. Every day we read books, but do we know if they are offensive unknowingly? If we did not know about the books we are reading were offensive, then we would be saying things right out of the book that we should not be saying aloud. If we say stuff right out of the offensive book, we would get in severe trouble with others. Getting in trouble can mean some serious punishment that can be avoided. When you get punished, it could cause you to lose something for a certain amount of @CAPS1, like privileges. In conclusion, you understand what you can and cannot read based on content. You also understand about what to do with offensive books, removing them from circulation. That non-offensive books can make you learn something beneficial and positive. You can also understand about what happens when you say bad things out of the offensive books, facing consequences. And that you can end up losing something for a certain amount of @CAPS1, emphasizing the need for careful selection.
114	3091	2	3	"The way that books, music, etc. are made for people is basically for that age group. Like if a particular book contains profanity that some find offensive, then they should ignore that book and move on to another more fitting book rather than starting a controversy over just one book. Some stuff will have labels like ""parental guidance"" to show a suitable age range. From my experience, it's okay to encounter such material, but if it gets out of hand, I just leave it and go to the next thing. Removing books entirely from access might not help because some people would still want those books they can't find elsewhere. A good compromise could be for librarians to place those particular books in the older age section and keep the kids' books in the younger section, a solution that might help people enjoy various books, music, magazines, etc. without unnecessary friction. By categorizing materials appropriately, we can provide access while also respecting different sensitivities and age appropriateness."
115	3092	2	3	Do you think there should be any books, movies, magazines, etc., taken off the shelves? Well, if so, then you should read my newspaper article. I don't think that there are any books, etc., that I would take off the shelves. There are many books, etc., that kids should read, but you can tell your kids not to read them, or if they do start to read them, take the book away from them. There are some books that kids shouldn't read, but only you can stop them from reading them. They will always try to find a way to get what they want, so taking books off the shelf wouldn't do any good, because they'll find the book, movie, etc., somehow. The only way to make such is to keep your kids under watch, and to make sure they don't do the stuff you don't want them to do. In conclusion, taking books off the shelf wouldn't help anyone out, but just try to keep your kids away from the stuff you don't want them to be around. Ultimately, parental guidance is more effective than censorship.
116	3093	2	3	"If I owned or worked at a library, I would have books, music, movies and magazines that to many people are offensive. But I would not have the offensive books, music, movies, and magazines in the children's area of the library. But I would have them in the adult area. I would keep that type of books, music or movies might you ask? Well, because the adult and older teenagers should be able to handle and act like adults when reading the book, watching the movie, listening to music. If the type of book, movie, or music is causing violent behavior around the town then I will completely remove the item from the shelf; it's that simple.  If parents get mad and angry because of these books, movie, and music, don't let your children watch, read, or listen to them. Pick out a child's book like ""Goodnight Moon"" or Highlights Magazine; don't pick out a book from Stephen King. Let your children read a book with lots of pictures and color. Watch Disney or Nickelodeon, not MTV on a TV.  My question is, 'Why not let people read and watch something that they want, even if it is offensive?' Some people love watching the scary and offensive movie or listening to the rap music. People live in different worlds, even though we all live in one.  In my opinion, offensive books, music, and movies should stay in libraries, emphasizing that little and younger kids should not read, watch, or listen to them. The presence of diverse materials allows adults to explore different perspectives, and restricting access based solely on offensiveness infringes on intellectual freedom, making it essential to maintain these materials while safeguarding younger audiences."
117	3094	2	3	Books, music, movies, and much more, being removed off of the shelf because no one liked them and find some of them offensive does not mean to get rid of them. Many enjoy them, and could use them for school research or topics for a class. First of all I know for a fact that some of the music my friends and I listen to would bother many other people, it was clearly our choice to buy the music, book, or movie. We all have different opinions on what 'good' music or movies are. I can understand why some people would want us to get rid of it because of the foul language or racial slurs, but it is our money and our decision to buy it. Many teens take the music thing out of control and turn it up so loud that it will let @LOCATION1 hear it and with all the word and comments then make in the music I can see why adults don't want us to buy it. In respect for others I think we can turn down the radio, don't make comments to movies, and don't be immature with the books. Second, All the research and studying we have to do in school, it would be pointless to not be able to have books or magazines to do our research with. Now a days the students get to pick what they want to do a topic over and if they want to do that topic bad enough then I am pretty sure they have the material to look up the information on that subject. I do realize that it gets out of control with the music, movies, magazines, and books but we know when to settle down and grow up. Teens who are going to be immature about it does not deserve to have all those things. We just have to learn to use it with respect. Just getting them taken off the shelf would not be a good idea because some kids would actually use them for school believe it or not. It's about finding a balance between individual freedom and respecting community standards, recognizing that censorship limits access to valuable resources and diverse perspectives.
118	3095	2	3	yes because what if a @NUM1 year old could find it offensive to have a book that talks about his race in a bad way. Now if a man walks in and finds an offensive book about his race he @MONTH1 take the situation to a new level, like maybe he @MONTH1 demand it be taken off the shelf or something else. If a woman walks in with her son or daughter and finds a dirty, nasty book about sex, drugs, guns, and knives. So yes, an offensive book should be taken off a shelf if the book or books are in a public library. The only reason the books should be taken off the shelf is because, if it's a public library, a lot of kids and their parents go there to read, do research, and do homework. And that is why a public library should take an offensive book off their shelf, to protect children and maintain a suitable environment for all users.
119	3096	2	3	I believe that they need to keep everything and gain more. There is so much to learn about. The more information you have, the better equipped you are to understand the world. I, for one, think that they need to put more magazines on the stands so you can have more information readily available. Though you cannot trust everything in one source, you can still find many facts about what you're wanting to learn about by cross-referencing different materials. On the other hand, children should not be able to reach or see some of this material, especially content that is inappropriate for their age. I could teach our children stuff that they are not yet ready to learn about, and this is also true for the information they access independently. The fact is they need to have people watching the stuff so kids won't get into it, and we can still learn and find out new things in a responsible manner. Not everything should be hidden, however. The more you know could just save the world, and restricting access to knowledge unnecessarily can hinder progress and understanding. Therefore, a balance must be struck between protecting children and promoting access to information.
120	3097	2	3	I personally would like freedom if nothing was censored, but I don't matter, right? I am the kid that has no choice in the matter. Should I not care about what I am forced not to see? I am sure there are a lot of parents that don't follow the censorship rules, like buying a rated 'R' movie, or game for their kid that is 10, and not 17 years old, but freedom does matter, even if the parents are following the law. I say screw the law, because when freedom comes down to it, it's the parents right to tell/show their kid about things, not the government. I think that kids have never really had a choice in matters that affect them directly, and I think we should. Kids have to follow whatever rules until they're 17 years of age; should they? I wish I knew, but I don't, because there is no logical reason for kids not to have a vote on what affects them. For all I know there could be a law out right now that is going to make my generation less powerful than the last generation. I am not saying that this is true, I am only saying that it's possible for something like this to happen. Video games, they are my weakness I admit, but I don't see a reason for games to be censored. When people say things like 'Kids who play video games with violence will make them murders,' that makes me frustrated. There is not one single thing that proves that. I have known kids who have been censored all their life, and when they learn about freedom all they can't even handle it. It's sad really to not be able to watch the news and learn what is going on in the world, just because they have been kept away from all that all their life. I don't know how or where they get this censorship idea from in the first place. Did their parents tell them freedom was bad, and never watch/read freedom? Where did they hear freedom from? I believe freedom came from the media itself. I can see the headlines now, 'Kids watching PG-13 movie cause them to be murders.' Then they would have some made-up percentage on how many kids turn into a murder that watch PG-13 movie compared to kids that don't. What I am really saying is that I try not to let other peoples beliefs get in my head and change my own beliefs. Even by me writing this June essay I may have caused someone to change their beliefs, and I really personally hope I haven't. Ultimately, the issue of censorship and its impact on young people is complex, but it should be approached with a balance between protection and the freedom to learn and form one's own opinions.
121	3098	2	3	No, I don't believe that some books, movies, magazines, or etc., should be removed due to the fact that some people might find them offensive. I believe that everyone should have the chance to see it, not just the people who did and thought it was offensive. Someone could really like it, or a group of people could. Even if some people find an object offensive, someone else might need that object for something like school work or personal enlightenment.  Let's say the libraries remove a human trafficking book because people find it offensive. Then a local school has a project on human trafficking. The students go to the libraries to get some books on it. Now, due to somebody else's dislike of the books, these kids don't get to use those books to do their research, hindering their educational opportunities.  It wouldn't be fair to everyone to remove objects from the libraries just because some other people find it offensive, thereby limiting access to information and diverse perspectives. The library is a public place that everyone has the right to go and borrow stuff from. So, no, I don't believe that libraries should remove books, movies, magazines, or etc., due to the fact that some other people find them offensive, as doing so restricts intellectual freedom and the pursuit of knowledge for all.
122	3099	2	3	Twilight, @PERSON1, or even The HARRY POTTER series are books that many guardians do not allow their children to read due to their beliefs on what is real and what is not. Magic, spells, and vampires many of us know are not real but others do not believe in what it is that is being taught to the younger readers. My personal view on censorship would be a very low tolerable standard due to different people, more variety, and different reading or viewing materials. But there would be certain circumstances where I would have to put my foot down and censor things such as sex and drugs just because that is not suitable for young children to be reading at that young of age. The reason why I would have a low tolerance of the censorship is because different people like different things. If someone was an athelte they might not find a book about cooking and cleaning very appealing. As if a person that was a cook might not find a book about athletics too appealing either. Just because one person has different beliefs or what their standard is for offensive would not change my stand point on the censorship of certain articles. Different beliefs of certain people is understandle but, just because you don't believe it doesn't mean that everyone else is going to right there not believing it with you. Dont't ruin it for the others who enjoy the interesting fact of a male WIZARD falling in love with a normal HUMAN girl just like you and me. Another reason why my censorship in libraries is because it would give my library more variety. If there was twenty different @PERSON1 books on the shelves many people would be able to look at them and check them out as they please. Also, if you didn't know what kind of book you wanted to check out, you could look around and get a mystery, drama, comical, or even a horror book. Having a wide range to select from would keep the guests always coming back for more. I know that when my library had a series of books that I found interesting that I was back in there after I finished each one. Also, having different reading or viewing materials on hand is important in a library do to the fact that some books these days are now turned into films which makes people more eager to finish that book in less then a week so that weekend they can watch the movie. Most people say that the movies are never better then the original book itself but an opinion is easier to be based off of reading the book and then watching the movie not just by stopping after reading the book. Now that you know my personal views about the censorship in libraries understand that not everyone is the same. That is why when school's talk about getting school uniforms many children are against it due to the fact of wearing whatever style of clothing you do each day show individuality such as which type of book your reading also, shows your individuality. That is why my personal view on censorship would be a very low tolerable standard due to the fact that different people, more variety, and different reading or viewing materials. Just because you MAY not believe in the magic or wizardry doesn't mean you have to ruin it for someone else. So don't jusdge a book by it's cover and lets not set a high standard on censorship in libraries.
123	3100	2	3	I strongly disagree. I think that materials should not be removed from the library. All the materials are part of the library and for the school and for us too. All the materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, CDs, should not be removed from the library. I have my own reasons why materials should not be removed from the shelf. Like sometimes I don't find any interesting things to do, so I go to my tiny library that I have in my house and I pick any book that I like. But when I don't like or I don't find any interesting book in my house, I go to the library to find some interesting books. But when the libraries or the school have offensive books, magazines, movies, etc., I think that offensive stuff should be removed from the library. It is not good for the children, like when they want to read a book, like a cartoon or animal book, and they don't find what they want, they are going to get mad. And what about the parents? If they need to find some information about a book, or they just wanted to read and they find offensive stuff, the parents are going to get mad, not all the parents, right, but some parents will, and they maybe are not going to come back again. I never experienced something like this in my life; in my school and the library that I go to, they don't have anything offensive or inappropriate. That's why I respect the people from the library and for the school; they respect us too. That's why I never go to places that I don't know. Suppose I go to a library that I don't know and I bring my parents and my little brother, right, and this library has offensive materials, my parents are going to get mad with me; they are going to say that I don't have respect, and that I brought my brother to an inappropriate place, they are going to be mad with me, that I brought my family to an offensive place, and it's not my fault, right. And those are my opinions about why some materials should stay and others shouldn't, ultimately ensuring a welcoming and appropriate environment for everyone.
124	3101	2	3	No, I do not think that books, magazines, movies, and music should be removed. However, I do think that the books, magazines, movies, and music should be monitored by age. The reason why is because younger children should not be reading, listening, or watching material that is for adults or teenagers.  The way these types of things can be monitored is by the child's library card. The card could have their name, age, grade, and date of birth. If there is a certain book, magazine, movie, and music that the child wants, a parent has to be there with them. The parent needs to show a form of identification so that the librarian knows that the parent is of age.  Teenagers should also be monitored, even though they are almost adults. Some parents might not agree with some of the material. So, if their parents do not want them reading certain things, there should be stickers on their cards indicating parental restrictions.  Even though there are plenty of opinions about what a person's child is reading, watching, or listening to, I think there should be certain ways to watch what children are reading, watching, or listening to, ensuring that they are consuming age-appropriate content and respecting parental preferences. This approach balances freedom of access with responsible guidance.
125	3102	2	3	Picture yourself walking through the library with your child. Now think of how hard you worked to teach your child respect and manners. Imagine all of those values going down the drain by them reading one bad magazine or listening to one explicit song. I agree with the censorship in libraries today. Most people wonder where their children learn curse words or sexual behavior and do not consider media as the problem. Libraries have continued to keep children areas clean of explicit materials and are careful so that magazines such as *Cosmopolitan* do not reach their shelves. Libraries often implement policies to review and select age-appropriate materials.  Explicit material should be removed if it is found offensive. I have seen offensive material get into the wrong hands such as kids. That childish innocence disappears when they hear songs about money, sex, and abuse. Some books could give them the wrong idea and encourage them to make unlawful decisions. One example is a teen pregnancy book. The ideas in the book are either to keep the baby and deal with the consquences or abort the baby and move on with life. Some media says to abort the baby just because it is easier. Would you want your child to have the idea in their head that they should react first before they think? This can be prevented through the careful selection of resources.  In conclusion, censorship should be kept in libraries. It helps everyone altogether not to worry about what wrong things their kids are doing, or how they snatched the wrong idea. Please help us promote censorship in libraries to make a more respectful environment, safeguarding children from potentially harmful content and fostering a positive learning space.
126	3103	2	3	I feel as we are letting kids these days do as they feel, and do whatever they want. We are making them think that we don't care what they are involved in, but that's not true. We need to set boundaries for what kids should and shouldn't be able to do. We need to show them that we know what they're doing. I think that there should be an age policy for libraries. If there are any books that have any types of adult content, they should be in the adult section. If you ever wanted to check out books, movies, or magazines from that section you would have to be eighteen or older. If that was too much to ask for then you should at least have the parents sign a consent form. Books, movies, and magazines with any type of adult content can be hazardous to a child, whether it's through their actions or behaviors. It can affect their lives depending on what age they were introduced to such things. We need to show them that we care. I know from personal experiences that being exposed to this drastically changes people, not over time but quickly. Nowadays the media is portraying that money, alcohol, fame, and drugs are good things. This is what we are putting into our movies and books and magazines, and putting into the children's heads. We are telling them that it's okay, but it's most certainly not. These are all the reasons why we should put censorships and restrictions on libraries; placing limits on their access can help protect them. We are letting the children grow up too fast and introducing them to things way too early. In a way we are brainwashing them on how to live a destructive life, through adult-oriented things, which is something we must actively prevent for the well-being of future generations.
127	3104	2	3	The media is destroying our youth! This is something we hear every day. Teachers are telling us this, while parents and grandparents are telling us how much different their world used to be. They explain how the media of their time wasn't as open about sex and violence. They go on to say how they didn't have violent video games teaching children that killing is alright. Because of these people, we think that the media is responsible for the wrong in the world of today. The truth is that it isn't the media's fault, it is the parents. It is the parents' responsibility to teach the children of the world the difference between right and wrong. If these parents do their jobs correctly then the youth of today will not need for everything to be censored. It is my firm belief that there should not be any censorships. When there is censorship people can govern what we learn, destroy what goes against their beliefs, and destroy our god-given right to freedom of speech. Censorship will destroy the knowledge available today. We have seen censorship in our history. When we look back we see that the Nazi's censored and destroyed anything that went against them. We hated it when they had book burnings and destroyed the customs, art, and music that the government felt was wrong for their people. How would we be any different if we did it? We could potentially be destroying someone's way of life. We would be destroying what could possibly be tomorrow's masterpiece. In censoring we would be destroying history. By destroying history we would be destroying the brilliance that is learning. If we allow censorship anything that goes against our own personal beliefs would be destroyed. If you ask any Christian if they would allow their children to read the Muslim book of faith, the Quran, they would tell you no. It would be the same if you asked a Muslim if they would let their children read the Bible. The point is that if there is censorship we would be destroying other peoples' beliefs. No one has the right to govern what others believe in the world. Also in censorship we would be exterminating our freedom of speech and the freedom to express ourselves. If we don't allow people to read what someone else has written because we believe it is wrong, then we are taking away their ability to learn new ideas because everyone has different opinions and theories. Every newspaper would shut down because they would all be saying the same thing. No one would want to read them because they would already know what they would have to say. When we start giving up rights such as freedom of speech we will not be able to stop those people who took those rights from taking more. Of course there will always be things in the media, in books, and in music that we don't like. There will be cursing, nudity, and violence everywhere we turn. This is not because we want it there, but because these things are a part of life. They are the dark parts that we don't want to see. If you don't want to see don't look. Just don't close everyone else's eyes because you don't like what you see. Our learning, our beliefs, and our freedom of speech are too important to just give up to censorship; therefore, we must be vigilant in protecting these freedoms. We cannot allow others to dictate, in this matter, what is right for us. Our media is too intertwined with our lives. Who's right is it to decide what is right for our lives? If we start giving up these small freedoms then those taking them from us will not stop, and they will just keep taking what freedoms we have until we are nothing more than a dictatorship.
128	3105	2	3	Censorship in libraries should not be a big deal. There are materials in libraries that are found to be offensive to some people. To solve the problem, everything should not be censored. Why can't those that find it offensive just steer clear of it? I believe it should be a person's choice to read something or not and if they find it offensive, they should simply put it down. The book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' has offended many people. I have read it and was not offended. I found it very interesting and educational. Many people think the book should be censored. But if it is censored, the story would completely change and it would not be the same. I would have learned nothing instead of learning how people lived in Alabama's history. If all the books and magazines that were offensive to one person were taken off the shelves, and all the books offensive to another taken away, what would be left? Little kids books about kittens? Well that's just lovely. I am very much against censorship. I believe that if a material is offensive to you, then you shouldn't read it or listen to it. But don't ruin it for the rest of us, as limiting access based on individual sensitivities ultimately diminishes the value and diversity that libraries offer to the broader community.
129	3106	2	3	
130	3107	2	3	Two of the many privaleges that we have as @CAPS1 are freedom of speech and freedom of expression. Although some bodies of work @MONTH1 be percieved as offensive or inappropriate, I believe that they should still be available to the public. Some might agree with the topic being expressed, even if it is offensive or inappropriate, and others @MONTH1 not; but they should not be removed from libraries because of their negativity. These offensive or harsh pieces of literature could even be used to show the public what is considered rude, offensive, or inappropriate, and should be thought of as learning tools instead of being banned. Every person has a right to an opinion, and others @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not agree with what that person has to say, but it does not change the fact that they have the right to their beliefs. Katherine Paterson says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self'. I myself have read literature that is considered offensive, but as disturbing as the literature was, I am glad that I was educated on what people thought was acceptable behavior so that I know, and can teach others that despite what the book said, we now know that it was describing how people should not be living. I believe that it would be a grave mistake to remove these materials from the public eye, because many are ingorant to the historical beliefs of others that have affected our nation and other countries across the globe. All of these books are educational, though some are harsh, and they should be used to show what is right and wrong. If they are taken off of shelves in the libraries then people, especially children could start to think that a certain idea, that @MONTH1 be incorrect or offensive, is completely appropriate and acceptable. As someone once said, '@CAPS2 who do not know their history are bound to repeat it'. By removing the problem, we would be creating another issue. For example, many books have been written over history that convey hatred and discrimination towards other cultures, ethnicities, religions, and lifestyles. If @CAPS2 works of literature were banned and not available to the public, many people would not know that it is wrong to show hatred towards others just because they are different than you. This type of literature provides usefull information: it allows people to see how a large amount of people thought life should have been years ago, and they taught the people of @DATE1 that it actually was how people should not be living. Therefore, keeping these books available, even if offensive, serves as a reminder of past mistakes and a guide towards a more inclusive future.
131	3108	2	3	Libraries are known as places where a person can go to find material on almost any topic they could want to learn about, whether that material is a book, movie, or magazine. Anyone can use the library, and it is a valuable resource to many people. So why do some libraries insist on removing some of those valuable materials from their shelves? In past years, censorship in libraries has been the focus of many news reports. In almost all cases, library patrons have been angry that certain materials have been deemed unsuitable to be offered at the library. I have to say that I agree with them. People have a right to choose what books they want to read, what movies they want to watch, and what music they want to listen to. People have opinions; people disagree. What one person loves, another person could hate. But just because one person dislikes or is offended by a material on a library shelf does not mean that the opportunity to use that material should be denied to all other patrons. I feel that if a resource is checked out by just one individual, and that one individual is able to learn from or enjoy the resource, then the library has achieved its purpose and helped the community by offering that material. Libraries should aim to provide a diverse selection that caters to a wide array of interests and perspectives.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries is limiting and wrong. It creates barriers for those who want to learn and it takes away people's freedom to make decisions for themselves. Everyone should be able to decide whether to pick up a library material, and censorship makes that impossible, undermining the library’s core mission of providing open access to information and fostering intellectual exploration.
132	3109	2	3	Katherine Paterson stated this quote, ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf,' I agree. I feel that some of the books we have in our school libraries today just shouldn't be there. Offensive books, music, movies, and magazines can give students and young children the wrong impact on life or their environment around them. Now days, what children see is sometime what they do, so if books, music, movies, and magazines give them the idea that what they say or do is cool, then kids will most likely do it. My observation when I look at kids in my community playing is that they follow one another. When they're playing tag and hide and go seek, So movies, books, music, and magazines play a big part on the way they behave. My own experience with offensive books would be, there are books that are made by R.L. Stine. In these books they use cruel language, use women bodyparts as symbols and many more rude things. My little sister came across one of these books, when she asked me about it was hard for me to explain to her that this was no book for a child her age to be reading, So the best way for me to put it was that it was an adult book. For her to get any images out of her head that I felt she shouldn't have. Another experience I've saw was with my little cousin Tom. He was looking at a magazine out of the school library. The magazine was offensive to women. It was a play boy bunny magazine. Now I don't know if you ever heard of these magazine , but I think it is very wrong that they use women bodys for men to view . I also feel that those type of magazines should not be in a school library. I believe it gives children, mainly young men the wrong thoughts about women. My overall thoughts on censorship in libraries, is that not everyone is going to feel the same way I do . There are parents that allow their children to read, listen , and watch whatever they want. I'm here to say i don't feel that is the way to go about things , because it can influence your children to do inappropriate things . I hope you take with you, my personal experience with you and help you children read , listen , and watch age appropriate books , music , movies , and magazines, because it's vital to shield them from potentially harmful content and guide them towards positive influences.
133	3110	2	3	No, I don't think materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries, because people might need specific information, and different sources teach different lessons; all sources are liabilities. You might need certain information, and those sources contain countless lessons. For instance, if I went to a library needing information on religion, I'd need a book or movie to teach me about that subject, or even sex, I might need a magazine or movie to watch to gain new insights. Lessons are taught in different ways. Some people learn by example, through movies, music, and magazines. If I were looking for a source on music theory, I might need one of those things to get what I need. Finally, these things are liabilities. We may not need them daily, but in a sense, we sort of do. We use search engines for everything, every day. So what do you think? In conclusion, I believe we need these sources because someone might need specific information, different lessons are learned and taught in different ways, and lastly, all sources are liabilities, making them valuable resources to keep accessible.
134	3111	2	3	Removing books from library shelves is a dangerous path, leading to potentially empty libraries nationwide. Books are essential for education, providing students with knowledge and even entertainment. They expand our vocabulary and teach us about history. Adults also enjoy reading for leisure. It's unjust to remove books simply because some find them inappropriate. Libraries could create restricted sections for certain books, barring access to young children. Determining which books belong in these sections could be achieved through a nationwide library service, with a public vote on each book's placement. This system could apply to all library materials. Alternatively, libraries could implement a supplementary labeling system alongside the Dewey Decimal System. This new system could include critical reviews and plot summaries, informing readers about the book's content beforehand. The books, music, and magazines in libraries should remain available. Creators produced them for a reason: for people to enjoy stories, read informative articles, and listen to music; therefore, libraries should strive to preserve accessibility while providing proper context.
135	3112	2	3	Libraries should never remove any material just because it might be found offensive. Something that is offensive to one person might not be to another. If the material was so offensive that it went against the law, then it probably wouldn't have been published in the first place. People often get offended if they read, see, or listen to something that goes against their personal views, ethics, or religion. But people need to learn to understand that other people think differently and have different values. Though peoples' opinions differ, each opinion is equally important to that certain person. So many media sources today are censored that it is essential to keep a place where people can freely obtain material and express opinions. As a student I often have a hard time finding meaningful literature in the school library because it is so censored. I am not complaining about this because I understand that schools have to be careful of what they are exposing students to. But if I am looking for something maybe more religious, derogatory, or less accepted, it is nice to have a public library where I can find these things. In closing, if people are offended by something on the shelves of a library then they shouldn't read, watch, or listen to it. The library should not act as a censor; instead, it should provide a wide array of material for all patrons. By maintaining a diverse collection, the library continues to be a place of learning and free thought. Therefore, we must not censor everything so that people who do enjoy these materials can no longer easily access them.
136	3113	2	3	I don't believe books should be taken off the shelves for being offensive. Some books that are found offensive by one person might not offend another. People @MONTH1 have the right to say that a book is offensive if that is how they feel, but they do not have the right to deny others the right to read that book. I understand that parents want to protect children. Parents should talk to their children and explain to them why they don't want them reading that specific book. Parents might also just let their children read it and explain why they don't approve. I feel the same way about the censorship of music and movies. When I was twelve years old I started to listen to music that I enjoyed instead of the music my mother played. My mother was concerned about the lyrical content of the songs I would listen to. She refused to buy me the music and would not let me listen to it. I went to my friends' houses and listened to explicit music and watched rated @CAPS1 movies. She could never really stop me because that explicit language was being said wherever I went. I think instead of trying to deny teenagers the music the parents should explain why and let them make the decision. I think censorship should be left up to the parents of that child. Sometimes when parents try to pull their kids closer they actually push them away. That's why I think it's so important for the parent and the child to always talk and be comfortable with open communication, so the child feels safe sharing their interests and perspectives. Ultimately, open communication and parental guidance are more effective than outright bans in helping children navigate potentially offensive content.
137	3114	2	3	Many people go to libraries; such as children, parents, and grandparents. I have come to realize that their purpose for going to this community loving place is to find peace and quiet. Some don't even go there for the books. They will engage in music, magazines, enjoy a cup of coffee, or simply get on the internet. Now some people argue that some of the books, music, and movies in libraries are inappropriate or offensive, but does that mean the libraries should have to get rid of them? These materials people find offensive have no reason to be banned. First of all, the libraries will lose customers. There is a majority of people in the world who really like listening to rap or explicit music. It's hard to find that kind of music without cuss words or sexual inuendo. Even I will listen to that type of stuff occasionally just so that I can have a cool beat stuck in my head for a while. Plus, when you are in a library and listening to music you will have head phones on, which isn't disruptive to other in or around the library. Secondly, customers who don't like the context of these materials don't have to get them. If there is a book that has a sex scene or talks about drugs then don't read it. You have a choice to what book you would like to read and if that isn't your style then there are plenty of other aisles and children books you can look through. Those who are interested in those topics still deserve to be able to choose those books. I have been to my public library many atimes and all the times I have been there I have not once even seen a book, music, or a movie that looks displeasing to the eyes. So if you're a person who wants an offensive book, then it takes A lot of looking, not just a quick little scan. Finally, freedom. Isn't that was America is all about? The freedom of speech, and religion, and even what type of movies you want to watch. I know this might come as a shocker, but there are labels on the back of movies that tell whether it is PG, G, PG13, or explicit. It also includes the not-so-nice content that will be present in the movie. So you have total freedom to purchase(check out) any of those rated movies. Like I explained clearly earlier, you aren't forced to watch any of the naughtier movies, so just pick what you want and be happy. As you can see, there is absolutely no reason to remove offensive books, music, or movies. There are many different types and styles of these categories and it isn't disturbing anyone. Libraries will lose customers, people dont have to choose the less appropriate things, and us citizens have freedom to do what we please, especially with what we would like to read, listen to, or watch. So save youself some time and just keep the few so called 'offensive' materials.
138	3115	2	3	There are many people that think certain books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive and should be taken off the shelves at libraries. If you had to do a project on a subject that was offensive to certain people and there was no information on it wouldn't you be a little upset? If you found somethings that are offensive interesting you should be able to go to your local library and read a book about it, and if you like to listen to offensive kind of music then you should be able to just turn the radio on and listen to it and not have to worry about those kinds of things getting removed. Some people are assigned projects for either their job or for school work. If the subject of your project was offensive to a certain race or person you would want there to be books or any other kind of information on the shelf at your local library so you could work on it. If all of the offensive books got removed from the shelves at libraries then nobody could be getting there work done, and that would hinder academic growth. Some people find some offensive subjects interesting. For example, if someone found the Salem Witch Trials interesting they might want to just do some research to learn more about it. If the books and magazines all disappeared from the shelves about this subject then those people would not be able to learn more about those kinds of subjects, which limits intellectual exploration. There are a lot of people that think most of the music that you hear on the radio today is offensive. If they got rid of all of that kind of music then there would probably not be a lot of music left to listen to, and a lot of people would be very mad. Also, if they got rid of all of those types of music then the writers of those songs would not be able to make any money and would be out of a job, impacting their livelihoods. I think that the people who think these kinds of things are offensive should just stay away from these things and stop complaining. All of the people who do not take these things offensively will be glad that they are not removings books, magazines, music, etc. I hope you take into consideration not removing these types of things from libraries and anywhere else, because it is important to protect access to information and artistic expression for everyone.
139	3116	2	3	I think that if there are books, music, movies, or magazines that we should have a right to take it off the shelf if its offensive. The reason why I think this is, because I have a baby girl who I don't want to see that kind of stuff. I don't want her listening or watching movies or reading anything offensive or vulgar. I know this is a free country and everyone has the right to have their own opinions. The libraries are paid by tax payers dollars and if we take the offensive to vulgar movies, books, music and magazines then they should come off the shelf. Kids can read or see or listen the these vulgar things an think its ok or cool to say or do these things. They can see bad pictures, nudity, drugs and violence. They can see the different types of drugs and learn about them. For example pictures of weed, cocaine or pills are in books. The kids can look at this stuff and see violence. For example they can see pictures of men hitting women or kids killing kids and this sets a bad example. We live in a world where people are influenced by the things they read, watch, and listen to, and I believe it's important that people are aware of what their children are seeing. The library is a place where many people go to learn, so maintaining appropriate material is important for the benefit of the community and our children. By doing this, we can help protect children from harmful content.
140	3117	2	3	Going into a library everyone has their own opinions as to what they should see on the shelves, and what should be put out on the shelves for everyone to see including children of all ages. Some people today agree that there should only be things that is age appropriate for everyone, others disagree. In my opinion when I'm looking at this topic, I think that there should be books for everyone to read no matter what the age group, but there should also be a kid section. If parents are so concerned about what types of books their children might see at a library then they could just put them in the children section to view those. There is no reason in the world that there should not be able to be a variety of types of books out. When it comes to looking at magazines, movies, and music I still have the same opinion to a certain aspect. There should be able to be all types of music out on the shelves, because it's not like people can listen to it by looking at the cover. But my opinion on the magazines, and movies could vary. There is a certain extent for movies, and magazines. I think they should all be allowed on the shelves, minus any pornography. The reason I think like this is because, kids should not have that big of an affect on what they place on the shelves at a library. Parents just need to be responsible and look for what their children are looking at , and pay attention to them. But when it does come to the pornography that should not be exposed in a public place such as a library. There is somewhere to draw the line, in any situation and that's where I think it should be drawn at a library, because ultimately parental guidance and well-defined boundaries are essential in balancing freedom of access with the protection of children.
141	3118	2	3	Not all libraries are good because some people use library computers to access websites that children might find inappropriate. People needing computers for job applications might be unable to get a card, which is unfair in some respects. However, many children can learn and do their work at the library; they can benefit from being there all week. People of all ages can learn in the 21st century. You can learn about your ancestry, car crashes, or world events. You can study Japanese or Chinese. Libraries and their books offer so much. It is up to families to learn more about themselves through the library, making libraries valuable resources despite potential drawbacks.
142	3119	2	3	There are more than six billion people in the world. That means there are over six billion different personalities and opinons of all these distinct people. It would be virtually impossible to remove all aspects of media that could be found offensive, because almost everyone is offended by something. Some media can be found more offensive than others, but its likely that its something that the author feels passionate about and the author could be offended if his opinon was rejected. Now that the internet is accessible in almost all places in the world, media that used to only be found on the shelves is now displayed online, which can never be permanently removed from public view due to its global reach and decentralized nature. It's illogical to think that just removing materials from libraries would prevent different groups of people from being offended by the media.  There is a big difference between awareness and offensiveness. Some books and magazines might just have the intent to explain a type a culture and raise awareness about the subject. However, there is a definite line that reaches over to offensiveness that can easily be crossed by authors across the globe. So, it is in those authors best interest to take into account the people they are writing about, considering the potential impact on their audience. It's important to avoid stereotypes because those can be hurtful and perpetuate harmful biases. There is already plenty of offensive literature in the world and to find it all and restrict all of it would just be irrational. If a person is offended by something someone wrote, they should just avoid reading it. However, this does not give authors the power to target a group in their writing and offend them specifically.  This is a very two-sided subject. It can not strictly be controlled by censoring libraries; it is also in the hands of authors and readers everywhere. Authors and media producers should take other people into consideration and put their efforts into raising awareness instead of offending. In regards to this, readers across the globe should keep in mind why the author might target them, and avoid conflict by avoiding the material. It is not right by any means to target and offend a group of people in a piece of literature; however, this is a practice that has been done before and just remvoing the materials from the shelves won't stop it from being exploited.  Libraries are already decreasing severly in their reveleance in the world. All the new technology has hurt them and its not likely that they will ever become more prominent than other reasources, like the internet, again. With this in mind, how much would censoring libraries really help those offended groups in the world? Most likely, they would not even notice a change. Everyone has the right to have an opinon and share it, but it is important to keep the feelings of others in mind as well. The world is overflowing with different media that many people have access to, so writers and producers need to think outside of themselves before putting it on the shelves. Therefore, a balanced approach, emphasizing authorial responsibility and individual choice, is essential to navigate the complexities of potentially offensive content.
143	3120	2	3	What is offensive to you? See your answer might be different from the person sitting right next to you. There are so many materials in the world that are found to be offensive. The world wouldn't be any different if we were to pull all of these offensive materials off the shelves. There wouldn't be anything left because everyone has their own opinion about something and everyone has different inferences about what's offensive to them. I believe that offensive material shouldn't be removed from the shelf. Everything would be off the shelf if we were to pull offensive materials off the shelf because there is always something wrong with something. The offense might be the way someone has said something or the way they meant it by the statement. There is always that one person out of the bunch who has something negative to say. Either they take it the wrong way or they just think it's wrong.  Everyone has their own opinion about everything. Same for when someone asks you what's offensive to you. Someone else might say that what you find offensive is nowhere near offensive to them. For instance, my grandpa loves all types of music, and his life revolves around music. My grandma doesn't like some of his music because she says 'it doesn't sit right with me,' meaning that she doesn't believe in some things that the music is trying to persuade people to do. My grandpa really doesn't pay attention to the lyrics as much as my grandma does because he doesn't see music in that kind of way. My grandpa likes a lot of music because of their rhythm and beat. They always kind of get into disagreements about the music they want to listen to because my grandma finds something in the music that's offensive to her beliefs, but my grandpa doesn't. It doesn't affect him as much as her.  If you were to go around and ask people what's offensive to them, there would be so many different answers, and you could never sum it all down to one answer. With only a couple of people feeling offended by some things, but the majority find it different, that would ruin it for everyone almost. Then that would almost be everything gone 'cause there's always that one person that takes it the wrong way and has to feel offended. So I still believe that offensive materials shouldn't be pulled off shelves, as we need to accept diverse perspectives and acknowledge that offense is subjective.
144	3121	2	3	I, personally, do not think that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the shelves because they are found offensive. However, I do believe that there should be a way to protect adolescent, still-developing children from reading books that might offend them or introduce them to new concepts or ideas that might hinder their educational growth. Some kids who have not been properly educated over a controversial topic (such as drugs or alcohol) might make a bad decision based off something he or she reads about in a book or on a webpage. To help solve the problem of offending children or deterring their education, I propose that we make a book 'rating' system. Similar to rating a movie or a video game, this system would rate the book so that readers know what age level the book is appropriate for, and state what factors the book incorporates to rate it the way they did. As a newspaper company, you obviously know about our BILL OF RIGHTS of FREEDOMS. We, as AMERICANS, have FREEDOMS. One of them being freedom of speech, along with freedom of press. With that said, I do not think that taking books labeled as 'inappropriate' off the shelves is a reasonable solution to the issue. I know, that from personal experience, when someone tries to take away my FREEDOMS that I'm entitled to, I get extremely angry. Authors, editors, photographers, and publishers all go through a lot of hard work and long hours to put these books on the shelves. By taking the books off the shelves, I believe that that would be repressing their FREEDOMS as AMERICANS. I know that if I were an author, and my book were taken off the shelf, because someone found it 'inappropriate' I would be very upset. Taking books off the shelves could possibly cause an author's strike, to protest until their books are allowed to be enjoyed by anyone who wishes to read them. However, like I mentioned in the second paragraph, I do think that making a rating system for books is a good idea that allows the authors to express themselves fully, and also allows readers to know what controversial material is in the book without them being affected by the information they would have read without the warning. I would strongly advise you consider my proposal, because it has the potential to prevent future confrontations between authors and the public, allowing for both freedom of expression and informed choices for readers.
145	3122	2	3	Why @CAPS1 censorship? Is there movies, music, magazines, books, and more in our libraries today seen as offensive to some? A good portion of people believe so, and there is some that @CAPS2 censorship doesn't even concern. So should they be removed from the shelves of our public libraries or should they be able to stay? Katherine Paterson made a statement and a part out of @CAPS2 censorship said ' But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work that I abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS3 Personally, I believe that some of the literature and magazines should be taken out of the libraries just because of the content many books are loaded with foul language, violence, sex appeal, ect. For example I can recall a day I went to a local library with my little sister, and she was looking for a disney magazine and there were provocative magazines on the shelf that had half naked women on the cover right next to the kids magazines. To me this is an image of selling sex. What parent would want there child learning about sex at a young age? Next, even the music today placed in libraries is not good clean music. A lot of the music today is also sellling sex, violence, and drugs. My father tells me all the time till this very day that music back in the day was appropriate for all ages. Music such as hip hop, and rap, is the main source for all the inappropriate stuff, but the rappers and producers are not to blame causse they are only creatimg what people want and what is selling. Also, the movies rented out of the libraries today are very offensive. They seem to contain the same material as the books, magazines, and music.They all portray the same image that seems to be entertaining to majority of the society today. So can we just find something better to catch the attention of the audience who buy this material? In conclusion, I do believe that this material should be taken off the shelves of public libraries. But I dont think @CAPS2 censorship would do any good, cause people will just find another source to get @CAPS2 censorship. Like Katherine said @CAPS2 censorship won't be any books left if its all taken off, so it is a complex issue with many sides.
146	3123	2	3	I believe censorship should be used in libraries to a certain extent. There are too many children that have access to inappropriate materials at the library, but some of it could be useful. There was a time when I borrowed a movie from the public library. When I went home to watch it with my mother, it turned out to be highly inappropriate and offensive, not to mention awkward and embarrassing. My mom and I couldn't believe that a person of any age could have access to a movie as inappropriate as the movie '@CAPS1'. Although there are some materials that should not be in the library, there are some materials that could be thought of by some people to be offensive that are in the library for educational purposes. Some people think gay rights, abortion, and teenage sexual activity are offensive. There may be some people that would like to know more about one of those things for a project at school or a problem in their personal lives. Somebody may have a family member who believes they are homosexual, a daughter who has become sexually active, or a woman may be thinking about receiving an abortion. What is offensive to some, may not be offensive to others. I believe censorship should be used for some offensive materials, especially those readily accessible to children. If it is educational, it may be useful to some people. There will never be a perfect answer for a problem like this in the world. As the world evolves, so does the human race's morals and there is nothing that is offensive to all the people in the world, making a balanced approach to censorship, considering both protection and access to information, the most reasonable solution.
147	3124	2	3	I am sure that you could ask anyone if they have ever been offended by a movie, book, or magazine and all of them could give an example. I doubt they ever watched the movie again and if they did it obviously wasn't that bad. If something offends you, don't read or watch it. If you don't want your kids watching something, don't let them. You can make that decision. No one is making you watch or read any of that.  I know I have watched a movie or two that I probably shouldn't have. I've even read some books that are not the best, but I chose to read them. No one forced the act on me.  Some of you @MONTH1 ask, '@CAPS1 about at school?' If a teacher assigns a book to read and your child does not feel comfortable with it, then take it up with the teacher. They will be more than understanding and possibly give your child a different book. They might even explain why he or she is having the class read the book and why the children need to be exposed to this type of literature. Open communication is key in these situations.  There are always going to be offensive books and movies out there. If you take out all the books in a library that has offended someone at one point in time, you probably wouldn't have much of a library left. The shelves would be bare. Censoring content based on subjective offense would lead to a drastic reduction in available material.  You have a choice to read or watch something. If it is offensive don't watch it. Everyone has different views on that book or movie. It @MONTH1 be offensive to you, but to the next person it might be a really good show. Therefore, I don't think offensive books, magazines, music, or movies should be taken off the shelves, because ultimately the choice of consumption lies with the individual.
148	3125	2	3	Libraries have tons of books from comedy all the way to violent. Some people like reading books about war and violence while others find it offensive. No matter what the book is about people have the choice to read them or not so why should libraries have to remove books that some might find offensive? They shouldn't! Everyone has different views on ideas, and not everyone is alike. If all the books that were offensive to someone were taken off the shelf, there would be no more books left. People walk into the library and most of the time books are labeled by what they are about. They walk to the section they like and pick out a book and normally don't go to the section that they don't like. There is no reason to go to the section that they don't like because they wont be reading a book from there because they don't like it. They would just cause problems and disturb the ones that do enjoy reading those types of books. People have the choice to read a book or not so why bother even worry what other people are reading as long as they are happy with what they have. If a parent does not want a child to read a certain type of book that is their business but other parents might want their child to see what all is out there and develop their child's views on subjects. Everyone has different views and ideas. If everyone was the same the world would be boring and there would be nothing to talk about. By reading different types of books and listening to different types of music there is always something to talk about because not everyone knows the same subjects. Reading a new kind of book might even open people's eyes to what differences there are in the world. Children often times are more open to different ideas than adults are so if the books are not there for children to try and read they will never know what they like and do not like. A book a child likes may not be that another child likes or even an adult likes but that is normal, people are not the same. If everyone took the books or music off the shelf that they found offensive there wouldn't be very much of anything left on the shelves. Styles are most the time opposites, like comedy and sad books. Most people who would like comedy wouldn't like sad and visa-versa therefore they would take the other off the shelf so neither would have anything to read or listen to. Even with some of the best selling books people wonder why or how so many sold but that's just how it is. People out there like the book so if one person didn't like it all those people would never have known what that book is about and may have changed their life. Books can be very impactful in people's lives and if they never read that book the change would never have been made to their life. The world goes round because of differences and the world becomes a better place because of different ideas; everyone cannot be the same it just would not work. Libraries should not have to take books off the shelf just because someone found it offensive or did not like it. People have the choice to read books or not and different views and ideas are good to make things more interesting. Moreover, if everyone took books and music off the shelves they did not like there would not be very many books and music left. So if you run into a book or some music you don't like just ignore it, don't read it or listen to it; things will be much simpler in the long run, and libraries can remain a place for diverse perspectives and ideas to flourish for all who seek them.
149	3126	2	3	Real life is rated @CAPS1 so why pretend it's not? If a library feels that if a book is too graphic, a movie too violent or that music too aggressive then it's their own choice to remove it or not. It is true that it's pointless to try and censor the lives of kids and teenagers. Explicit content is all around not only in the media and literature. The never ending game of shielding this generations teenagers and children is already finished. In this point in time, the main focus of a lot of movies and music and books is something violent, aggressive, inappropriate, or explicit. The idea of removing these things from library shelves is pointless. There will always be violence and crime in today's world along with excessive swears and cuss words all around. It's acceptable that some parents don't want their children reading, watching or listening to something they don't or wouldn't approve of, but even if the kids are protected and home out in the world sometimes the parents won't be there.  Libraries are public places, and a percent of the audience would be upset, frustrated or angry if the books, music or movies they liked were no longer available due to the censorship. It @MONTH1 seem as if viewing, reading or listening to something violent or explicit, would have an effect on the listener, but it's not always the case. On the streets, at school, at the park and more places children and teens will be exposed to this type or explicit language so attempting to censor it in their reading and viewing material is just pointless.  In my experience I have grown up and been around people who have grown up listening to violent music, watching graphic movies and more explicit material and not been effected. I saw my first rated @CAPS1 movie when i was nine, so parents can give their kids somewhat of an age but at one point trying to censor anything is a waste of time. With schools now teaching their students the positives of being abstinent and about sexual diseases, students are more likely to refrain despite what they see in movies, read about, or listen to. Any child exposed to the internet could be subject to all kinds of inappropriate material, explicit content, bad language, cuss words, and disturbing images.  Real life is rated @CAPS1 so why pretend it's not? Trying to block the explicity and violence in the world is an endless battle. Certain things @MONTH1 go over the line, but others are just reenactments and previews of what's really going on in this world. Why would you hinder the real world away from children and teenagers? Movies have a rating and music @CAPS4 have an explicit content label so people should know what's appropriate for themselves. The first swear word a child hears probably wasn't in a song or movie and was probably somewhere in the real world, solidifying that exposure to such content is inevitable and attempting to shield them completely is ultimately futile.
150	3127	2	3	There are many books in the library that shouldn't be there. From books about racism, violence, or pornography I wouldn't want my young children to be able to take those type of books out of the library. A library in a school is a great way to help students with projects, essays, or just to read. If my child was in elementary or even middle school, I wouldn't at all want them to be able to check out a book about things they shouldn't even know about yet. If my teenager was in high school though, I wouldn't mind that because they are old enough to realize the things that actually go on in the world. They also could be doing a project over the wrongs of pornography, in which the library is better place to find a book then the internet that could take them to many bad websites. Since I go to my local high school I think its nice to be able to find anything I need in my library at school. It makes it easier to work on projects. Also in libraries there are a ton of music, movies, and magazines. If a library has educational music, why not keep them in there? If the music is rap, pop, or country they could just get it from Spotify instead of the library providing it. Magazines can also be educational. If you are doing a project on fashion a Vogue or Elle magazine would be excellent to help them find out some tips. Magazines can also have some inappropriate things in them. Since all they talk about in the media is sex, sex articles would probably be in the magazines. Whenever I look in magazines I just skip all of that nonsense they talk about and read the articles about clothes, food, and people. Exposing that to young children wouldn't be the best, but for teenagers they understand. Movies shouldn't be in the library unless they are educational too. There are a ton of Redbox around that those scary movies don't need to be in a library. In conclusion I think it all depends on what kinds of kids are going into the library. For young children, stay with the cartoon educational type things. For teenagers, keep it educational but be more relaxed about it. If something offends you, go have a talk with the librarian they would probably be happy to take it off the shelf.
151	3128	2	3	Books can be good things, but are they always good? They teach us things, entertain us, and are sometimes good pillows, but they can also be bad things. When a book is inappropriate for the reader, then it should not be on the shelves of the library. Music is the same way. The library should absolutely take the book off the shelf if it is found offensive by someone. Some books can be offensive in religious ways. A person might believe in something very strongly, and then a book goes and makes fun of it or trashes it in some way. Some might say that the person just shouldn't read the book, but if it were me, I would want the book gone so it didn't remind me of what it had said everytime I walked by it. Books can even be inappropriate for little kids. It might have language in it that the parents don't like. People have said that they should just make a section for those books to where little kids can't get to them, but you don't know what the childs parents are like. They could think a word is bad when you think it's fine. Everyone is different. Furthermore, a book might contain images not suitable for children. It comes back to what I was saying before, you can't just make a section for these books and say the heck with it. Libraries could even consider censoring some of their books. Some religions believe that some types of music is the devils music. I know from experience that my mother thinks that scream-o is the devils music. She says that it is not right for them to sing like that and that God wouldn't like it. Other peoples parents might feel the same way. Magazines might also have words or images in them that someone could take the wrong way. Although I don't believe libraries should remove them, but they should still watch who reads them. They could even put a little label on the front cover of the magazine that says it might not be suitable for everyone. Books are usually good things, although they can be very bad. In the end, libraries should consider censoring their books, or if the book is bad enough and gets enough complaints, take it off the shelves completely. Because of the potential harm and offense they can cause, libraries have a responsibility to carefully curate their collections.
152	3129	2	3	Just because I agree with something, do you have to agree too? Your cousin believing in one thing, means you have to believe in it also? No, not in my opinion, and I hope not in yours either. If you were to see something you find offensive does that have to mean it offends another around you? The world contains things that children agree with and parents do not, and this world consists of things that you like and others will not, but that does not make that item or that object invaluable or offending, and not the least bit inappropriate.  Objects containing so called offensive material are always going to exist in the world we live in, and they have for a while. They are going to be everywhere; in stores, in schools, inside, outside, they are all around, and there is no reason for them to be a problem. They will not disappear and that is nothing we want to have to worry about, that could become a criminal offence of any sorts. So why fight it, well I say we don't.  Do you think that seeing an offensive item makes an area all the less attractive and good intended? What if something you liked, was of an offence to another, does that make it all the more wrong for you to like it? Almost all the things and materials in this world are liked and disliked all based upon opinions. Nothing in this world exists without opinions. Life in itself can be an opinion.  I believe that if there is something in a library that is deemed offensive by one, it is not deemed offensive by all. Nothing should be removed from a shelf or a rack because another doesn't agree with it. Substitute other objects or ideas with this, if one person in the world was offended by another person would you just remove them from the human race? No, I sure hope you would not, but to some they might see that as their one resolution. Well me, I do not, and I'm a strong willed, strong opinionated person and to me that is all wrong.  Anything published or released to the world, to the public by someone means that is their way of expressing something, it is their way of living, and they have that right. That is who they are, and that is what they like, that is another person, anything we see or hear in this world is someone else because that has come from an individual who is equal to us, so why lessen there equivalence because its not the same way I feel? We may not all agree with their way of life, we may not agree with their choice of clothes, but how are we to know if we agree with their way of heart? No characteristic dictates the other characteristics of another, so why should an item?  A good thing to you could be a bad thing to another, and what if that disappeared? Taking a cd off a shelf will not vanish it from the world, it could be found somewhere else, but still that is like eliminating your hand because your fingers don't look like mine. Nothing can justify removing things from the stores and the world because one group of people don't understand it enough to feel the same and agree with it. Anything could be deemed inappropriate, but what if your vision of appropriate is anothers eye to inappropriate. Maybe there just is no line of the definition inappropriate, especially in the world we live in today.  If we start eliminating and removing everything we don't like, we would have nothing left, any and everything could be gone within a week or a month. People would take an inch to a mile, and erase everything, then we would start eliminating people we do not like, and it would all become a repeat. We learn about our history for a reason, does any of this resemble a situation or two the world has already been through? Erasing things from lives, have done no good before. If we start listening to the facts of people not agreeing with one thing, we will listen to the next, what happens when all the sudden the people come in again and say they do not like the women with blonde hair or the men with green eyes? The world will crash and burn before our eyes, and if I can identify these things at the age of fifteen, then some need to identify things at the age of fifty, accept that the world has its flaws too.  So just because I agree with everything I said, are you going to agree with it also? No I know you will not, but think about that when you expect others to agree with what you say or think. When I think of people reducing the things that they do not like, I can already see the world losing it's pathetic value it has earned, and we may not all be fond of this world but we cannot lose it. Eliminating the things you do not have a fatuation with will do no good, so maybe we should take into
153	3130	2	3	Offensive materials in libraries should not be taken off of the shelves because of their content. Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could obscure their message. People live around offensiveness every day on the street and in public places so censoring it in libraries would not protect anyone. Removing the books from libraries entirely could also interfere with research or school projects children have to work on for class. Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could potentially obscure a message or major theme of the novel. This style of writing can be seen in @PERSON1's novel To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 by @PERSON1 using terms that are offensive to @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to set the one of the racial tension in the south at that period in time. This type of censorship would also be detrimental if a reader studying the holocaust can not view pictures of death camps because of the graphic nature, the reader would not be able to understand the true horror of the camp without it. People live around offensiveness every day at home, on the streets, and even in school. A normal person encounters several occasions a day where they @MONTH1 hear profanities on the street from passing strangers or friends. Parents sometimes curse or use profanities in front of their children to prove a point or just by accident, and this would expose children to offensive behavior just as much as adults. Children are also exposed to profane language and behavior when they go to school and work around other children who might have offensive behaviors. Censorship of books in libraries could interfere with school or work related projects and research. Censorship could be an issue if a student could not get a book on a major war or event because of graphic nature, and this would hinder the students ability to efficiently complete their assignment. It could also cause problems if a teacher needs to rent a book that has slight profanity in it but is not able to because of the content, inhibiting her from teaching her students about the theme and lesson. Censorship of books based on the content should not be allowed in libraries. First of all trying to censor a novel might obscure the message or theme. Secondly people live around profanity every day so trying to censor it would not protect people because they have likely already heard what is said in the novel. Lastly censorship of libraries could interfere with work or school projects or research. If all libraries were censored it could potentially lead to several complications with workers, students, or people who are just looking for a good book to read, solidifying the point that literary censorship in libraries is detrimental to society.
154	3131	2	3	Libraries can seem boring, with endless aisles of books that might not grab your attention. After searching for what feels like forever, you might find a book with an intriguing title. But what if that book is full of inappropriate content? Who is responsible if someone opens it and reads it? Profanity, nudity, and crude humor are prevalent in media, including books. Some parents try to shield their children from these things by simply forbidding them, often without explaining why. If parents explained the reasons behind these restrictions, children might be less tempted to seek out the forbidden content. Parents should not only explain why certain content is inappropriate, but also be present when their children are in environments where they might encounter it. If a child is too young for certain content, they are likely too young to be browsing a library unsupervised. Ultimately, censorship should not come from libraries, movie producers, television programs, or record companies, but from the parents of the child, who can provide guidance and context appropriate for their child's development.
155	3132	2	3	Brian Censorship in Libraries Should there be censorship in Libraries? If this is a school library no, but if it is a public library, yes. I am going to tell you what I think about the books, movies and magazines. First I'm going to tell you about the books. I think the books in a school library should not be censored because parts of history get kind of gross and nasty. Then also sex ed books need to be in the library so people can read about it and not just go with what other people say. I don't think they should matter if its a nasty love book or a war book, all that matter is that they are reading. War books should not be censored because they need to let the reader know how war really is and its not a great place to be. Now in a public library yes because no parent would want their eight year old daughter reading about how to make drugs. I think they could put stuff in there about drug or alcohol perhaps but not go in depth, but keep it at a bare minimum. Next I'll talk about the movies they should have avalible in the library. I don't think anything over PG-13 at a school level. Exept like sex ed tapes and history movies, no free days in class, its got to be PG-13. In public I it should be G-PG movies. In those grade they really dont watch educational films it's all for fun films, so theres no reson for there to be anything worse than G-PG. Last I'm going to tell you about magazines. In school I don't think the magazines are a big issue. Just as long as theres not nudity and stuff like that. At the public leave again I think they should be, kids that age shouldn't be reading Playboy. They just need to have learning and for fun magazines. Should there be censorship in libraries? No at the school level and yes at the public level. School leave the book shouldn't public they should, should in both public movies, and magazines shouldn't in school and should in public, showing that censorship should be dependent on the type of library.
156	3133	2	3	To begin with I feel everyone should admire the libraries. I feel this way because at one point of time we didnt even have books let alone libraries to get books from. A library is a place that has a peacful and calm environment. People come to hang out at the library to collect good books, surf the internet, check out new music and aslo to relax. So to answer the question 'Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the selves at the library if found offensive?' @CAPS1, I believe if things are on the shelf that @MONTH1 come off offensive to people they should absolutely be removed. You shouldn't have to be in an environment were things are offending you. If things seem to come off offending, it will make indivuals stop coming to the library. This will make the library loose alot of business due to lack of service. The library should be a place that consist of love, peace and harmony. It should be a place were people should feel free and relieved from any stress. By seeing or hearing something that comes off very offensive will tend to bring confusion to the library. This also will make the librarians job much harder than what it should be, because they will have to address patron concerns. They will have to work harder to satisfy the difficulties that you seem to be having with the library. Something that would offend me in a library is some of the music they carry. Certain types of music shouldnt be found in a library. An example of some offensive music is the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' music, meaning the music with all types of different profanity. The music that is degrading women in a very disrespectful manner. Also the music that's making it seem cool to be violent. This will come off offensive to many men and women. Think about it who wants to listen to music thats makes women feel like their not worth anything and who wants to listen to music that's always talking about killing, fighting and gangs etc. People whould like to hear more soothing and relaxing music. The music that makes you happy no matter the mood your in. The library should just pick their music wisely so everyone can be well satisfied. In conclusion as stated the library is a great place to hang out and just to relax. It should never come off as a place with things that is offensive of so it should get removed. This would keep down less confusion and more people would continue to attend the library because they know what a nice place it really is.
157	3134	2	3	Some people might think that it is a good idea to censor things on library shelves. People might think that some of the material might be offensive or bad for the youth of the people who go to libraries. People might think it might be better to take the bad and offensive items off the shelf. I have a different opinion on the subject. I don't think anything should be censored in the library no matter if it deals with books, movies, music, magazines, etc. The real question is why should this material be censored or removed? The answer to that question is that it should not be censored or removed. The library is somewhere you can go to get information on just about anything you want. If these items are censored or taken off the shelves the resources would be limited and or no help to the people searching for the information. Another big problem with censoring or removing these materials is people might be missing out on a lot of knowledge that they have never heard of that might be bad or offensive. Such as slavery, the Holocaust taking over the Jews, and a lot of our world history. I feel strongly about people knowing about the world's past. Now what happens if the items are removed from the shelves of libraries? What are you going to do with the thousands of books that you can no longer read because it is offensive? We just can't get rid of them just like that. A lot of the offensive stuff is true or based on a true story such as Rosa Parks getting arrested because she refused to give up a seat to a white person. So removing these books would be pointless because wherever you put them people will just go there to get the material they want to know about. The most important thing about this is who wants these books censored or gone and why they want to remove them. Okay some books are bad and offensive but you have to look at it this way. People have their own choice on what they want to read, watch, or listen to. So just because some people don't like the material in a library doesn't mean everyone else doesn't like it. It's the people's choice not an opinion on what a couple people say. So at the end I think that books and other items in a library should not be censored or taken off the shelves. I believe that people have the right to read, listen, or watch whatever they want. I see it as people's opinions fighting opinions on removing the books. Also if people don't like the books at the library then no one told them they have to go meaning their opinion really doesn't matter, solidifying the idea that censorship limits access to knowledge and infringes upon individual choice.
158	3135	2	3	Okay, to me, people are way too moral in the modern world. I was taught that if you have a problem, keep it to yourself. Most everyone knows that censorship is a big deal, but it doesn't have to be. I know that some things are a little risque, but getting this out there quicker would be a better solution. You're probably asking yourself, how in the world can this be a 'better solution'? Let's talk about children and this content. If you get this out there quicker and subtly, the children won't see the need to find out what it is at a later age. If that was to happen, the consequences could be fatal, such as; fines, misdemeanors, respect, reputation, and even some time in jail. Tell the kids about murder, drugs, sex, and crimes in general; they are twice as moldable then as they are when they are older. Taking them off our shelves will only make us a nicer community, yeah I know what you're thinking, why not do that? If more people in your community are nicer, when a real threat comes, who's gonna help? The cops? Who knows, it takes a little bit for a squad car to get around, even longer if you're in a city. In that time, someone could have died, been robbed, and that same criminal gone. So, if we let this stay out on the shelves and so on, people will have the knowledge to see that using these to help people can be beneficial. Anyways, what I'm trying to say is, if you take this away from us, people will become weaker; if you let it stay, people will learn from it and use it for good. Ultimately, allowing this knowledge to permeate society empowers individuals to be more prepared and resilient in the face of real-world dangers.
159	3136	2	3	I have watched movies and seen books that I don't think kids should be exposed to. There are even songs that are inappropriate for children. Some parents are very strict about what their children watch, hear, read, or sing. My parents definitely wouldn't want me letting my children consume certain types of media. When considering music, books, or movies that should be kept away from children, those with bad language, violence, and bullying come to mind.  Bad language is inappropriate for children, especially those under ten. When a song with explicit lyrics comes on when young children are around, changing the station is the best course of action. If children hear this type of language, they may start repeating it. Books, songs, and movies containing violence should also be restricted. Exposure to violence can lead to children becoming violent themselves. No one should feel unsafe walking alone, fearing an attack. If you see someone reading or watching something you believe is inappropriate for them, you should discourage them from doing so, as violence is harmful for young children.  Furthermore, books, movies, or music that portray bullying should be removed. Bullying is never the answer, despite what some may believe. It is detrimental for children to learn about bullying. Bullying is wrong and can lead to serious consequences.  Have I ever thought about a book that should be taken off the shelf? Absolutely. The books with bad language, violence, and bullying should be removed. Children shouldn't be exposed to bad language, violence, or bullying in any form. These elements can have a negative impact on their development and understanding of the world, emphasizing the importance of protecting them from such content.
160	3137	2	3	Some books in libraries offend others, raising the question of whether they should be removed. Maintaining public self-control is crucial, so the continued publication of potentially offensive books warrants examination. Graphic and gory books, while potentially disturbing, could include warning symbols for sensitive readers. The reality that unpleasant content exists should be acknowledged. However, offensive material targeting race, religion, or other personal attributes presents a different challenge. Such content can incite unrest and protests, requiring authors to carefully consider potential consequences and avoid inflaming the public. False or inaccurate statements can fuel public curiosity and conspiracy theories, damaging an author's reputation and potentially leading to job loss, so ensuring factual accuracy is vital. Ultimately, authors bear a significant responsibility in navigating sensitive topics like race, religion, and factual accuracy. Striving for positive public reception and favorable press coverage should be a primary goal.
161	3138	2	3	In libraries, there should not be censorship on materials considering that it's an individual's decision to read what they prefer. There is no appropriate standard on what makes a book offensive to a group, so it should be undetermined as to what makes a book offensive. In a public library, many children, who the books are censored for, are with their parents. Parents should make an independent choice on what they can allow their children to read, understanding their child's maturity level. Letting society ban a book simply for the use of inappropriate materials is ridiculous. If an author spent time creating a story, it should be appreciated, and should not put on a list of no-nos. If a certain person doesn't like a book's reputation, all they have to do is not read it. Even in school systems, librarians are there to guide kids to read good books. If a child wants to read an inappropriate book, the librarian will most likely discourage him or her not to read it. In my experience, I wanted to read a book that my mother suggested to me, but as I went to the school library it turned out to be a censored book. I felt that my opportunity to experience the book was unfairly taken away from me. Some parents believe children should be ignorant about offensive things written in books, but honestly many of the same ideas are exploited to them everyday on television and internet. So trying to shield your child from the bad things might be a great thing, but the efforts are usually failed attempts. It also never occurs to the people censoring the books, that some people can't afford to buy the books they want to read. The libraries, for some, are the main means for getting books. To conclude there is very little reason to ban a book from the shelves. Many of the books banned have important lessons that can be obtained through reading it, providing different perspectives and fostering critical thinking. If a person doesn't like a book, the simplest thing to do is not to pick it up, thus preserving the freedom of choice for others.
162	3139	2	3	Honestly, there are a lot of books and magazines that need to be taken off the shelves. I can remember in the sixth grade going to the school library and picking up a book that not only told me what weed was, it told me how to grow it! Also, a lot of books refer to drugs and sex nowadays, and I absolutely hate it! The last book I checked out, even though it has been a while since I've checked one out, had enough references to sex that I could honestly say I thought I was reading a porn magazine. Our schools really need to watch what they put onto their shelves because sixth graders shouldn't even be able to know what weed is, let alone read about it in school! Maybe that's why kids get interested in drugs and alcohol at such an early age because the book I read didn't have any negative statements about the weed. What makes anyone think that a book like that would keep kids from doing drugs? Like I said before, a lot of books in schools and public libraries have books that refer a lot to drugs and sex. They have books now in our library that tell you what the drugs are, what kind of high it'll give you, and where you can buy the crap to make them! Okay, I know I'm in high school, but you shouldn't have books that seem like porn magazines. The book I read had pictures of positions in it! It broke everything down into details and even gave websites on the back of the book, and that, my friends, is not alright, and it's just sad. It is just starting to scare me about what kind of stuff my little brother and little sister could be reading. Doesn't it scare you? I know I don't want my siblings to be reading about drugs and sex in detail, let alone them reading about it at all. So just take the books off the schools and public libraries' shelves because hardly anyone will read them anyway, and if they do, it's by accident, like my encounters were. Ultimately, the presence of such content in school and public libraries raises serious concerns about the exposure of young children to inappropriate material, and removing these books would help protect them from potentially harmful influences.
163	3140	2	3	I believe that removing books deemed offensive from libraries should not be permitted. Individuals possess diverse tastes in reading material, and censorship infringes upon this variety. Furthermore, library collections often provide educational value, even if some content may be considered offensive by certain individuals; these materials can broaden our understanding of the world. Ultimately, personal preferences dictate reading choices; parents can guide their children's selections, while others retain the freedom to explore diverse materials. Personal taste plays a big role, so everyone is different.  Libraries should not be censored because of differing literary tastes. Some enjoy scary stories, others prefer romance, so a single standard is impossible. While offense is inevitable, tolerance is crucial.  Library books are usually educational. Libraries offer early learning resources, current event coverage, and historical accounts. Readers should not be overly sensitive about the content others choose.  Furthermore, parents can restrict their children's access to potentially offensive material. Restricting access for others infringes upon their freedom of choice. Promoting tolerance prevents the need for censorship in libraries.  In conclusion, libraries should remain uncensored to accommodate diverse tastes, preserve educational resources, and respect individual choice; understanding that books aren't always trying to offend people, but the ones that are, they are just trying to state their own opinion, which is very important.
164	3141	2	3	To @CAPS1 it @MONTH1 @CAPS2: @CAPS3 If I walk into a library, I want to be able to think I am in a peaceful place where I can find books that are helpful for what I need and are not harmful to anyone. Anywhere I go I want to feel like a free person and shouldn't have to worry about things that will hurt others or myself. People are people and everyone should be treated the same. It doesnt matter what color your skin is, the way you look, or how you talk. Everyone should be treated equally. I believe if there is something offensive in a movie, magazine, books, or anything to any kind of people it should be removed for good. It doesnt matter what the past was like. The present is all that matters and in my opinion everyone deserves the same.  I beleive that no one in this world should feel ashamed of who they are. If someone is @CAPS4 @CAPS5 they should be proud of it and shouldn't be afraid of negative things that would hurt their feelings. I think most people would agree @CAPS3 I say everyone in this world should be treated the absolute same. Negative things in books or magazines or anywhere should be removed for good. We do not need things like that in our world. That is what causes people to become crazy and get into gangs or into drugs. Our world shouldn't consist of bad things that will hurt the lives of others. Anything that is negative to a person or group of people shouldn't be allowed and should be thrown away. Innocent people do not deserve what people received in the past. The past has nothing to do with what is going on in the present, and we should strive for a more inclusive future. Right now people should be proud to be who they are and not scared of things like that. I treat people the way I want to be treated and that should go for everyone. Harmful things need to be removed from everything. We do not need things like that in our world. People should be able to live free and feel proud of who they are.  In conclusion I beleive that certain materials should be removed if they are found offensive. Everyone is who they are and that shouldn't have an effect on others and the way they live. People should feel proud to be here and not scared of things that could impact their lives forever. Harmful things are not good in this world and shouldn't have an impact on others. Everyone deserves the best and should be treated with care, not hatred, so that we can foster a more positive and accepting society for all.
165	3142	2	3	Comics, romance, adventure books, and mystery books are just the few different types of books out there as well as the magazines and music we listen to. With a little bit of everything, and whatever your passion is, we have that right in our local libraries to go look at or hear whatever pleases us but, some of the people that go there are not adults. Some of them are young children who are either checking out a book themselves or are simply with there parent/guardian. I believe that even though there are some books magazines, and music not attended for children, they still shouldn't be removed just because they are found offensive. Everyone once in their life had to atleast experience something unpleasant. But knowing our world today, we simply can not hide from those things but yet face them, we adults are old enough to just walk away from something we find offensive unlike what our children or other children can do. Sometimes, even children have to go through it as well. It's part of growing up and also a learning experience for all of us. If you already know what parts of the library have stuff children shouldn't see, don't bring your child to that area. And if it's possible, bring them to an area where they can sit and read there favorite books as well with you by there side where you can watch there every move. And at the same time, you don't have to take a chance at explaining something that you are not quite ready or sure that your child is ready to hear or see. Since it's impossible to hide things from your children that you are not wanting them to see and hear at the same time, that's a part of life. Even if they are still really young and ask what a certain thing is, we can simply turn there heads and make them get distracted by something else and pretend that we didn't hear what they said. But as your children get older, they should know right from wrong and know what things they can read and things they can't. Some of us are oblivious to the world around us and may not know that certain things can cause more harm than good, even like taking your children to the library. If you don't like a certain thing there or know that there is going to be something you simply do not want your child to see or hear, then don't bother taking them with you on your next visit and go another time when your child is with a babysitter or take a chance into bringing them with you an expect the unexpected when it comes to offensive items at the library. Ultimately, while libraries should maintain a diverse collection, parents hold the primary responsibility for guiding their children's choices and shielding them from potentially harmful content, ensuring a balanced approach to intellectual freedom and parental guidance.
166	3143	2	3	To start, if any materials in the library such as books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive I believe that they should still remain on the shelves. This book or music might be offensive but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. People have all the freedom to read, listen or watch anything that is appropriate to them. I believe it should all be up to the individual to choose what they should do with what might offend others. Also from my own experience I have read a book about African Americans in the stages of our history where they were slaves and were hung for their punishment. It might offend some that their local library having a book on such a terrible topic but it is found that it is part of history and others might find it interesting to go back a learn more information. It does not have to mean that they are racist or trying to offend you they would just like to learn more about our history. Each person has had topics that offend them but the libraries can not make all happy. If you chose to pick a book, watch a movie, or listen to music that might offend someone then it shouldn't be removed, if you would like to read, watch or listen to anything that might offend someone then it should be up to you to decide what to do about it. Therefore, I conclude that if any books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive they should remain on the shelves. Everyone might have their own opinion or have their own ideals that offend them but it is our job to let those people choose their liking of anything open in our local libraries, allowing access to diverse perspectives. It is for their own benefit, not for yours, and it is up to you to decide whether or not to come about the situation. Libraries should not be held responsible and have to remove anything open to the people that might just be part of our background.
167	3144	2	3	Censorship is used in the media to prevent people from being offended by what they see or hear. Although censorship isnt usually a bad thing, it is sometimes over-used. Not everyone has the same views and morals, what may be considered appropriate for some people, may be viewed differently by other cultures or religions. In my personal opinion if you find something to be offensive, instead of demanding it be removed or censored, simply do not watch, or read it etc. Obviously if the content was published in the first place it appeals to some audience. No one is forceing people to read or watch things, that is why there is something called viewers disgression. If everything that was considered offesive to a certain individual or group where censored , there would be no art. In America, we have freedom of speech, the freedom to write or animate to express any belief we choose. To censor things out is condraticary to that amendmant. For example the censorship of useing the word 'God' in vain on television. I myself find this to be excessive because it doesnt apply to my beliefs . Although the program ' The Secret Life Of The American Teenager' protrays people of my age and nationality getting pregnant and doing drugs. Even though I find this offensive and sterotypical, instead of demanding it be removed, I simply don't watch it. I am not saying that I am totally against censorship of certain things, like nudity on television. Although if something is censored simply because of a belief, or moral, or worry for a one's children to be subjected to it,that is blowing censorship out of proportion. If you find something offensive just keep yourself and your children away from it, and allow others to make their own choices, reflecting the diversity of thought and experience that freedom of expression is meant to protect.
168	3145	2	3	Censorship in libraries is not necessary. No reading material should be taken off the shelf. Every book has a different experience that can help a child learn. If the guardian of a child believes that a certain book is bad or offensive, then the guardian can forbid the child to read it. If people began to take away options on reading materials some kids will refuse to read at all. Every person is different and likes an option to pick a book that they can get into. Censoring books at a library is pointless; you take away options, and the experience to learn from certain books. Every book has a different plot and a different moral. Each story in its own way teaches the reader a moral. When you start to remove books from libraries you are taking away the chance for a student to learn a certain moral from that book. You are sort of in a way trying to hide away reality when taking away certain books. No book should ever be taken off the shelves of libraries. Every book removed from the shelves is another learning experience taken away. If there is a book that a child's guardian disapproves of, keep it up to them to forbid their child not to read it. A book is simply a way to learn and explore the different things in life. Censoring at the library can only keep kids away from the books for so long. Every child deserves the chance to read any book they want, unless a guardian forbids it. It is not up to libraries whether a book is offensive or bad. That is solely based on the reader's opinion, and everyone's opinion is different. So again, if a guardian really wants their child to stay away from certain reading material they can forbid their child by themselves. When libraries begin to censor books they take away the option to pick books. When you limit the themes of books in your library, some kids will just pick up fewer and fewer books as time goes by. Everyone enjoys a different kind of book; leaving options open gives everyone the chance to find a book they like. Although some stories may seem like a bad option, it is not until the reader has begun to read that he or she can figure that out. Leaving options open for students is the best idea, because more kids will actually read. All in all libraries should not censor books or any kind of reading material, thus fostering a wider engagement with literature. Everyone is different even when it comes to reading a book. People like their options to be open and at a wide range. Each book tells a different story and teaches a different moral. So leave the options open to the children and let them learn from the stories they choose. Some books help teach a moral or get a point across. Also some books help prepare a person for the outside world. Taking away certain reading materials is taking away the chance for a child to learn the things that are actually going on around them. In conclusion censorship is a bad idea and should be left to the guardian of a child, allowing children to explore diverse perspectives and form their own opinions through reading.
169	3146	2	3	In my own personal opinion no I don't think that any books should be banned from a public library. The authors of books have freedom of speech so yeah some books might offend people but if it offends them they should try stay away from that books or magazines. I think that if certain books get banned from the library then you won't be able to buy them in stores anymore because the stores will banned them as well. In my personal opinion no I don't think that any book should be banned from the public library, especially since you can't judge a book by its cover. You don't know if the book is going to offend you until you read it. After you read it or you're in the middle of reading it and it offends you, you should take it back to the library and get a new one. In my own personal opinion no I don't think that books should be banned from the public library. Because a lot of books that do offend people are the one's that teach us about history, and limiting access to these books would ultimately hinder our understanding of the past.
170	3147	2	3	In my opinion, I think that some books probably should be removed from the shelves if some of the books are found offensive. Some of the movies and books people find offensive can be pretty bad and say nasty things and stuff like that, especially if they promote harmful stereotypes or discrimination. Some music can be pretty offensive too because it can say nasty things and things like that, but not all music is bad. It depends on the kind of music you like to listen to if it says nasty things because there are many different types of music to listen to. Ultimately, the decision of what is acceptable often comes down to individual values and community standards.
171	3148	2	3	I believe that there shouldn't be any censorship in libraries. The reason why I say that is because of our first amendment which is freedom of speech; we should be able to put anything in books, magazines, music, movies, etc. The other reason why we shouldn't take them off the shelf is because we should be able to tell if the book is good enough for your age or your viewings, depends on your point of views. My first reason is the first amendment which is freedom of speech. The reason why I say that is because we should be able to put whatever in our books that expresses our feelings in any way, shape, or form. This freedom allows for diverse perspectives and artistic expression. Also, if we start taking stuff away because of censorship in books, it will go farther than that, and it will come to a point where the first amendment will become obsolete. This erosion of freedom is a dangerous path. In my culmination, I have made my point that there shouldn't be any censorship in anything because of the first amendment, which protects the free exchange of ideas. I also said the reason why we shouldn't have censorship is because it's another way to express yourself or your point of views, contributing to a more informed and understanding society.
172	3149	2	3	You know when you find a library book on the shelf and discover that the content in the book are not words that are appropriate for children to read. Or when you go to copy something and you notice a magazine on the table and find out that the cover of the magazine has an image not for the young mind to see. Or a movie or music that you see and the content from them shocks you and makes you think that they bleep those words. I see it as better to have offensive items such as: books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. removed from the shelves, because those words and pictures will poison the minds of children and children learn from the world around them; stuff like this will make the child think that's how you are supposed to act and talk. Here are two examples of why they should be removed from the shelves: music and magazines. First, in dealing with music, children will imitate acts they see and the words they say. One good example is rap music: their songs have cuss words in them, and believe me when I tell you this, I have to constantly correct kids at my school saying cuss words like the n- and f-word and many more, and seeing some boys' underwear, because they think they are being thugs just because they have their pants sagging low. It drives me crazy and makes me think why are their parents letting their children do this. In the next paragraph I will talk about magazines. Second, with magazines, some of the images they use on their covers and pages are something that aren't meant to be seen where children read. An example for this is when I went into my school library's copying room to copy an article from a magazine, I found a magazine on the table and it showed three of the cast members from *Playboy* in their birthday suits. I thought what in the world is this doing at my school; they shouldn't have something like that in a place where kids are in a learning environment. Why on earth did they send this to a school for crying out loud. What do they think, it won't bother any kids' parents about it? I sure would be furious about it if I found out that my child had something like that at their school. In conclusion, this is why they should be removed from the shelves so the children don't see them; removing these items will help protect children from inappropriate content and allow them to develop in a more positive environment.
173	3150	2	3	Freedom of press is a right not many countries have. America is the land of the free. To some, having this much freedom causes great things to happen. Without the freedom of press, many of the most classic modern literature would not exist and their messages would be unknown. To censorize the right to write freely about ones outlook on the world or government or anything means taking away imagination and in some cases statistics and events that relate to the past. Before todays technology, books were one of the only ways to obtain knowledge, and the process to make and publish a book took so long that it was an honor to recieve one of the few copies produced. People have a craving for information, they like to learn and advance. If all books that were found 'offensive' are stripped off the shelves, information is slowly taken away and the enjoyment of reading would be gone. In the brilliant novel, Fahrenheit 451 a man who lives in a distopian society discovers the lack of literature. All books found in homes are immediatly taken out and burned in the streets for all to see. Children found it entertaining and adults did nothing. The man goes through the novel with a secret stash of books of his own. Once discovered he is on the run to protect his precious knowledge the government tries so hard to keep from the public. Censorship would create nothing but chaos and distruction as in the novel. Having the right to know about your countries history or what is going on in your current government is critical in shools and colleges. Parents often find offense in the authors schools choose to make students read, saying their ideas and ways of thinking are to single minded and wrong. Students need books to grow and learn and if every person chose one book to take off the shelf perminatly, there would be no more books. Eventually all information would come from what one would know before the books were banished and in time gone for good. Books are a history in themselves, no one wants to hear the raw truth of certain topics such as slavory or the possibility of a complete government take over. In order to avoid hearing of this one could simply chose a more ficition novel in which to escape into a fantasy of their own. No one can change history, however they can exagorate certain events and without the actual book or cite it came from, one could completely alter the publics view and thoughts of the past. Should one take offense to a certain book, they have their own freedom to write a negative blog or report on it. Writing is a gift few have naturally and to be able to show off ones talent is a privlage. Books help people escape the harsh world we live in, or help them gain more knowledge. Censorship is irrevelent, for having all forms of music, movies and magazines stripped of the truth, what does that leave? People always strech the truth or tell a 'white lie' however most information is factual. The freedom to write and make books and music and movies is not all about entertaining people. The messages behind said 'offensive' material could be quite strong and though the author might be long gone, his or her message could live on for decades, meaning limiting this access is detrimental to growth and understanding.
174	3151	2	3	The entertainment for children and adults consists of movies, music, sports, video games, and reading. Books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from any shelf at any time. Libraries censor some material because of violence or inappropriate material. Children should have the right to read, listen, or watch whatever they want to because it's their life. Books, magazines, music, and movies can teach young people about life and the writers, artists, directors, and actors have worked extremely hard on entertaining the people. The materials found 'offensive' should not be removed. These materials can be found helpful to others. Reading material can help a young person with life. If the reader is having problems and needs help, it is possible the book he/she is reading @MONTH1 may help them in the thinking process on what they should do. The books, movies, and music have been made by extremely hard workers, so why take away their hard work by removing their material just because a couple of people have found it offensive. One of the many times i went to the library I was looking for a book I had read before but I could not find it. I could not find it because someone else found it inappropriate and had asked that the book be removed from the shelf. This hurt me because that book was one of my favorite books to read. Some books found 'offensive' or 'inappropriate' and taken off the shelves could be another person's favorite book to read, providing comfort or escape. Why take it off the shelf? People are being too much self-centered. They care about themself and that is it. The material being taken off the shelves should be put back on the shelves for the readers who find the material entertaining. If a parent does not want their child reading a certain book then they have the authority to take the book away from that child, not the shelves. Freedom of the @CAPS1 FIRST AMENDMENT states that the anybody has the right to write whatever the he/she wants to write. If we keep taking books, magazines, music, or movies off of the shelves then we're going to get to the point to where there are no books on any shelf, and censoring expression in this way is detrimental to our freedom.
175	3152	2	3	I do not believe that books should be removed from the shelves due to something offensive. Libraries are a very important aspect of life for most people nowadays. Mainly because where I live, our city is working on a new plan to close the library nearby. For me and my friends, the library is very important because we do not have a computer in our home. The library has the internet and older books with information on the city. Living in the society that we have now, not every household can afford a computer with internet. Me myself living in one of those households. The library is a great quiet place to get your work done. It also provides the internet that people can't afford and need for everyday life. Every job application or school assignment is no longer on paper, but online. Being a 10th grade student we have a lot of projects to do that require old books on the city and history. If they remove certain books off the shelves I will not be able to find important information that I need. Also, I know that every person has their own opinion on what is offensive to them, however if everyone found something offensive in the book, movie or magazine does that mean it should be removed? If that happened there would be a very limited supply of books. I have a friend who is mixed with Mexican and sometimes she finds slavery very offensive, but to me I believe that it is important for me to learn about my history. Proving that something that might be offensive to one person will not be offensive and maybe very important to the other. In conclusion, I disagree with books being removed from the shelves due to offensive content I believe is wrong. Every person is different and finds different things offensive, but things should not be taken away from another person who may need it.
176	3153	2	3	Everyone has a right to read, listen, or watch what they want. Sometimes it's not always up to them. For example rated-R movies, most children under 17 cannot watch them. Either its a law or the parents have made it a rule. Music I think is different. Some songs have a bad influence on children whether it has to do with violence or cussing, certain songs like that still give kids the wrong message. Libraries should not have those kind of books, music, movies, magazines, etc. If people want to view those kind of things that other people find 'offensive' they should buy them on their own time. Not everyone has a great sense of humor so things that some people may find funny other people get offended by. Even if libraries had anything that would offend someone else, it would be the readers choice to pick a book they want to read. Sometimes it may be better off if the children read these articles by themselves so it'd save time from having parents explain it to them later. They might ask a lot of questions the parents might not even have the answer for. For example, when my brother watched a rated-R movie. In my brother's younger years he was always curious and asked a lot of questions all the time. Sometimes my mother didn't know how to respond so she'd change the subject. Well, everyone knows the same old question 'where do babies come from?'. That's the kind of question my brother was curious about. My mom never bothered to answer that question, but if she did she would make up some story. My brother was smart enough to know that what he was being told wasnt accurate at all. Finally one day he got nosy and took one of my mom's movies without asking. It happen to have the answer to his question. He was shocked and disgusted at the same time yet he was glad to know he finally found the answer my mom wouldnt give.  In this situation I am somewhat neutral. I dont object to having things that might offend other people be removed from book shelves but on the other hand it might not be a good thing to put 'offensive' things in certain libraries where children can get to them. Perhaps it's what makes things not boring and makes it more interesting to the reader. Not everyone has the same opinion on things. It may be a good thing to have these types of books whether its stating a fact or stating their own opinion. Everyone does have a right to say their opinion and there is nothing wrong with giving informational facts in articles or movies either.  The bad thing about having any 'offensive' things in libraries may not be a smart idea if it's where most children get there books. Parents can always have a say in what kind of book their children read or what kind of movies they watch. Some parents might not want to go through all the questions the children ask and give something to them that will explain it better for there understanding, while other parents dont want their children to see or know of any sort of things that may be 'offensive' until their old enough to understand it better and are mature about those things. So in some cases it might be bad idea for things that only an adult should know be on book shelves in a library where a child might get ahold of it.  The quotation ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' by Katherine Paterson has its own opinion. The quotation is basically saying if even a parent doesnt want their child to read something 'offensive' if that parent reads it that sometime their children have a right to know. If the child has tooken anything like that off a shelf that once they know they will not ask anymore questions. Therefore, striking a balance between protecting children and upholding the freedom to access diverse materials remains a complex challenge with valid arguments on both sides.
177	3154	2	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think that it is wrong to remove offensive and other non offensive books from the shelves in the library just because one or two students do not like them or do not want to see others reading them. Somethings are ok for reading and learning although they are indeed offensive; it is ok for these matrerials to be left on the shelves if it will be used for a good purpose such as learning and not just for fun. It is important for readers to be exposed to a broad spectrum of reading materials and different perspectives. Not only should they be exposed to some materials that are not so clean and normal but they should be introduced to things such as foreign writing. If we took everyting off the shelves that was a slight bit offensive or was not completely suited for readers would there be many books that would keep peoples atention? In conclusion I strongly believe that these materials should be left on the shelf. These materials are important for learning in some cases and keep the readers attention, and removing them limits exposure to diverse ideas. Keep these items on the shelves!
178	3155	2	3	The censorship in libraries should be age-appropriate. Children of the age @NUM1 to @NUM2 should be able to read books with profanity. They should be mature enough to get through a book that has name-calling and uses profanity without laughing or taking offense. Children that are @NUM3 should not have books in their libraries with much of this profound language. They are young and should not be exposed to the fact that there are people that use these words to express feelings or name-calling. They should ideally hear and see very little of it at this age. When they get older, they are supposed to be used to this, and if they don't hear it as much, then a point of censorship in the libraries is appropriate. With children that are younger than @NUM4 years of age, they should not read or see things that have profanity or bad scenes unless their parents allow them. We cannot control what parents let their children do, but we can in the schools and in the public libraries; therefore, libraries should adopt a tiered approach to censorship based on age.
179	3156	2	3	I am a citizen of @LOCATION1 and I believe that the censorship on the material in libraries is not good but it could be better. It should be an age limit on certain books and magazines ect. in the library. Somethings younger children shouldn't be able to read because of the maturity level. I remember taking my little sister to the public library and she got a book and began to ask me some words that she shouldn't even be hearing about now. This made me think about the types of materials easily accessible. On the other hand, those books @MONTH1 be needed. Some people need those types of books and magezines for research papers and things like that. Now I consider myself a young adult and I believe that other children my age could read about different things and know whats right from wrong. Its also up to the parent or gaurdian of the child , if you feel that you dont want your child to read anything thats not appropriate then go with them to the library. But then some children dont have a mature parent or gardian that would tell them what to read and what not so thats when the library should do something about the censorship on the books. This is especially true for children who may not have strong guidance at home. Well I jus wanted to write you this because like I stated before the censorship on the books, movies, music, magazines, ect. in the library is ok but it could be jus a little better. There should be a certain age when a child reads or see's certain things. But you can't just take all the books and things out the library that are not appropriate because some people actually need the books. Thats why I believe that it would help if the library had a age limit or made certain things for mature audiance only, striking a balance between access and age-appropriateness.
180	3157	2	3	If something is to be found offensive, than it should certainly be removed from the shelves. When parents send or take their children to a library, they do not expect their child to be able to pick up something that is not appropriate. Some items often offend someone's beliefs and be rude. Public libraries are just that, public. Everything there will be seen by the public and large masses of people. No one should have to worry about being offended when they walk into a place of learning and knowledge. Parents do not want their child going to the library and picking up rude materials. Even if the child does not check the book or magazine out, who is to stop that young, impressionable mind from flipping through the pages. Perhaps he or she reads something that his or her parents did not intend on teaching them for some time. Books now have a lot of crude text and humor. If there is a topic that a younger individual is not mature enough to understand, he or she often get the wrong impression or ideas about the subject. If a kid is rumaging through the more adult section of the library, they might be expossed to some information they are not ready for. Offensive language can be present in the books and now the young person will see them and try to use the words or phrases. If a child read something about sex, he or she might be curious or confused, and ask their parents about it. The parents on the other hand, might not have wanted their child to know about the topic at such a young age. At that point there would be no turning back. Parents would have to explain things that are too mature for some young minds. Parents have every right to deny minors and children certain materials, but if the books are out in open, who will censor what is looked at by whom. Libraries need to put serious thought into what is on the shelves, no matter what form the information is in. People often think just because the story was in a book, than of course it can't be real. Some reckless senarios are played out in movies. Those movies are watched by people of all ages. If an impressionable teenager watches a movies that has offensive language or violent scenes, that teen might act upon what they've seen. Since the public library is indeed public, the materials it offers to people should not be offensive. All sorts of individuals walk into a library and look around. No one should ever walk out a library with the feeling of being offended. No parent should have to worry about what their child might pick up. Libraries should not cause worry or harm in any way, and by carefully selecting appropriate materials, libraries can ensure a safe and welcoming environment for everyone.
181	3158	2	3	I feel that they shouldn't be removed due to the fact that somebody else @MONTH1 like that movie, book, music, or magazine. Just because we might not like it doesn't mean there isn't somebody out there that does. Everything should be in the library because there are different people, and not everybody likes the same things. The library is supposed to have everything, so if we decided to take something off the shelf because one or a couple more people don't like something or what's being displayed out to people, it wouldn't be right. I have been to the library looking for a movie or a book that I like or want to see, and it has not been there; I have gotten mad for that. So I feel as if it's not right nor fair. Everybody should have their right to whatever it is that they read or like to watch. Even though there are certain books or movies out there that children should not touch, I still feel as if they shouldn't remove anything off the shelves, because limiting access for some limits opportunities for all, and a library should strive to offer a wide range of materials for everyone's interests.
182	3159	2	3	Hi my name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 and I'm here to talk about why I think we should have these certain materials in the libraries. Why I think these materials should stay well because, for @CAPS3, let's say it's a certain movie or song or book or whatever, just that one thing you were looking for for ages and you couldn't find it in any other store and you just happened to go to the library just to look, even though you know it's not there, but you're just looking and you end up finding whatever it is you were looking for. And what if you wanted to look for a mystery book and only the library had that book you were looking for? I can think of a lot of reasons why we need certain materials. I guess that about sums that up for me. And in conclusion, put yourself in the same shoes or even my shoes. What would you do? Would you let them remove those materials, or would you fight for them to stay so that others can also experience the joy of discovery and access to information?
183	3160	2	3	What is your opinion on reading materials? Should people be able to read what they want, or should we limit them to what they read? Every library has different choices. They can say you can't get this without an adult, or they can just let you check it out and take it home. I have read many different things in my lifetime so far. I have read books that people have told me were not appropriate, and then nothing bad was in there. Most books even if they say one to two choice words it turns into an adult book. I think it should be up to the reader, if they can handle a book or not. Everyone reacts to things differently. Let's take people in my age group, for example, some of the boys are still immature, and think it is funny to act out. Those are the kind of people that cannot handle what we call 'adult' material books. Most girls are in the stage where they are maturing, still immature, but working their way up the scale. They would be able to handle something in the adult material category. The reader is smart enough to know what he or she can or cannot handle. If we take peoples choice away what are they going to have? You would make them feel more like they are being babysat because they have to take their parents to the library, and say hey mommy and daddy pick me out a book because I am not eighteen and cannot pick one. I would not like that. Being one that reads a lot I know my family is pretty busy and would not be able to find time to ride with me to pick a book. Therefore, i would not be able to read as much. I mean what do you think? Which side would you choose? Everything is a personal opinion. It is all about what you as a reader is comfortable with. Do you want to decide for yourself or have someone with you every step of the way? Some people are just too busy to even try to fit it in their schedule to go to the library. Others just want to have the freedom to read what they want to read. Why stop someone from getting smarter? A child will only learn more by challenging themselves. Why not let them challenge themselves in a good book, that they got to pick out. What do you think? I believe that restricting access to reading materials ultimately hinders personal growth and intellectual exploration. Allowing individuals to choose their own books fosters a love of reading and empowers them to make informed decisions about what they consume.
184	3161	2	3	I believe that libraries shouldn't be censored because people take offense to something. Everyone should be able to read, research, or watch anything they want at a library. I say this because everyone takes offense to something, If people can't find what they're looking for then why go to the library, also everybody likes different things. I'll support them in the following paragraphs. Have you ever read or seen something that you took offense to, you or others? normally when someone takes offense to something they try to get rid of the thing offending them. If people where to take away things that offended them in libraries what would be left of the shelves? dust? Because there are many things that people take offensive, everyone is different. This is one reason I support no on censorship because there would be nothing left. Books on history, different cultures, or even certain viewpoints could all face removal if offense is the primary criterion.  Also everyone tends to like many different things. I @MONTH1 like something you could possibly hate, should it not be allowed in a library because you don't like it? No, because something you like could be taken away by someone else. So if everyone tried to take away the thing they don't like this would be another thing were nothing would be left. I think that because if we combined everyone's things that they hate, it would most likely be everything. A library's purpose is to offer a broad range of perspectives and cater to diverse interests, which would be impossible with constant censorship.  These two subjects bring me to my last reason, if people can't find what they want. Because it was taken away, why come to a library? People would just stay home to read what they like on the internet and libraries would become empty like there shelves. Then it was a waste of money to make the building, purchase the books for people, and hire librarians. That's wasted tax dollars we could have used for something better. A library without diverse content becomes irrelevant, failing to serve its community.  After reading all my reasons and opinions I hope you can agree on not having censorship in libraries, because everyone is offended by something, everyone likes different things, and no one would use a library if what they liked wasn't there. Some people @MONTH1 disagree with me because they're one of these people being offended or not liking something. But say no to censorship, let our libraries do what they're for, allow people to read, research, and watch what the want. By protecting the freedom to access information, we ensure that libraries remain vital centers of learning and discovery for all.
185	3162	2	3	Censorship is one of the most broken laws in @LOCATION1. It is illegal to censor any publication such as books, magazines, music or movies. Censorship most often occurs with books in a school setting. Censorship should no longer be tolerated because it affects the writers, school system and escpecially readers. In the @ORGANIZATION1 every person has the right to express their feelings and opinions on any topic that they want to. School systems are taking away that right by not allowing them to have a certain book in a school. Schools should be a place for either all books or a place for no books at all. The faculty of a school does not have the right to decide what books are allowed in their school based on their own ideals. It is not fair to the writer to be descriminated agianst, and that writer must have the right to have their book read in any setting. The writer pours their heart and soul into their work, and censorship denies them the audience they deserve.  The next group that censorship within a school system affects is the school system itself. If a school is allowed to take away one right of a group of people without punishment, then they might start taking away other rights. In general school systems and teachers are power hugnry leaders of the student body of a school. They make rules just to display their power over students, and take away many of their rights. If schools are allowed to continue censoring books, then this could lead to a downward spiral of all being censored. As Katherine Paterson once said,'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children...take off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove the book I abhor...then you have exactly the same right...And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' The government of the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to crack down on school censorship because it is unconstitutional. This unchecked power undermines the very foundation of a free and open educational environment.  The last major group of people that censorship within a school system is the potential readers and students. Censoring a book is taking that persons ability to learn about, and understand a certain topic that was censored. Students within a school must have the right to read what they want to read regardless of the schools beliefs and ideals. By limiting access to diverse perspectives, schools are hindering students' intellectual growth and critical thinking skills.  In conclusion, censorship in any setting, but escpecially in school must no longer be tolerated because it affects writers, school systems, and potential readers. Schools are taking away the constitutional right of all potential readers. The government of the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to crack down on the unlawful practices occuring in schools, around the country, everyday, to uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and ensure a well-rounded education for all students.
186	3163	2	3	What is this world coming to? We have stooped to the level of installing offensive materials in libraries where anyone can check them out. Being a daughter and teenager myself, I personally have had the experience of reading some of these offensive books and magazines. The sex, drugs, and violence used to create a story, have destroyed the minds of our youth. I strongly feel this disturbing and destructive material should be removed from the shelves of libraries.  I do not question whether children and teens should read, but rather what they read. I agree reading helps our youth learn and excel in schooling, but offensive books and magazines put nasty ideas into their minds and distort their way of thinking. The more our younger generation reads about these ugly things, the more curious they become. I feel they will eventually let curiosity get the better of them.  Many would say that experiencing activities such as sex and drugs is all apart of growing up, but I disagree. Trying any one of these harmful activities portrayed in certain library materials could put you and your health in severe danger. It only takes one time to become pregnant or become addicted to drugs.  To better prove my point, think of your favorite book. Did you look up to any of the main characters? Did you want to be just like him/her? Well it seems to me that this malicious material makes the main character and hero of the story a bad role model. They might save the world and be a hero by day, but authors and producers make sure they include their night life in the story as well. This tells our children that it is okay to do these things, when it is the exact opposite.  I stand by my opinion and believe offensive books, magazines, and movies should be removed from the shelves of libraries. This material plants a bad seed in the mind of our youth, and it leads them to believe everyone, including their heroes in books and movies, engages in dangerous behaviors. Sex, violence, and drugs are not what this world was made for, and we should protect our children from content that suggests otherwise.
187	3164	2	3	People think that graphic images or words are going to change the outlook there younger child has on alot of topics. But really the kids wont remember half of what they read or see so does it really matter? Well according to some people it does which i can understand but I will have to go with the side that it does'nt matter to. Becasue its not like there not going to find out about bad language or sex so I say there should be no restrictions on books, music, movies, magazines, tv shows, ect. The fact of the matter is that people or parents get to offended or complain cause there little @PERSON1 said a curse word in front of them. Or becasue some of the material in the show or magazines are to offensive towards people with disabilities, races, ect. When really all of this is just humor none of it is the network or authors being serious. Authors works arent to be shunned apon but to be read and for people to learn from that book or just have a good time reading it. So instead of outrage, we should view these materials as opportunities for discussion and education. Through all of this you should know by now that I don't think that books should be taken off the shelf just becasue little kids parents are ashamed of what there kid read. Casue like I already said there are gonna find out about this stuff eventually. So no need getting mad over it. And if we got rid of all the more mature books what kind of books would all of us more mature kids and people have to read. Casue I'm pretty sure I dont want to read about a magical friendly dragon finding its way home. Therefore, censorship restricts not just children but everyone, hindering intellectual exploration and personal growth.
188	3165	2	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1. I am a student here at @LOCATION1, and it has come to @CAPS2 attention that the @ORGANIZATION1 is thinking about taking books they find offensive out of the library. I think this is wrong. If everybody at @LOCATION1 took the books we found offensive off the shelves and threw them away, we would be left with no books to read.  I also think that no one person should have the right to decide what books are too offensive for me to read. I am sixteen years old and responsible enough to make @CAPS2 own decisions about what is too offensive for me to be reading. If I feel I should read books that others @MONTH1 find offensive then, why does that concern you? Just because I want to read the book does not mean you have to.  Also, I think that having books that might be a little offensive makes that book more interesting. If you take every offensive word out of a book, chances are it is going to be hard to sit through it. If you take all offensive books from the library, kids will be even more discouraged about reading, and I know that is not what @LOCATION1 is looking to do.  If you think that books are that offensive, try walking down the hallways. This is a @ORGANIZATION1. Kids cuss all the time, and talk about dirtier stuff than in any book I've ever read. If your looking to make children more innocent, then taking all of our books out of the library is not the way to go about it. So, please reconsider this decision, as limiting access to diverse viewpoints will ultimately hinder, rather than help, our development as thoughtful individuals.
189	3166	2	3	Every author has an intended audience when they are writing a book, and they write about what they think is appropriate for that certain audience. Unfortunately, sometimes other people that are not intended to read the book actually do read it even though it might not be something that they are supposed to be reading. When an author writes a childrens book, it is meant for a child to read, not an adult. Also when an author writes a romance novel, it is meant for people who can comprehend what the author is talking about and can act maturely while reading it. Although some novels might not be appropriate for certain people, censorship in libraries is not the way to fix that, and it is a big mistake. As humans we are given certain freedoms, and one of those freedoms is the freedom of press. Authors should be able to write about whatever they choose to write about. If they choose to write about subject's that are not appropriate for all age groups they still have the right to have their books in libraries. Even though everyone isn't supposed to read them, certain people are. If you take those books away because your scared that a child might get ahold of one, then your taking away what certain people enjoy reading. Due to the fact that different books are intended for different age groups, libraries have different sections filled with a variety of authors. They have a children's section made primarily for children, an adult section with books that only adults are supposed to read and a teen section for everyone in between. By having sections within them, libraries are trying to keep people reading what they were intended to read without censoring or taking away people's favorite books. Having sections in libraries is a happy medium between letting anyone read whatever book they would like no matter how inappropriate it might be, and cutting out certain books all together. If a person is an adult, they should be allowed to go to the library and get whatever type of book, magazine, music, or movie that they want. If a kid's parent is okay with them checking out or looking at certain things then it shouldn't matter to anyone else if they think that the material is offensive. Instead of censoring what movies, books, magazines, or music that libraries have, there should be a certain age when someone can come in without a parent and check out whatever they would like. If a person is under that age then their parents should be present while they check out so they can approve of what their child is checking out. Censorship in libraries is ultimately pointless and shouldn't even be considered. Whether some people find certain material offensive or not, there are other ways to get that material so there really is no point to censoring anything in libraries, and that focus should be directed towards the other means of access.
190	3167	2	3	I think that all offensive materials should be removed from libraries so everyone can read a book, listen to music, and watch movies without being offended. They should have their own section for that kind of material. Movies that are bad should be taken off the shelf and placed in a separate, locked section to prevent children from accessing them. This approach would ensure responsible access. Similarly, music deemed inappropriate should also be removed from general circulation and kept in a locked section, protecting younger audiences. Magazines considered unsuitable should follow the same protocol: removal from open shelves and storage in a locked area. Books that are bad should be taken off the shelf. They should have a section just for these books. These books should be locked up so children can't get them. I think that this would be fair for everyone. This is what I think should be done with this offensive material; by implementing these measures, everyone would have access to reading material, music, and movies suitable for their consumption.
191	3168	2	3	Picture this: you come home one day after work and before you even enter the house, you hear music blaring from your child's room. As you step closer, you begin to hear the lyrics that go with the banging bass and you realize that that isn't just any music, it's completely unedited, explicit versions of vulgar songs. Now, who would want their child listening to songs that make it seem like drinking, doing drugs, and other various risky activities are okay? I know I sure wouldn't. Music isn't the only source of offensive material in today's society. It can be found nearly anywhere. In books, magazines, TV shows, movies, on the internet, you name it. All of these are easily accessible by children of all ages. That is why there should be censorship of certain materials, to a certain degree. By this, I mean that if there is a dirty book in a public library, it should only be able to be rented by people who are of a certain age. Just because it's bad doesn't mean that it has to completely vanish from the face of the world. There should just be a limitation on who can view it. That applies to everything that could contain offensive material. Kids are kids. There are certain things that should be absolutely off limits to them--such as explicit movies, books, music, etc.--as they do not need to know about drugs, sex, or alcohol at such a young age. Censorship should definitely be in effect in places like public libraries where young children are bound to be. But, as mentioned earlier, censorship should only be to a certain degree, implemented thoughtfully so as to not impede the freedom of expression of adults. Keeping childrens' minds clean for as long as possible would be a very positive thing to do for both them and our society in general.
192	3169	2	3	'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Censorship is such a strong statement by Katherine Paterson in regards to censorship in libraries. So often today do we hear of books, magazines, and numerous other resources in libraries being banned because of unpopular views. A classic novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, has been removed from the shelves of many public and school libraries because of crude language such as the word 'nigger'. Libraries should not take resources off their shelves due to offensiveness because it goes against the library's purpose and because many people have different views. A library is a place with resources provided for information, interest, and enlightenment. When a book or magazine is taken away because of origin, background, or views that seem obscene or unpopular, then that library isn't serving its purpose. If I wanted to find a book on Islam but the library banned it because another religion found its teachings offensive, then why not ban the other religion's books as well? Censorship goes back to what was said by Katherine Paterson earlier. What might be offensive to one person could be a lifestyle or interest to another. Children, however, should be treated as a special case. No, a child should probably not, in my opinion, be reading about adult things such as sex. However, that child's parent or guardian is the only one who has the right to restrict resources they feel are inappropriate. In most public libraries, young children are not allowed to roam the library without an adult. Censorship is a very prominent rule because it sets boundaries for the adolescent so they are not to read about or listen to anything they shouldn't. Also, it is keen that libraries divide up the different resources into separate sections for children, young adults, and adults. Banning books and such from libraries takes away a part of history and leaves a gap for the future. To find that what our parents were once reading is restricted should not be an issue. Materials should not be censored in libraries because they are found offensive because censorship is censorship and it takes away our rights. Therefore, libraries must resist the urge to censor materials based on subjective offense to uphold intellectual freedom and the right to access diverse perspectives.
193	3170	2	3	I dont think we should not take books, Music, Movies, and Magazines off the shelf gets because we think they are offensive to us. If you think somthing is offensive dont get it I know I would not get somthing that I think is offensive to me. Their lot's of books in the world that i dont like. One of them is @CAPS1 Books, maybe those with overly complicated plots. I hate them with all of my heart. The next kind of books that I think is offensive is @CAPS2 Books because their are lots of story that are in their that we dont read. So I think that it is a wast of paper. The last kind of books I think is offensive is @CAPS3 Books because they are hard to read them in @CAPS3, especially when the print is too small. Their are lot's of music out there I dont like. One of them is @CAPS5. I dont know why I dislike @CAPS5 but I do. The next type @CAPS6- @CAPS7. The singer in todays @CAPS6- @CAPS7 I think are no good. The last type of music is some of todays rap. I think some of todays rap uses to much bad words. Their are lot's of movies out their I dont like. The first one is @CAPS10 @CAPS11. I did not get the hole plut of that movie. The next one @CAPS12 of the corn. Their was no way I could find out way the @CAPS12 was killing the people over @NUM1 in that town. The last movie that I did not like was ALL the @CAPS13 movies. I just did not like them ok? I think all of these things are offensive. But I still know that people like them so I would not take them away. There are thing people like but I dont like them. Their things that my friend like but I dont like. Their thing I like and they dont like. But I guess what I am trying to say is in life there are going to be things that you dont like, and removing them just because you don't personally enjoy them would be unfair to others.
194	3171	2	3	Our founding fathers created amendments for the people. One of the greatest is the freedom of speech. Censorship of offensive materials is unnecessary. Books, music, movies, and magazines often have bad messages or nudity, but that does not give anyone the right to get rid of them. Book burning happened because of the dislike of people's writing. People have the right to say how they feel by any medium. Censorship of anything makes a child more immature.  Book burning is a horrible action by any person. People used to burn them because of all the sex, drugs, and violence, but doing this destroys people's dreams, theories, and ideas. In the book *Fahrenheit 451*, firemen would burn any book seen within a home. Almost every single book in the world is not factual, unless it is nonfiction. The firemen in the novel destroyed any bits of type because it was false and went against the government. That basically means every kind of book out there. The causation of such a tragedy was that every citizen befriended their television or video games. Without books there would be no real sort of entertainment. Also, the things we read everyday are what make us who we are so there, in fact, should not be less books but more.  Libraries have no right to censor books. Freedom of speech has been around almost since the beginning of this nation. Why should it change now? Stopping obscene literature from being in the reach of the people is stopping writers from speaking out. They have already written their ideas, but if nobody reads their work then there is no way that they'll be heard. Libraries are not there to stop things from reaching little kids' ears but to provide any knowledge a man needs.  Parents have always stopped their precious babies from watching certain shows and movies. I once knew a woman who would never allow her son to watch the *Harry Potter* series because of the use of sorcery. She believed that he would try to learn witchcraft. I found that quite ridiculous when I heard about it. When a kid watches murder mysteries, fantasy shows, or dramas with bits of nudity, it is different to them and they are curious. After watching these kind of scenes, a parent needs to sit down with their child and talk about what they just saw. The child needs to know that killing is wrong and justice is good and magic and dragons don't exist. Nudity has always been considered a bad thing but penises and boobs are part of the human body. Kids will be more mature about it the more they see it, but that doesn't mean the child should watch porn.  Censorship has always been taken the wrong way. People believe if that the offensive material is shown then the watcher or reader will have bad thoughts about what they learned about. We should not get rid of the obscenity at all. We should have an understanding of the bad things in life. Burning books is a bad way to destroy the foundations of the human mind. Freedom of speech is a law and should be followed. Censorship is not always a good thing for children or anyone for that matter, so we must be vigilant in protecting this fundamental right.
195	3172	2	3	Should books, magazines, movies, and music be put in higher reaches of children, or should they be left in plain sight? Is it fair to not be capable to see a movie, magazine, or even read a book because others in the area believe it's offensive in their view? If an adult is reading a specific book or magazine and they feel it's only for their eyes to see it, then they should keep that item in a personal place that only he or she knows, not anyone else. Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. The reason for this is because it's not fair to others who haven't read them, and who would like to read them, but can't because they have been removed due to others opinions. If the books and magazines weren't appropriate for children then the companies wouldn't print them and release them to stands for them to be sold. If certain music also wasn't appropriate then music producers wouldn't let artists release that song out on a track.  There are many chances for school projects that may require getting information, but the student who is assigned to get it is not able to, due to the fact that adults think the website may be inappropriate. For example, in history class a student is assigned an assignment to get done over the weekend about topic X, topic Y, topic Z for a grade. Monday comes and he/she doesn't have it and gets a zero for the homework he/she was assigned. The student explains why he/she wasn't able to get any information. He/she starts explaining themself by saying 'the websites I went to were blocked. The books and magazines I tried checking out were either thrown out, or I wasn't able to check them out.' 'It's all because our neighbors who live in this neighborhood think the pictures and words are offensive, and since then the librarians stopped putting them out on shelves.'  The teacher then says, 'well then I will go and sign out a book for you and you can try and get as much information out as you can, how does that sound to you?' 'Good, at least it's better then getting a zero on the assignment,' said the student. Tuesday at 8:00 AM comes, and the student has as much information he/she was able to get out of the two books, and hands it to the teacher. At the end of class it gets graded and the grade on it turns out to be a C. Student is happy for picking up the grade but is still unhappy he/she wasn't able to get the items they needed from the start.  This is why movies, books, magazines, or even music should not be removed from shelves. Things like this will probably happen, and the kids will land up getting in trouble for not having the assignment turned in which is not even their fault. If only a few citizens have opinions about certain items and they feel that those items should be removed, then they should be from their sight, and they shouldn't bother thinking of them. Even if it's for safety of the children they may have in the house with them, then they shouldn't even have the books out of the little private personal spot where nobody knows of except for that one particular person, ensuring that access and availability are maintained for those who wish to engage with the material.
196	3173	2	3	Bad things in @CITY in @YEAR's Libraries are a great place to learn about many things, from earth's history to where will we be in the future. I think some things should not be on the shelves of a library because some books can be found very offensive to some people. Even movies and music can be offensive to some people. I think the music of @YEAR is a big problem because the lyrics can be very offensive. Movies are not a huge issue but they can be at times.  There are many reasons movies can be offensive. If they are offensive why put them in the libraries? Well the libraries just want to make money so they do not care about offensive products. For example a Vietnam War movie that is inaccurate and poorly made might be offensive to real life Vietnam War veterans. The veterans then might want the movie taken off the shelves. I have seen some great Vietnam War movies but I have also seen some bad ones too. My grandpa was a veteran and he saw a bad Vietnam War and got so upset he cursed at the television and almost threw the remote at it.  Then there is the problem with the music of @YEAR. I do not think stores including libraries should sell albums of @YEAR's rap artists because all they talk about is drugs, sex, and girls. If you ask me it's stupid. But when you start selling them in a library there is something wrong with that library. Some country singers can be like that too because all they sing about is getting drunk then having sex. I just think the most of the music of @YEAR is really pointless and a waste of time because when I listen to it I think this is stupid and makes no sense.  Books can be offensive sometimes it just depends on the writer. Books with a lot of cursing can be offensive to religions groups who are forbidden to curse or read curse words. Why put it on the shelves of libraries then? Well it all leads back to money. If people buy the books that mean the libraries get money and the more books people buy the richer the libraries becomes. I read a book that was about someone killing cats and I found that offensive because I love cats I would never hurt them. I got really mad when I read it so I threw it down and took it to the library and complained to them.  So overall the libraries should be more careful on what they put on the shelves for people to buy. If the libraries put the wrong things on the shelves they might end up in a law suit, but if they do not put offensive things on the shelves they will not end up being in a law suit. Therefore, careful consideration is needed to balance free access to information with the need to avoid causing offense.
197	3174	2	3	I do believe that some places have magazines, books, movies, and music that need to be removed from all shelves. Just think, if you had children would you want them getting ahold of a magazine with nude men or women in it? Yes people tell you they have control of their kids in stores, but I know you see kids all the time walking away or roaming off to try to do what they want, and go to places they shouldn't be like magazines for instance. Would you want to find your little one looking at a magazine with nude women in it? That's not the things kids should be finding in stores, it's not necessary.  Same deal goes with movies, say you rent a movie from one of your many movie places and it has nudity or cursing in it, do you want that around your kids? I know I wouldn't, cause kids are like monkeys, monkey see monkey do, and you don't want your little one walking around cussing at you. I have little cousins and I've seen it happen many times where they cuss back at their parents, and when the parents ask them where they heard that it's usually the same answer, tv or movies. Exposure to such content can desensitize children.  So do you really think it's necessary to have all that bad stuff around for anyone, of many ages to see? It's not. Everything like that just needs to be taken off all shelves and destroyed, cause I shouldn't have to see it and neither should anyone else, it's gross, nasty, and inappropriate to children. I say get rid of it all and do everyone a favor, thereby creating a more wholesome environment for all.
198	3175	2	3	Libraries contain many different selections of books, music, and magazines. However, are all of these materials appropriate for all library visitors? In this essay I will explain to you why I think offensive, distracting and inappropriate material should be removed off of the shelves, and put into their own section of public places. If a small child were to walk into a public library and pick up a book about abortions, they would not know what the book is talking about, because most small children cannot read. What if a fifth grader was to pick that same book up? They would be able to read the whole thing with no problems. However, should a fifth grader be allowed to pick up a book about abortions at such a young age? I dont think so, fifth graders should be reading age appropriate books. This is just one reason why I think offensive, distracting and inappropriate material should be moved to its own section of the library. When I think of a library I think of a quiet place that I can go to and read, or study. Although, some Libraries allow their visitors to listen to music. Rather it be on a computer, on an ipod, or even on a cell phone, there should be a sound limit right? Most people would think that Libraries set sound limits, and they probably do, but people do not follow directions and they are not attentive to what other people are doing. It is very distracting to go into a library, to study, and the person next to you has their ipod blasted to a heavy metal rock song. Once again, this is another reason I think offensive, distracting, and inappropriate material should be moved to its own area of the library. I also think that a library is a community place, that you can go to and be safe, and your parents would not have to go with you because they think that it is safe and appropriate too. Most Libraries have magazines, because its for your entertainment, and they want to keep you happy so you will keep coming back. Well not all magazines are rated PG, some have very inappropriate material in them. A child should be looking at magazines that are appropriate for children, a teenager should be looking at magazines that are for teenagers, and an adult should be looking at magazines for adults. However the adult magazines should not be showing people with barely any clothes on, or any sexual scenes, and neither should teenage magazines. With innapropriate magazines, I do not think they should have their own section of the library, I think they should be removed all together. They have pictures in them and anyone can look at a picture. To further ensure a safe and conducive environment, librarians could also provide guidance and recommendations to patrons, helping them select materials that align with their age and interests. I really hope you can understand my point of view. It is nothing against public Libraries, it is just the material inside of them. If I owned a public library, I would have rooms devoted to books that are for different age groups. For example, I would have a room for 12+, and a room for 18+. Those rooms would be for the books that are easily questionable for younger children. I would also have my own room devoted for music only. That way anyone could go in the room and listen to whatever kind of music they want, no questions asked. The rest of the library would be for people to study, and read. I think every library should be like this, it would help make the world a better place. By implementing these changes, libraries can continue to serve as valuable resources for the community while also ensuring a safe and respectful environment for all visitors.
199	3176	2	3	Hello, my name is @CAPS1 and I think that books, newspapers, and magazines being censored should be done but shouldn't. When I say that I mean that some books dealing with adventure or romance might have parts that need to be censored, but thats how the author made the book. It was meant to catch your attention right off the first sentence of the story. I believe that sometimes magazines need to be censored because they are promoting bad habits for people all across the @LOCATION1 and other people around the world. Magazines in my opinion should be censored. Now some make it to where there less inaproperate which is somewhat a good thing, but others pretty much just let it slide and figure it will raise the sales by how ever much percent they want it to be considering what they put in the magazine. I feel that books should stay on the shelf however. Some people feel that the 'censored' parts of the story are really what catches there attention. I myself have never had an expirence in this field because im not one to be a strong reader, but knowing how other people are, I would suggest that we censor some things, but not all. People write books all the time dealing with something that has happened in their lifetime or something from their imagination. So we can't really help what people think about and what some people write down to be published in a book. For some readers, it is a very interesting story or passage being read from the back cover of the book, while others just want the book gone from there neighborhood library or out of their house. It all really depends on the reader. If I could, there would be things I would censor, but not in books. It was their idea to put it in the story but some things need to be left unsaid. Some readers appriciate it, while others do not. It is really their choice to read the book and if its not appealing to them they can simply put it back on the shelf and find another close to it. I just feel that some magazines should be censored. Constantly, you see swimsuit models and 'sexual appeal' in magazines everyday when you enter the grocery store or library. I just do not think it is right for little kids to see that when there looking for a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 book or a book about their favorite animal. Another reason to censor magazines would be because of some religious views on what people see when they look at the magazine. People everyday become @CAPS4 and being right with @CAPS5, so people will take offense to some of the disturbing images in magazines. I myself as a @CAPS6 take offense to some of these magazines, promoting being perfect and having the life sucked out of you as you read each passage. As I have said, I am to the understanding of the books having what they have in them, because of the authors imagination, but some magazines just need to be thrown off the shelf because they are sometimes harmful.
200	3177	2	3	"I believe movies and books shouldn't be removed from availability. Individuals should have the freedom to choose what they consume. Music, like country or sad songs, is different; unlike movies or books, you can't simply remove it from the radio. You can turn it off, lower the volume, or change the station, but in today's world, there will always be content you dislike alongside content you enjoy.  Regarding movies, I would likely choose to keep certain ones away if I had the power. While there are good and bad movies, some are offensive, like ""Shiloh,"" which depicts an old man hitting a dog. This is deeply offensive, especially to someone raised around beatings. Ultimately, the decision of what to watch or listen to should rest with the individual, even if some content is disagreeable."
201	3178	2	3	We all enjoy having the freedom to read, listen, and watch what we like. How would you feel if that freedom was taken away from you? Some people believe that censored books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries. I believe you should have the right to read, listen, and watch whatever you choose, but children should talk to their parents about it first if it is a censored material. We all know that not everything is okay for certain age groups to read, see, or listen to. That does not mean that the item should be removed completely though. Instead, the child should talk to a parent about the censored item. The parent can decide if the child is mature enough for the item. Also, if those materials are removed from libraries completely, someone that is mature enough to be reading, listening, or seeing it will not have a chance to. I remember when I was in middle school, I really wanted to read @PERSON1 Judy Blume novels that I saw at the library. My mother believed that I should not read those novels at that age. My mother and I worked out a compromise that I could read Judy Blume novels that she approved of. She said when I was older, I could read any of Judy Blume's novels that I wanted. I found this compromise to be very fair. I knew that when I was old enough to read those novels, they would still be there on the shelf waiting for me. We should have the right to read, listen, and watch what we enjoy, but younger children or other age groups should be monitored. That does not mean we need to completely remove those materials from libraries though. When those children are old enough to read, watch, or listen to those materials, they should be able to go to the library, knowing it will be there on the shelf waiting for them, allowing them to exercise their freedom of choice when the time is right.
202	3179	2	3	No, no I do not. It is one thing to censor a book or movie, but to completely remove it is another. I feel like authors, artists, musicians, and writers should have the freedom to write and say what they want, regardless of who is reading it. I feel like censorship is wrong. Authors should be able to feel free to express their thoughts and feelings about a subject or topic in any way they like. Sometimes stories cannot be explained or told the way it needs to be without certain words. Whether those words be good or bad, I feel like without them, the book that is being read is not all of what it could have been. In my opinion, censorship takes away from certain values or qualities the book could have had with the original context still in it, and to me that is not fair. It's not fair to the author, and is most certainly not fair to the reader who is reading the book. I know from my personal experiences with reading books that 'yes' I have read books that have had bad language in them, but just because a book has one or two bad words in it does not mean that it should be completely taken off the shelf. For example the book '@CAPS1' @CAPS2: @PERSON1 was an amazing book. I probably enjoyed that book more than I have any other book that I have ever read in my entire life, but that book would not be nearly as good as it was with it being censored or taken off the shelf for that matter. All I am trying to get at is that good books with bad language should not be censored just because of some of the words it has in it, because that is getting away from what the overall message is about. You're almost taking the words out of context when you do this. Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? No, I do not. Neither should you, as that removes the art and message the author was trying to convey.
203	3180	2	3	Sexual conduct, language, and criminal behavior are three big things in my school, and community. Certain books, movies, music, and magazines are all about those three things. If they are in our libraries, how can teachers and administration keep us from it during school? I think the censorship of some movies, magazines, and especially music should be highly discussed, and more strict. We do not really have a lot of movies in our school library, but I do know that there are some in the town library. Parents and adults do not want us growing up so fast, and yet they allow sexual, crude language movies to be on the shelves of libraries. If it is such a big deal, I think they need to be removed. I'm a big believer on the fact that if it happens, it is going to happen no matter WHAT precautions are taken. But with that said, we can still take the needed precautions to keep it from kids that are too young to see them, like under the age of 13. It is not just movies that we have to worry about though. COSMOPOLITAN is a magazine that is devoted to giving their readers tips on sex, problems with their sex lives, and the occasional 'WHAT to wear this SEASON!' articles. I will say that I have read this magazine, but it doesn't appeal to my interests. Some kids today though, are very attentive to those subjects. Again, that goes back to the problem of kids growing up too fast. I have noticed in my school alone, that it is a rapidly growing problem. If magazines like this weren't on the shelves for us to see whenever we enter a library, maybe we would not be as keen to the idea. If we were not introduced to it so early, we would not be going behind our parents' backs trying to do it. COSMOPOLITAN, and other magazines like it, needs to be taken off the shelves as soon as possible. Music is a world-wide phenomenon. Say a child around the age of 10 is listening to the new RAPPER'S Drake song. He is being introduced to crude language, sexual behavior, and criminal acts in the 3 minute time period it takes to listen to the full song. Seriously, it only takes that long for a child to be introduced, and it is only one song out of the thousands that are out there. This music is able to be accessed on many computers, especially in public, town libraries. We are not allowed to act like that in school, and if we are going to be spending 7 of our childhood/teenage years here, why let us listen to it? If you walk into a library, all you have to do is sign your name, the date, and the time you got there to access a computer. After that, they can not tell you to get off of it, unless you are violating the law or looking up something not age appropriate. Music does not fall into that category. It, too needs to be taken away if the language, sexual conduct, and criminal behavior messages are adult rated. I, personally, love magazines, movies, and music. They are my three m's and I live by them. But not the ones that are going to get me in trouble, put wrong messages in my head, or cause me (subconsciously) do participate in a criminal act. I always allow my mother or father to read books, listen to music, and watch movies with me. If they are not pleased with WHAT it is, I will not do it behind their back. The censorship in libraries needs to be more strict. If it were more strict, it would keep our younger children from growing up to fast and keep teens from participating in criminal acts. The censorship in libraries is an ongoing problem and it needs to be fixed to ensure a more appropriate and safer environment for younger individuals.
204	3181	2	3	The diversity of the world makes it rather difficult to please every person all of the time. What I find appropriate, another may find obscene and vulgar. What I enjoy to read, or listen to, or watch, or any other manner of media consumption I indulge in, may insult or bother someone else; as a matter of fact it probably does. That still does not make it right to remove what I, or others like because it offends another person. A child walks through a grocery store, doesn't get what they want and proceeds to drop the f-bomb. More than half the time, they heard that language from their parents. If not their parents, then the media right? Maybe so, but that media shouldn't be hidden for the 'just-in-case' a child hears it. If a parent or guardian does not want their child to hear such things, they shouldn't allow them to listen to it. They control what does and does not enter their house. To remove such things from the library, would be like trying to keep a child from ever seeing a naked body, or hearing a curse word. Every time they bathe they'd need blinders from themselves and they'd never be able to leave their house, because people do not always watch what they say in public. No, I do not feel like every type of movie, or book, etc., belongs in the library. There is a cut-off as to how inappropriate or vulgar something should be and still be allowed in a public library. Novels that are so descriptive that the reader can almost see every aspect of the procreation taking place between the pages, should have its own place, separate from the public library, right along with the movies that really do show every aspect. Although I like the thought, to actually remove said books would be unfair. To deny access to those who find those books fine for themselves would be wrong. A wise author, Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' The truth of this statement would not be hard to prove. A religious family that believes Harry Potter, a book I find to be innocent fantasy, is a book series promoting witchcraft and satanism, so they remove them from the library. I remove the previously stated graphic romance novels. A mother whom wants her child to be sheltered from what she considers the filth of the planet, removes books of drug addicts, and abuse, and books of war because they're full of death. And as this continues, finally, we are left with the empty shelves of a forgotten building that no longer has a purpose. The graphic novels I find inappropriate could be placed in an adult section, or higher up than most children can reach. The protective parents can deny their own children the media they deem inappropriate, instead of the world. Although not everything is appropriate for everyone, it isn't right to censor something from the world, because while you may not approve of certain material, others may find value in it. There are ways to censor things to parts and not others, offering a compromise between unrestricted access and outright removal. Nothing should be removed from the library because of its content; at most it should be placed in a less accessible manner, allowing individuals to make their own choices about what they consume.
205	3182	2	3	There are many different people in this world, who have many different opinions about books, music, movies, magazines, etc. BECAUSE one person does not particularly like horror movies, that does not mean that movie stores should remove horror films from their shelves. As creepy as it MAY sound, there are many people in the world who are slasher film freaks. They live and breathe scary movies. I myself like ANYTHING about everything out there. I will read any book or listen to any type of music; it actually widens my taste in certain materials. I feel like everyone should try new things. Say growing up your favorite books were CALLED The LION The WITCH and The WARDROBE. and you would like to share your childhood stories with your children. BUT IMAGINE, bookstores took CALLED The LION The WITCH and The WARDROBE off of their shelves because a tiger and a pig could never be friends. This is nonsense. Many people like many different things; there is no reason to only sell what you like, otherwise your business will fail, because variety is key in catering to a diverse customer base and ensuring long-term success.
206	3183	2	3	What is considered offensive? If we took books, music, movies and magazines that people found offensive off shelves, there would be nothing left. Everyone is different, which means they all get offended in different ways. By taking all this off shelves, we would be providing a smaller education for students around the world. Things we learn about in school, slavery, wars, and some politics, now all these things could offend many people, but if we were to take them off the shelves at school and libraries, children will have no idea about history or what is going on in the current world. What about drugs and alcohol, many parents do not talk to their children about the uses of controlled substances, so without these sources, they would never know the harm that they can do to someone's body. Everyone takes something offensive, but not everyone takes the same thing offensive. So, who is to say what offends people and what does not? If that's the case, shouldn't we take all books, movies, music, and magazines away from children's schools and libraries? Adults get offended too, so would we take all of their resources away, also including the newspaper? By taking away what one might call offensive, it would land us in the dark ages with no books, no local news, no movies, no nothing because not one person can say what the whole world considers offensive. Everyone has the right to read and write what they want, and no one can say what offends everyone. Someone might get offended by talking about one's race, another might get offended by talking about LGBTQ+ issues, and someone might even get offended if you talk about their cute little kitty cat. Everyone looks at everything differently, so why try and control us all as one? All people think differently, and they know what they want to read, hear, and watch all by themselves; they don't need someone to tell them, making the idea of a universal standard of offensiveness not only impossible but also a threat to individual autonomy and intellectual growth.
207	3184	2	3	Censorship should only be used for areas in which young children are exposed to, such as schools and tv shows intended for young children. Things that aren't intended for young children should not be censored. If you were to censor everything because some people find it offensive then we would never be able to find new ideas to improve our community. Censoring books, movies, magazines, and music that aren't intended for young people is a waste of time. If you were to take a book off a shelf that explained the *principles* of *aerodynamics* because a person found it offensive then we would never make advances in technology. Censoring items like books is just plain idiotic and ignorant. Studying material is our only way to advance in science, and if we can't get the right books to study because they were taken off the shelf due to it being offensive then we will never make breakthroughs in technology.  Parents that feel that books, movies, and magazines should be censored really aren't good parents. If they really were concerned with those topics then they shouldn't buy them the movies or the books that they find offensive. It seems that parents want to proclaim they want to censor those items because they find it offensive. But not all parents feel the same way, some parents are open with their children about these topics and feel that their children are mature enough to handle things like these.  As a child I wasn't shielded from these kinds of situations. I grew up without censorship. I watched movies and read books that were never censored, and I was mature enough to know what it all meant. I see why parents want to censor their kids from topics like those, but they never take the time to talk to their children about these topics and see if they are mature enough to handle it.  Censorship is great for children's tv shows. But when you start to censor someone's ideas because you find them offensive and wrong then you are being ignorant. People here have freedom of speech and deserve the right to not have their work censored because a small group finds it offensive. Censorship is a great tool, if used right; however, overusing it will only hinder the growth of society and limit the free exchange of ideas that are vital for progress.
208	3185	2	3	"Book Censorship? Should books be censored? This is a national problem about the contents of books. It is a big deal. What one parent feels is very offensive another may feel it has a necessary life lesson that their children need to learn. If you ask me that question I would say, ""Yes, I believe the books should, but to a national scale and not a community one."" By this I mean a book with things like references to nudity or other things of vulgar nature, not just because it has a bad word in it that a parent feels to be inappropriate for their child. I believe there should be a national rating system for books like there is in the movie industry. Also, I believe that it is the parents' job to regulate what their children read. If they believe the book is vulgar or inappropriate, but the system doesn't, then you need to prevent their children from reading it without taking it off the shelf. It is the parents' job to regulate the reading of their children not the contents of the bookshelf. Like in Katherine Paterson's article, ""All of us can think of a book we hope none of our children or any children have taken off the shelf. But if I had the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" By this I believe she means that if we all took a book off the shelves for our children there would be no books because what is not offensive to you may be very offensive to another parent. So the parents should leave it on the shelf and prevent their own kids from reading it and let the other parents worry about their own kids. Yes, I believe in a government censorship program but to an extent, focusing on truly vulgar content and not just differing opinions. It is the parents' job to regulate the readings of their children, but they do not need to regulate the contents of the bookshelf, allowing for diverse perspectives while still protecting children under their care."
209	3186	2	3	No, I would not think it would be the right thing to do. To just take a book off the shelf just because one person or a small amount of people think that one book is offensive to them. It's not only one person to decide that. People or some people would like to vote or have a meeting about taking a book or books off the shelf cause it's offensive to them. Just because one person finds that book or books offensive doesn't mean that they should have the right to just throw the book away. There could be many people out there that really like that book or those books, and they wouldn't be able to enjoy them anymore. All because one person or a few other people don't like the book. Yes, there are books out there that a lot of people don't like, but that still doesn't give one person the right to throw the book out, all because they don't like that book or that series of a book. No one should have the right to just take a book that they don't like out of a library and throw it out because they don't like it. There could be a smart little boy or girl that likes that book, and because that one person threw it away because they don't like it, now that little boy or girl won't get to read their favorite book. That's why I don't think books that someone thinks is offensive should be taken out of a library, because there's always someone out there that likes that one book that you might want to throw away. If you think the book is that offensive to you, just stay away from that area of the library and don't think about that book. It is important to respect the diverse reading preferences of others and allow access to a wide range of materials, even if some find certain books disagreeable.
210	3187	2	3	The media is a way for some people to get out and reach others. Whether it is a magazine, movie etc everyone in the world is going to see it some way or another. If that piece of work isn't seen as acceptable from many peoples point of views it shouldn't be available to the public. I personally beleive that if something is seen as volgure and offence it shouldnt be displayed. Millions of people will be viewing this and I wouldn't want my kid looking at it. Why would anyone else want the opposite? Kids pay attention to detail really well and something so negative could change the mindset of the child, influencing their behavior and values. We all want to bring our kids up right and letting them have availabilty to negative material is uncalled for. Its not only kids either that are affected, adults also are affected by the media; their perceptions and beliefs can be swayed. Adults can get fooled too, beleive me. I remember one time that there were books and magazines at my school that were being taken off shelves for this exact same reason. I beleive that what the librarians did was right. Some kids in the school shouldn't be viewing or reading about unacceptable things, as they may lack the critical thinking skills to properly process it. Some students @MONTH1 not have matured enough and can take something in a different view than another student. I beleive that if something is taken off a shelf because it doesn't seem appropriate enough I stand for whoever it is that did it. Nothing with a negative affect on a person should be viewed by an innocent child. There should be a positive affect on the child at all times so he or she is brought up to the best of its abilities, and shielding them from harmful content is a crucial part of that process.
211	3188	2	3	I think that they should remove books, and take away more stuff from the kids now a days, because they are getting worse in worse like everyday, i think they should move the 6th grade to 8th grade, so atleast they are old enough to read, hear, or watch whatever they want, but they should go through and do a self-check on everything that they put out in the stores.They should also have different parts in a library so that the little ones dont get to the adult section, such as adult books, that have stuff in them about sex, drugs, or anything else that falls under that catagory. I have 3 little brothers, and they are 6, 7, 8. They know more stuff then my parents, and its because now a days kids pick up on stuff a lot more easier. So i say we as in the United States citizens need to watch out on how we put stuff out there that the kids can get a hold of. When i was growing-up i didnt know as much as my little brothers do today, and that is because everyday they are coming out with something else everyday that can effect our kids, brothers, or whoever. I also do think the schools should have a class about the stuff that kids are experiencing in todays life, in like elementary school, so that when they get older they will already know about the drugs, or the sex life. Kids also remember stuff a lot more when they are growing up, so if we put it in there heads at a really really young age, they will remember it. Im not saying that kids will stop doing what they are doing, but atleast the percent population will go down, and parents will be a lot more happier. I also think that parents should stop lying to there kids about sex, making up stories so that there kid wont know, they need to stop doing that because they are going to find out about it sooner or later, so why not now? they whould be more aware of the real life in how it is out there, so all the parents out there should not lie to there kids about the sex life. So thats what my person input is on the situation. I wish this would change sooner or later before the world becomes a big mess, and hopefully we can create a better environment for our children.
212	3189	2	3	Books have been a part of every single person's life as soon as they learn to read. First, our parents read us books to get us to go to sleep. Then, our teachers read us books to teach us things or to keep us preoccupied. Then, when we get a little older, we are assigned to read books for classes. There is even reading in the workplace, whether it be receipts or orders or recipes. Reading is something that we cannot get away from. This leads me to say that authors write books for an audience and write the book as best they can to attract the attention of the audience. I do not believe that books, regardless if one person deems them offensive, should be removed from the shelf that they have been placed on. I think that there are things we can do if we do not want to read that particular book. There are also things parents can do to ensure that the books their children are reading are appropriate and not offensive. Also there are advantages to reading books that show something different that that person has experienced before.  First, I feel that books should not be removed from libraries because some people think that they are offensive. Everyone has an opinion and just because one person does not like the book, should not mean that the experience of reading that book should be taken away from someone else. If you find a book to be offensive, you can simply stop reading the book. Just because you do not enjoy it does not mean someone else will not also. That is just apart of humans having their own opinions.  On a different note, I think that children's books are a little bit different. Parents have the right and responsibility to protect their children. I believe that parents should take a proactive role in monitoring their children. For young children, I think that parents should just read the book first and judge whether or not they think their child should read it. Then for young adults, I think that parents could try to look up some things about the book. The internet is a great source for reviews and ratings of books. Therefore, I believe that censorship for children's books is a responsibility of the parent.  Lastly, I think books are different to everyone and can be interpreted differently. When I read a book, think about the scheme, imagine the characters, and react to the events, I come up with my own opinion of the book. My friend, who is also reading the same book, could form a completely different opinion of the book. But we both gained something by reading the book, and that is the most important part.  In conclusion, I think that books should be censored by parents and that is it. I think that reading books is a very positive thing. So no one should have the right to tell people what they should and should not read. Also, books are things that can be discussed and everyone can make their own opinions about. It is my opinion that every book should have its own place on a shelf, allowing readers to explore diverse perspectives and form their own conclusions.
213	3190	2	3	I believe that they should not be pulled off of the shelf if they are found to be offensive. Many people have their own taste in what they like to read, write and do. Therefore, there should be a wide variety of these things on the shelves so people can do what they enjoy best. Books and magazines may be offensive, but they may also entice the reader. I personally love books about drugs, sex, and many other inappropriate things. In fact my favorite book is banned from my school library. If they took all inappropriate books out of the library, what would I read? Not everything can be just peachy keen all the time. It's not in real life, so why should we have to read a little fantasy world that we know isn't true? I know I wouldn't want to read that. Just like books and magazines, everyone has their own taste in music. Some like country, classical, metal, and maybe even rock. If you took the songs that were offensive off the shelf that would make people angry. That's like not playing a song on the radio that's offensive, and many songs played on the radio are degrading to women. If it can be played on the radio, why can't it be in a library? They're going to be able to listen to that song on the radio anyway. Most movies these days are very gory or offensive in many aspects. Many people are interested in these movies. If you can watch that movie in a movie theatre, why can't you check it out of a library? Some people go to check out movies that are shown in school so they can watch it if they were absent. What would they do if that movie got taken off the shelf? Fail? I know I would become angry if that would happen to me. Keep offensive books, music, movies, and magazines on the library shelves. People will eventually see them, hear them, and watch them even if it's not in the library. Even if you take out offensive materials they're still going to get them sooner or later no matter what you do, so censorship is not the answer.
214	3191	2	3	I have never been in a library and found a book so offensive that I complained or tried to get it removed. I've also never read a book halfway through and questioned why I was reading it. I wouldn't read a book I know I won't like. If someone has the right to take books off the shelf that bothers them, then I have the same right. I thought everyone was treated equally. When I read, I always read the back or summary to see if I'll like it. If I know a book, magazine, or movie will offend me, I won't bother with it. The author likely dislikes censorship, which is why she's arguing about it. Everyone is entitled to their beliefs. I respect people who stand up for themselves. I don't frequent libraries but if I found an offensive book, it would probably offend someone else. Why be offensive? Everyone has a right to their opinion, and if something offends one person, it might bother others. People share agreements and disagreements.  I agree with @PERSON1 because she's right; people can be offended by many things. I've been offended by movies, books, music, and magazines, but I didn't let it consume me. I stopped watching or reading what bothered me. Stand up for your rights and beliefs, but don't let things bother you; move on. @CAPS1't ever tell anyone that you can't believe in your opinions.  I've had many experiences with offensive content. Once, I watched a movie where a black man was wrongly accused and killed in prison because of his race and the time period. That upsets me because we are all the same. We @MONTH1 look and see things differently, but our bodies function the same, and we breathe the same air. I've always believed, '@CAPS1't ever judge a book by it's cover until you read it.'  So, whatever people @MONTH1 think, I believe in letting people believe what they want. @CAPS1't ever tell someone how to think, act, or feel. I agree with Katherine Paterson, as everyone is entitled to their own viewpoint and should be allowed to hold those beliefs without being censored.
215	3192	2	3	"When I go to a library I often find some stuff that is offensive to me. But if something is offensive to me, the person beside me might not think the same thing is offensive to him or her. When people try to put boundaries on what is offensive and what is not, they cannot, because there is a wide variety of people that all have different opinions based on their history. What I think is offensive might be seen as the best thing that has ever been printed, published, or recorded in other people's eyes. The major problem is that ""offensive"" doesn't have a set definition, and I don't think that you will ever find a definition that everyone can agree on. There needs to be limitations to keep certain things away from certain age groups; for example, you would not want a kindergartener to be able to check out a RATED R movie. Some censoring has to be done to protect people, but it all comes down to common sense. We won't ever all agree on what is offensive, but if we use our common sense, the problem can be solved. Ultimately, while complete agreement on what constitutes offensive material is unlikely, employing common sense in curating and accessing information is crucial for navigating diverse perspectives and protecting vulnerable groups."
216	3193	2	3	Certain people believe that offensive books, magazines, or music should be taken off of the shelves of libraries. I think that offensive books and music and media should not be taken off of the shelves. It is a person's own right to see certain things that are offensive if they choose to do so. It is also not another person's right to decide what other people can and cannot observe. If certain offensive things were taken off of the shelves of libraries such as music, books etc., the knowledge of people would be limited to only what the library or the government would want them to know, and that is not right. It is someone's personal decision whether or not they look at, listen to, or read offensive things. People shouldn't be sheltered by society and only know what is wanted for them to know. If libraries eliminated offensive media then people would be unable to form their own opinions and ideas. In some cases, reading and knowing certain things that are offensive to some people should be known to the world. One case is how people should know about the Holocaust in the 1940s. I'm sure reading about the Holocaust is very offensive to copious amounts of people, but even though this history is disturbing and offensive, people should know about it so that history does not repeat itself. The government and society do not have the right to decide what people take in. For example, what if all of a certain type of music was eliminated from libraries, the internet, and TV; it would slowly dissolve out of existence. Certain things like reading about the times before racial equality, and such things as slavery are very offensive for people to read about. But these things must be read and heard and passed down through history so it isn't forgotten. The knowledge of offensive things should not be taken away from people by the libraries. Yes, offensive things shouldn't be celebrated or looked upon as good, but people should know. People in the world can't just know the good things or only what their society wants them to know, they also have to know about the bad things and offensive things that happen and have happened as well, so they can learn from them and strive for a better future.
217	3194	2	3	Katherine Paterson said ' If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. ' In this quote I think she was trying to get across that if someone picks up a book or a magazine and reads it and then puts it back and maybe its not the best book ever to them and they might find it offensive, but someone else comes along and wants to read it and they might not find it offensive, then you have two different view points on a book that might be offensive to one person, but to another it might not be. Different view points really effect how to censor books, because of how people are so different, there difference on how they feel about a book could effect what should happen to that book. I dont believe that books, movies, music, magazines, and other materials such as those should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive to someone. If they are found offensive to a bunch of different people then yes they should be removed, but if its only bothering one or two people but there are other people that agree that its not offensive, then dont get rid of it just because of a couple people. Take a vote maybe to see how many people agree and dissagree on keeping or getting rid of it then decide whether or not you should keep or get rid of it off of that vote. I think it would be more fair and satisfactory to take a vote on whether or not it is fair to keep or remove it. If someone has a memory about something they read or remember an experience from it and then someone else reads it and feels offened by something its not fair to the other person to get rid of it. Its especially not fair to the person with the memories and experiences. So dont remove books just because a couple people might find it offensive, take a vote to decide. Let more than just a few people deciede on behalf of the book. More than just a few people can make an impact on just one book, and you never know what differnt views you might find from different people on just one book. People need to be able to discuss their veiws on the book and then debate on whether or not to keep it, so dont choose to get rid of them without several view points on the book. Therefore, ensuring diverse perspectives are considered is crucial before any decision about removal is made, providing a more balanced and representative outcome.
218	3195	2	3	Library Censorship Everyone has their favorite book. But if it offended someone, should he be allowed to remove it? Offensive materials should not be removed from shelves. If we removed books that offended even one person, then no books would remain available for others. As americans, we have the right to freedom of speech. Authors use their freedom in their writing, just like musicians use their freedom to make music. But if we denied them their right to put out their creations, we would be denying them their basic rights as an american citizen. Personally, I hate rap music. I don't even consider it to be music, due to the fact that no one actually sings. But I do understand that a large percent of our population does enjoy listening to it. Should I be allowed to remove it from shelves, leaving teenagers without their music, denying artists' freedom of speech, and ultimately, leaving them unemployed? One of my favorite series is the @PERSON2 series, by @PERSON1. It is about a young teenager who learns to deal with all the struggles of growing up by depending on @CAPS1, and it helped me do the same. But because it is a @CAPS2 series, should it be removed from shelves? Should other young girls be denied the chance to read this life-changing series, simply because someone might find it offensive to their beliefs? Although some wish they could eliminate certain materials that they find offensive, it isn't fair to the authors, musicians, or fans of those pieces of work. However, those who find it offensive should be allowed to avoid it. Libraries need to make sure they separate each topic distinctly, so people can easily tell where they should or shouldn't avoid. Libraries are supposed to be a resource for everyone, which means they need to have materials for everyone, even though they might seem offensive to some individuals.
219	3196	2	3	Censorship in books is one of the main concerns in America. If it was up to me to remove a book from a shelf, I would not do it. To my personal opinion, I think that we as Americans should just read over the problems and quit complaining about it. Yes, we do have some books that people seem to not like, such as 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn', but the only reason that it has been pulled off the shelves of libraries and schools is because it uses the word 'nigger', and I find it to be kind of idiotic, that people would overreact to that word when themselves were not even around to know the real meaning of.  Censorship in music is another big concern for people in America. The lyrics used in most songs I find to be 'disturbing' or are trying to get people and young kids to commit acts of crime and other illegal acts. Music such as rap and the lyrics used in rap are what's making kids do stupid stuff; the music talks about sex, drug usage, and murder. I don't think that I would go as far as to pull it off the shelf, but I would make the sellers put them in a 'can only purchase if 18' section. Most of the crime we have today people blame on music.  To my observation about these subjects is that I have seen people read a book that uses profound language in it and be okay with it; they don't overreact to it, so therefore it shouldn't be removed from shelves. To my observation about the rap music, sure, in a way it should be pulled off the shelves and never be sold again, but, I have seen people who listen to it and never smoke, never kill, and never harm another person. To my own experience I listen to some of these gore-obsessed bands and read profound-language books and got over it; these things should be overlooked and forgotten.  This is just a common sense thing but, there are a lot of things that should be pulled off shelves, I would, and it has to do with movies and magazines. Some movies have always been a problem to society. I have witnessed that some movies show just a little bit too much nudity in it, which I seem to think is not a good thing that our younger children should see, whether it's at the theater or on t.v. these things should be pulled.  My observation about magazines is that I have personally heard one of my best friends say that 'I want to look as skinny and this girl does on this magazine because I'm too fat'. There are a lot of magazines that should not be showed or read because it does say that skinny is better and so many girls and women are starving themselves to look like the person on the cover of a magazine, and it's ridiculous to see that happen. If it was my choice, I would ban these materials from usage or sight, mainly because this is all just one big peer pressure conspiracy. I would not ban all of the things that I have put in this paper, just the things that I personally find disturbing or not fit for the public's eyes; therefore, censorship should be applied selectively based on potential harm and societal impact, rather than outright banning.
220	3197	2	3	I don't think censorship is right for our public libraries. In my opinion, it depends on the content itself, whether it's written or visual. Also, it depends on the age of the audience, whether they are children or adults, as people have different levels of understanding and maturity. Their individual interpretation, or the way they take it in their significations, is also important. If books, music, movies, and magazines are removed from the shelves simply because they are deemed offensive, that wouldn't be a very good idea because how would other people access that material and decide for themselves if they want to engage with it? Some people enjoy reading that kind of content and nothing else. I just don't think that people would be too happy. Also, there are different cultures in these countries, and people may want to read materials that reflect their heritage or explore different perspectives. People would like to learn about different things. If books and other materials were taken off the shelves, there would be hardly anything to read. Children's and adult books cover all different kinds of things. The books you can read can contain more than just offensive content; sometimes, they can offer valuable information or insights. In conclusion, censorship is not good in our public libraries because it removes basic resources and limits people's access to a wide range of reading materials, thereby reducing the opportunity for learning and exploration.
221	3198	2	3	If the library is in a highschool then we are all old enough that we have already seen or heard anything and everything offensive. In case we haven't though you can't shield your kids from offensive material. This @CAPS1 censorship hurts them in the long run. Such as when your boss gets to work and you or someone around you mess up a important assignment or task he @MONTH1 might use terms such as the '@CAPS2' F word or other vulgar terms to describe how mad he is. If you were to just hear those for the first time being yelled at you there is a chance you would have a break down or be ineffective for work. Now im not saying we should all 'cuss' every day and talk in vulgar tongue. Im just saying that the real world doesnt have a 'clean' version. there is no mom or dad there to stand by and say, 'oh no thats not acceptable speech son'. If you took a survey of daily langauge of teens and young adults almost @PERCENT1 90% would say they use some form of vulgar langauge or inapporiate terms. We need to have our kids and teens to know its not ok to say those things and they need to know what is acceptable in society and not. but taking from them in the library and then thrusting them in a world with daily inapproite acts in not right, as it deprives them of the opportunity to develop coping mechanisms and understand the context in which such language is used. Ultimately, open access to diverse materials, paired with guidance, better prepares young people for the realities of the world.
222	3199	2	3	Do we have the right to take books? Author Katherine Paterson proves a point by saying 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is saying that if everyone is able to just remove books from the shelf because they have something agaist it then we would hardly have any books at our libraries. Everyone has their own opinions, shaped by beliefs, lifestyles, ways of thinking, culture, and more. I'm sure I could think of certain books, movies, music, and magazines that I dont like and could just do without. Does that mean I want to totally rid the world of those certain materials? It sure wouldnt bother me but that would be extreamly selfish. Even if something is totally innopropriate and offensive it is still information. Maybe it shouldnt go in the little kids section of a library or store but i dont think it should be removed completely. Music especially has wide ranges from rap, rock, oldies, screamo, classical, country, alternative and the list goes on. I dispise country; I go for the alternative and classical music. I know a lot of people who love it though. All the old people i know hate all the rap. Most of it is pretty offensive but thats just how things are. So no, I dont think anyone should have the right to remove anything from anywhere just because they personally find it offensive. We cant hide from the world. I think people should be open to new things and understand that not everyone likes the same things. If we remove thing materials we dont care for, others will remove the ones you like and so on. So then were left with nothing. Just like freedom of speech we should have the freedom to read, listen to, and watch what we enjoy, because censorship ultimately leads to a barren intellectual landscape where no one's preferences are truly represented.
223	3200	2	3	I believe that censorship should be allowed when it comes to certain things but I don't believe censorship belongs in public libraries. Books are written to stimulate the imagination of a person's mind and if they cannot read books that are the slightest offensive, then they will never know what it is like to open some of the greatest books ever written until that person has grown up. And there are several studies that show that books stimulate the human mind and taking away these books would be a crushing blow to those statistics. For example, a student has been assigned a report on a piece of classical literature. So he/she goes to the public library to find a good book, but when that student gets there he/she finds out that all pieces of classical literature have been removed from the library due to being overly offensive. What would that person do? Should he/she just give up because every single piece of classical literature has been taken out of every library in the country, I say no! This is a problem because almost every great book ever written has at least a few parts where it is slightly offensive to a certain reader. From personal experience I can back this statement up with books I have read going through my school career. For example, when I was in the 8th grade I was assigned a book report over Huckleberry Finn, so I went to our library in the school to look for this book and it was nowhere to be found. I asked the librarian where this book was and she said that it had been removed due to being offensive to the black population for having the word negro imprinted on its pages. So I asked her if I could go to the public library to get the book and she said that it had been removed from its shelves as well. I did not know what to do, I was completely clueless and I had no book to write my report over. So eventually the teacher had to change the report topic because not one student was able to find Huckleberry Finn. But if the state had not allowed these books to be taken off of the shelves then we would not have had this problem. Another example was when my friend John wanted to learn about his culture and where his ancestors came from. But when he got to the library he could not find any books over the arabic world. So he asked the librarian 'where are all the books covering Iraq, Iran, and Syria?' And the librarian said that they were all removed because after 9/11 the CAPS1 saw arabs as very offensive people and that no books were left unchecked. I'm sure that he found this comment to be very offensive but there was nothing that he could do about it because the white people found arabs to be offensive and unequal to the white race. These are only a few things that have already happened because of people finding certain books to be offensive, which is why I believe that the government should leave all the books on the shelves and let the people decide to pick up that book or pass it by. Sure people have a freedom of speech but it should not effect what books belong on the shelf. Which is why I believe that censorship should not be allowed to affect libraries of the public, and the freedom to access diverse literature should be protected to encourage intellectual growth and understanding.
224	3201	2	3	Censorship in Libraries Libraries have alot of things on the library shelves that you might be concerned about. You might be wondering why they don't take the bad stuff off the library shelves. On the library shelves it contains books, music, movies, and magazines. Some things are like what pictures it contains, launguage it contains, and what kind of advertising.  Some things I have expierenced is with the launguage it contains. I have seen some books, magazines, music, and movies have are cusswords. Also some might have racism things in it that you don't like. Another thing is that libraries have some bad persuading such as bad things that you hear or see and you wonder what it would be like to do that stuff.  Also another thing are advertisements. Some things a magazine can contain are about advertising tobacco, such as its good for you to try. Other ads are alcohol ads like a picture of someone with a beer or whiskey in libraries hand, and we think its cool to try it, but its not. The last thing that is really bad in advertisement is drug advertisement, such as a picture of a drug leaf, or inscents. It is bad to do drugs because it can ruin you whole career in high school and maybe in college.  The last thing are pictures and scenes. In movies, libraries could be scenes that you don't approve of. In some magazines libraries can be pictures in which you don't approve in either. So things that I have seen are pictures and scenes in movies and magazines that have innapropiate scenes, and innapropiate pictures.  Some things are like what pictures it contains, launguage it contains, and what kind of advertising libraries have. On the library shelves it contains books, music, movies, and magazines. You might be wondering why they don't take the bad stuff off the library shelves. Libraries have alot of things on the library shelves that you might be concerned about. So, while libraries offer a wealth of information, it's important to be aware of potentially problematic content and consider the impact it might have.
225	3202	2	3	Books that are found offensive should not be taken off of library shelves. Books tell stories, fiction or non-fiction. Many books that may be found offensive are historical. These books could include topics such as wars, eras, people, etc. Everyone has the same rights to read any book they want. They also have the right to not read the book at all. Books that are taken off the shelves of a library because of one person, or a group of people, hinders the ability of someone who wants to read the book, to read the book. We, as people, should not be able to take this right away from other people. They should be able to read anything they want. If someone wants to read a biography or history about HITLER, they should be able to. The topic of HITLER and the NAZI PARTY may be found to be offensive because of what they stand for. If we look at the topic as purely a historical reference, not as a story to be read for enjoyment, there will never be any offense in these books. These stories have a large role in history. If we do not learn from their mistakes, history may repeat itself. History is around to be studied, even if the topics might be offensive to some people. Political correctness can not always be followed when writing a story. Such as in To KILL a MOCKINGBIRD. This book has many issues when it comes to political correctness. These issues include; the killing of an innocent man and revealing the flaws in our judicial system, the use of the word 'nigger' to describe the black characters, and the racial inequality of the SOUTH during the 1930's. These issues would definitely be offensive to some readers, but this book is an award winner and uses history as a guide. The situations in this novel are ones that could be real. They are things we must learn about, so we do not repeat them. Another story that fits quite well into this topic is FAHRENHEIT 451. This novel is about a world where all books are burnt. No books are allowed to be read by the people. This book reveals the removal of offensive books to its extreme. No matter who you are or what you believe, there will be some topics that you find offensive. If we remove every book that someone finds offensive we will have no books on the shelves of any library. A library is not a library without its books. If we allow books to begin to be removed from the shelves, we will not be able to stop it. One day we will end up like the world in FAHRENHEIT 451. No history will be known but what is passed down. No more stories will be here to entertain us, but the ones memorized. No books will exist and this world would be terrible without books. Books that are found to be offensive should not be taken off of library shelves. The taking away of these books takes away the freedom to read anything you want. It reduces the chances we have to learn and to flourish. Political correctness should not take the place of our own freedom, and as long as we keep our books on their shelves, it won't. Protecting the freedom to access diverse perspectives, even those considered offensive, is essential for an informed and intellectually vibrant society.
226	3203	2	3	I believe that libraries should have more censorship. Some books, magazines, and movies should be removed or grouped by age. From my own experiences of reading or seeing people read these books, I believe they should be removed because they influence violence, sexual activity, and drug use. Young children should not be exposed to those things yet. First, I think books that contain violence should be removed. I believe that children are the easiest people to influence. I also believe that violence is the worst thing to be influenced by. Violence in books can influence killing. Fighting and killing is not good. No young child should be able to check out books full of shooting and fighting. The book will make the kids think that's the right thing to do if they are able to check it out. Being influenced by violence will make you commit crimes. Reading a book is not worth going to jail for. Violent content can desensitize children, potentially leading to aggressive behavior. Next, I believe that all sexual activity material should be removed from libraries. Sexual activity should not be exposed to children until it is time for them to start learning about it. For example, a young girl reading about teen pregnancy not being a problem. The reader will think that is what she is supposed to do, which is wrong. Books and magazines containing sexually explicit words should not be able to be viewed by young children. Those things influence kids to do things they should not even be thinking about doing. You can at least sort them all in an adult section, ensuring that younger readers are not prematurely exposed to mature themes. Finally, drug use should not be issued in books to kids. Children should not read or watch anything that are talking about drugs in a positive way. Unless it is about saying no to drugs and not using them, children should not read them at all. Drugs make people do things that their right mind don't want them to do. Children should say no to drugs and to books that are influencing the opposite. Early exposure to positive portrayals of drug use can normalize harmful behaviors, making it crucial to shield children from such content. In conclusion, that is why I believe that we need censorship in our libraries. We need censorship because of violence and drug use, and also because of sexual activity and many more things. Protecting children from potentially harmful content is vital for their healthy development and well-being.
227	3204	2	3	Dear newspaper and staff, It has came to my attention that our community's libraries are being considered to undergo a removal and or censorship of some books this month. I find this not acceptable; in my opinion this is an attempt to mislead or perhaps hide previous evidence of offensive reading material from further generations. For example, a personal favorite of mine is a book labled ' A Black Boy' , this book describes a childs heartships and the abuse he takes on a daily basics. Books of this sort are not only imformitive it also gives the reader an open mind on how things might have been. Some topics this month include; slavery, abuse, war, and discrimation.  These topics today are still among the things that happen in today's society. Censoring and removal of these book are pointless; for the simple reason that at least three of the four are a current issue. It is strickly important for our generations to be aware of the heartships, problems, and lessons in which these topics araised. Without imforming our generations of these issues it could result in a repeat of history, which we as a country are trying to prevent!  My opinion on movies however are a little different. I believe some movies are okay; but they must not contain obvious and purpose acts of discrimnation and or offesive material. Most movies nowadays if they are offesive in a relating way to the movie then they are rated at least PG 13 or rated R 17 this allows certain age groups able to watch material that this month be offesive or perhaps discrimating. They this month also need adult combinations to preview the movie.  So in my closing i would like for you to consider my opinion as a wise outlook on offensive/ discrimating issues. I just fully believe open school content is allowed at certain ages, depending on the content. Plently observations must be made by parents/ guradians if needed. I appreatiate your time and understanding of my letter! Thanks! Sincerly, John Smith- School Official
228	3205	2	3	Everyone today gets offended daily. So to go to a library and see offensive material on the shelves is no different than the rest of the day. However, there are those minds, which have not been polluted and influenced by these offensive materials, that should have a right to keep their minds that way.  One solution to the problem could be that we start rating books and magazines like we do for movies. The material rated for adults gets put in one area of the library while the lower rated material is put on display for the public. The higher rated can be put in an area that is not seen everyday by the public, and is kept secret thus protecting the uninfluenced minds and the people wanting said material can still have their way.  Another solution might be to just get rid of the censored material. It, in my opinion and experience, corrupts both the mind and soul, and causes man to be things he is not by nature. Men, who have nothing better to do than to sit and read or look at things meant for inside of marriage, often accomplish nothing of great value in their lifetime. They are thus a hindrance to society. But if they cannot access the material, they then need something to do to fill that time. In which case they can find a good classic to read or maybe pick up that dusty atlas off the shelf.  This thus leaves the libraries with a choice. They can leave their library the way that they want, they can put the offensive material in a secluded room, or they can remove definite offensive material and keep society on its feet accomplishing great feats for the next generation to observe. Thus the amount of offending someone goes down and maybe the library attendance goes up, ultimately leading to a more productive and less easily offended society.
229	3206	2	3	Have you ever found or seen books, music, movies, or magazines in a library that are offensive to you? If so, then would you have wanted to remove it off of the shelf so none of your children or anyone else that might have found it offensive, to see it? Well, I have actually gone to the library and seen some things that was offensive to me, and I have also heard my family members talking about it. So I am going to talk about what I have heard about my family seeing or finding books, music, movies, and magazines offensive. Also, I am going to explain how I felt and what i wanted to do when i seen those things in a library that was offensive to me. The last thing that I am going to talk about is how I feel on censorship in libraries. First, I have been hearing from my sisters, my mother, and my step-mother about how they find some books, music, movies, and magazines at a library that was offensive to them. Now I do not know exactly what the books, magazines, etc., was that they found offensive but I do know what they thought about them and what they wanted to do. So one day, my sisters, mother, and step-mother was talking about a couple of books that she found offensive. They never said what the books were but they kept talking about how they felt and what they would have liked to do with them. Now she told my family and I that she was badly offended by what they were called and what they were about. Also she was saying that she would have really liked to have taken the books, music, movies, etc., off of the shelves, so other people that might have found them offensive would not see them. But, they all did also agree on the fact that they really do not have the right to remove them from the shelves. Their reason why they do not have that right is because of there are a lot of people who they do not know if they find it offensive or not. The people who do not find it offensive might actually want to read them. So, they just agreed to look past them and ignore what is there if it offends them for the people who do not find them offensive. Now, from my point of view from finding or seeing books, music, movies, magazines, etc., in a library that are or was offensive to me. There have been a couple of times where I have walked in a library where I found a couple of books that was offensive towards me. I really did not like what the books were all about and called, and I really would have liked to take them off the shelves and throw them away so no other person who might have found them offensive would find them or see them. So what if there are other people who would have actually wanted to read those books? That was what I thought about when I was tempted to actually remove them. So I decided not to remove the books from the shelves, so the people who did not find them offensive could read them, if they wanted to. I respected the fact that there are other people that are out there that would want to read those books but at the same time, I knew that there are people who could find them offensive but I just thought that they would just ignore the fact that they are there. So, on to the last thing that I am going to talk about. Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves, at a library, if they are found offensive? Also my views on censorship in libraries. Well I do believe that they should be removed so they wpuld not be offending anyone that walked into that library. But, if people had the right to remove books or anything that is offensive towards them, then there would literally be no books left in the libraries. Then there would not be any point in having libraries or in anyone writing books. So then again, I do not believe that any person should have a right to just remove the books that are offensive to them at all. I belive that if they find a book that is offensive to them, then they should just ignore that it is there and respect that there are a lot of people out there who would want to or like to read those books. I believe that libraries are meant to be places of diverse perspectives, and removing materials based on personal offense would severely limit intellectual freedom. So I do not believe that there should be any censorship in libraries at all. It is not anyones fault that people find books, music, movies, magazines, etc., offensive to them. So no, there should absolutely not be any censorship in a library. So there, I have just explained my views on censroship in libraries and if I believe that people should have the right to remove books from a shelf just cause they found it offensive. Like I
230	3207	2	3	No, books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should not be simply taken off of the shelves or out of stores, even if some find them offensive. These items are made to relay a message, express a point of view, or state an opinion, and everyone has different perspectives. All of these things are rated. Movies are rated @CAPS1 through @CAPS2, books are categorized from child to adult, and music, if explicit, has a parental advisory sticker, so just follow the ratings. If a four-year-old tried to buy tickets to a rated @CAPS2 movie, the theater wouldn't sell them because of the age restriction. People might bring up the concern that a child could pick up an adult book or magazine in a store. The solution is simple: create a separate, clearly labeled adult section in stores. Employ cameras for monitoring, or have an ID check at the entrance. These items are expressions of a person's dreams, hopes, desires, fantasies, and heart, and they shouldn't be denied expression because someone deems them unfit. And, most apparent, if it offends you, don't consume it. By simply following the rating rules and taking necessary precautions, businesses and libraries should have no problems keeping everybody safe and happy, while still allowing access to a wide range of materials.
231	3208	2	3	If I could remove anything from shelves of libraries I wouldn't. Would you rather your kids to learn things from the facts or learn from friends? Censoring books, magazines, movies, etc and what goes onto the shelves are mostly for enjoyment or informational. Granted you wouldn't want a five-year old reading a book made for adults, but with age kids would have to learn things. You can't always control what children read unless you plan on going with them everywhere including college and on into their adult life. Books provide facts and more reliable information than what you can hear from people. If all the books on the shelves relating to drugs or alcohol were pulled off, how would someone write a report on those things? The books were created to provide people, kids especially, with facts that no one else could share and it could help with expanding their vocabulary and knowledge. If someone were to find a book offensive, they don't have to look at it or even pick it up. Libraries can't always suit everyone's tastes and something you might find offensive isn't to others. Taking a single book from the shelves would result in others taking books off the shelves and then no books would be left for anyone to read or wish to take off the shelves.  If you controlled what everyone read, no one would be happy and their brain wouldn't function correctly. You'd be taking one of their rights, one of the only things entitled to them without someone else telling them they can't. What kids read is shaping their minds for their future. If you removed their favorite series or genre from the shelves, they wouldn't read or listen to music or anything anymore because it isn't enjoyable. Kids get into reading when they can enjoy what they read or listen to.  So with that, I wouldn't take anything off the shelves because everything appeals to someone in one way or another. Controlling what one person reads doesn't lead you nor the other person anywhere, someone could end up being offended if you take something you find offensive off the shelves, and you can't stop the knowledge that books can provide people if they read them. In one way or another something provides information for people, which is why diverse collections are so important in libraries.
232	3209	2	3	Hi my name is @PERSON1 I have a couple topics that I would like to talk to you about. I have been hearing alot of people talking about libraries taking alot of there stuff off the shelves well I think that that the libraries around the world have alot of information inside of them and if we started taking information out of them then what would be the point in having them. I think that everything in libraries are very important and who is to know that everybody wants this to happen. The one thing that I dont really think that libraries need in them is movies because like pretty much every movie has a book that goes with it or is the same thing pretty much. And lets get on with the whole offensive thing I think everone should be mature about all the negative stuff people can say even if it is hurtfull. Though I think that the more people read about what people are saying about them is the less that they are goin to care because they are goin to just be so used to it that they are not even going to know what they are talking about. If there was one thing that I could tel the world it would be dont be offened by what people say to you, because in the end, developing resilience to offensive remarks is key to navigating a world filled with diverse opinions.
233	3210	2	3	You gotta admit, although you would like your kids to have freedom, not all of them are responsible enough to handle it. You could blabber in their ear all day about 'being responsible to do this and not do that,' and they will go out and do it anyways. Trust me, I'm a teenager. I know. So there are certain things that you have to take away from them in order to keep them from getting distracted on what truly matters in their teenage years. And that is schoolwork. If school systems allowed there to be offensive or inappropriate materials on their shelves, I just know kids would find themselves to be...well... 'distracted'. And when I say inappropriate, I don't only mean on sexual terms, I mean inappropriate for school. You would like to think that they would possibly save it for when they checked out and went home and did their work first but, like I stated before, kids are going to do what they want. And what they want to do is 99% of the time not schoolwork. They would rather just sit down, crack open a magazine, and let their eyes glaze over at the sights of celebrities and new scandals. School work is a very important thing in teenagers lives, and I feel that when they are in school they should stay focused on schoolwork and activities. If they wanted to have free time to go and read magazines, they should do it at home. Offensive books should not be there to only distract the teenager from school. It's unnecessary. But with public libraries, it's a whole new story. I believe that nothing should be censored from a public library because people go there on their own free will. I know I personally go there for research and for the sheer joy of reading, as do many other people. It's your choice if you are responsible enough to keep focused on work or get distracted because not only do teenagers go there, but adults do too. It is unacceptable for there to be only educational books because who knows what your there for? The library is for people to go and read, whether it's just for the heck of it or for school. Not everyone is responsible. Especially not teenagers. So that's why I personally believe offensive or inappropriate materials should not be allowed in school libraries, but allowed in public libraries. Although equal rights and freedom in necessary, schoolwork is too important to let kids get distracted from it. It is the key to their future; therefore, it is crucial to protect their focus during school hours.
234	3211	2	3	All people have the same right to read, listen, and watch different materials. To be censored should be no one's choice but your own. For someone else to tell you what to read and what not to read is, in my opinion, very wrong to do. If we would censor everything we did, we would have a city and nation that would degrade slowly. Any given word can offend a certain person. The people that they offend are, in my opinion, the dead weights of our country that are just holding us back from fully expressing ourselves; the colorful words that we often use can be offensive to one person yet perfectly fine to another. It all depends on the individual that likes or dislikes the word or readings. In my observations of people reading and disliking it because of its harsh and colorful words, it is most often people that do not fully express themselves and are yet much more sensitive. I think this also goes against freedom of speech. We were given that right, so why wouldn't we use it? Why wouldn't people want us to express ourselves? I have no idea why any person would want to take books, music, movies, and magazines away from us. If everything went by one man's rule of what to read and not to read, we would downgrade as a country. Therefore, I strongly advise not to take any books off the shelves. The majority of the people agree with me to not be censored, and only the sensitive people that they offend will just make their own choice not to pick the book off the shelves, not to listen to music, and pick up the magazine; the right is ours, and that's how it should stay, allowing us to maintain our individual freedoms and continue progressing as a society.
235	3212	2	3	Censorship. It's a word that everyone has heard, but do people truly know what it means or how it effects them? In the past, books have been censured by rulers and leaders who thought that the material was harmful. How could they say that they knew what was best for their people? What gave them the right to decide what their people could or could not read? In today's society, we still have to deal with censorship issues. There are still people who believe that libraries need to censor their books. Censorship is wrong. Books, magazines, movies, music, etc. should not be removed from the shelves just because certain people find them offensive. Everyone has different tastes, not only in food, but in every other part of their lives as well. No one person has the right to say that one genre is better than another. Censorship is wrong because it limits what people can read, watch, and listen to.  Censorship should not be allowed because it limits what people can read. Some people like mysteries, while others like to read romantic books. If we allow people to censor what we read, then how can we say that there is a book for everyone to like? If libraries censored every book that might offend someone else, then there would not be any books left for anyone to read. For example, certain religious books might offend people of other religions, but that does not mean that we should take them off the shelves. If we did that, we would have to take away all religious books so that no one was offended. Then no one would be able to find books about their religion, and no one would benefit.  Similarly, censorship limits what people can watch. If we removed every movie that had even one tiny part that offended someone else, there would be no more movies left in the world. Every movie is going to have something that someone will love and someone will hate. If we only focus on the person who hates it and get rid of movies based on the people who hate them, then the people who love the movies will suffer for it. People who love horror movies probably hate comedies. This does not mean that we need to get rid of comedies just because that there are some people who dislike them. It only means that the people who don't like that type of movie don't have to watch them.  In the exact same way, censorship keeps people from enjoying the type of music that they love. We can't censor music because everyone has different types and genres that they like. If we take away one kind of music, then we have to take away every kind of music. It is not fair to say that we can censor one genre of music because some people dislike it or find it offensive when there are people who truly enjoy listening to that type of music. It would be unfair to those people, and if we are unfair to them, we have to be unfair to everybody. People would be even more offended than before in that case.  There will always be unhappy people in the world. We should not result to censoring books, movies, and music in libraries and other places just to try make people happy. Censorship in libraries limits what people can enjoy. It makes the people who would like the items that have been censored mad. We should not result to that. We should allow people to pick what they like. If a person want to read something they should be allowed. If they want to watch a certain movie or listen to a certain song, then why not let them? The slim margin of people who dislike what those people enjoy can just avoid reading, watching, or listening to it. We can't take something away from the people who love it just because someone is unhappy, and we must remember that freedom of choice and expression are essential components of a thriving society.
236	3213	2	3	I believe that some materials are offensive to some people, but that shouldn't give them a right to want to take it off the shelves. No, I do not agree with taking them off the shelves because people could easily overlook them and not read them. Some people this month think they are offensive but they should know that they are not directed towards them. Magazines are different because they have peoples faces on the front cover which is uncalled for. Some of those people have a family, and doesn't want them to see their face on the front cover of a magazine. Katherine Paterson's quote is about wanting to remove books from the shelves so that children won't be tempted to read them. If this is the case I think that it's not the right thing to do. Some of those books people are taking off the shelves could be the book someone can use to relate to or even learn from. Whether or not you want your children to read them or not they could still find them and ask why they have never seen it before and parents wouldn't know what to say. Libraries are a resource to people that want to read and learn about new things. If you took a book off of a shelf, that could be the book someone really needs. Don't be that person to take away from a child's learning. You never know who is going to look for what your have taken away. And if you take it away they this month never find it. Some people believe that reading something can be an influence to the way they act, but you cannot blame that on reading. That's like saying that your favorite color is lime green because that's someone's favorite color. It's not true and it sure isn't right. What would you do if your parents hid a book or something else from you? You would be mad at them and wonder why. It would make you anxious to read it. If they didn't hide it and you found it maybe you wouldn't want to read it because your parents would have let you see it and you wouldn't be interested. You have your own choice when it comes to what your children read, watch, and listen to. Just don't shut them out of what you read because you were offended. Think about it, the music, movie, or book your hiding from them could be the answer to a lot of things; it could help them figure out the path they want to take, or maybe the path they don't want to take. Either way it would help them be a success in their life, so why not take the risk? It could even help you, and provide unexpected insights.
237	3214	2	3	Censorship in the world we live in today is a very interesting concept. With the advent of social media, we now have thriving communities of people that want their voice to be heard, and people are listening. We now are able to tap into the huge ammount of knowledge from people all around the world, allowing us to see what is really happening in countries like China, where media is considered treason. What do we do now that governments are starting to censor the internet? Lets start by looking an arguement that has been long talked about: library censorship. Today, it is almost a requirement for cities to have public libraries to be considered as real cities. Public libaries, and the funding they require, are not anywhere within the United Nations. Even so, they have taken a place in our neighborhoods that has made them indefinate sources of knowledge and culture. One public library may be a source of; historical town records, children's books, novels, research papers, non-fiction books, fiction books, magazines, and many other types of entertainment and knowledge. Public libraries are, even with the widespread usage of the internet, important places for us, as residents of a city, to socialize and learn. Libraries today may carry books that were in the past on the 'banned books' list, but that does not mean books are not being banned from libraries. Libaries are generally family institutions, and as being funded by the public, required to adhear by the moral and ethical standards of those who live in the area. This means that there is not one, 'national banned books list', but there many discrepencies througout America in banning books. As culture moves more and more into more and more questionable materials, libaries are faced with a tough decision; keep up with the times and have more questionable and controversial reading material, or get lost in the past and try to kling onto the senior generation to stay alive. Bringing new literary materials into the library that is fresh and new means that more people will return to the library again, be it young-adults or older adults trying to get in touch with the current world. One major controversy of books in public libaries are the inclusion of sexual intimacy. As a new generation sprouts, fed with music lyrics by such names as; 'Cardi B', or 'Megan Thee Stallion', we enter a new age where younger and younger kids are learning about sex. The authors of today have recognised this and have started to include references to sexual intimacy, but not detailed encoutners. I believe this is fine, because as we move on in generations we are going to find out that education about sex; safe sex, birth control, STD prevention and testing, is much more important than trying to keep children ignorant. Keeping these young adults involved in books and trying to continue their learning outside of school is a much larger issue we should be trying to tackle instead of trying to create silly arguments against new reading material in a public libary. Public libaries are the centerpiece for learning outside of school in many communities, small and large. Knowing this, how could anyone truly believe that it would be smart to stop including new books that would entice new patrons? Even as a commercial buisness, this would make no sense, simply turning people away because you have a single view of what the future is and you refuse to listen to anyone else's opinion of the future. So why is there a question on including new knowledge? Isn't it obivous that we, as a nation, should show the world that we aren't living in the past, and that we value the intellectual growth of our young people? That we are indeed the future of the world, and that our young-adults will recieve the best education in the world by not only learning in schools, but by being the most active readers, and by extension, learners in the world.
238	3215	2	3	I do not believe that materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves simply because they are offensive. My opinion is that removal should only occur if the content is so inappropriate that children should not have access to it. The reason for this is that what one reader finds offensive, another might not, as their standards differ. If someone chooses to check out a book they find offensive, they are aware of the content and its potential impact. Therefore, removing books based on offensiveness is not justified, because offense is subjective. However, my opinion is somewhat divided: if movies and library materials are inappropriate for children, access should be restricted to adults only. Many others have different opinions on this subject, but I believe everything should remain available, with movies containing adult content sold exclusively to adults, ultimately allowing individuals to make their own choices about what they consume.
239	3216	2	3	Libraries are a place that provides people of all ages the oppurtunity to read any book, watch any movie, or listen to any music all for free and for a certain period of time. When people grow up, they tend to start reading, watching, and listening to material that they would never let their children listen to. Since books are read privately and movies and music are played publicly, books should not be taken from the shelves and only very bad movies and music should leave the library. Books have always been a way for people to get away from their life and into their own story world. Normally when people read a book, they don't read it in a group unless they are in a reading group discussing certain books. If someone wanted to read a book that was innappropriate for their children, let them do it; it's not hurting the children that they have been reading innappropriate topics, it will only hurt them if that child finds the book that should have been hidden in a better place. For example, @PERSON1 read the book 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2', which had some innappropriate content for a child in there, but not so bad that it would be heinous. @PERSON1 will read the book in her own mind while finding it in the adult section of the library far from children; this scenario is how it should be. Although, if a library is putting adult books near children's books, they need to redesign to keep kids from accidentally walking into the adult section. Books can be kept from kids if hidden well enough, but movies and music can not be hidden in the same manner. Movies and music are a great way to kick back and relax after a long day, unless your kids are around. Keeping kids out of the room is a near impossible task, whether it is actually watching the movie or hearing the movie through his bedroom wall. Music can of course be listened to through headphones, but what happens when you leave a @CAPS3 is left in the car and a child is sent in that car to wait for his parents to get in? The parents might tell their child to start the car for them and the music will be playing away. The movies and music were from the library, a place where the child thinks that there would never be something such disgraceful material as what their parents are watching and listening to, ruining their good thoughts of the library. Libraries need to either get rid of all nasty content pertaining to movies and music or if their main business is that and can't seem to give it up, just put the content as far away as possible from the children. As said above, libraries need to remove all content that has potential to be exposed to children and destroy their innocent minds. Libraries are a place where kids can have fun picking out whatever book they wish to read, not a place where parents can pick up items that might spoil that child's brain, and removing certain media will ensure a safe environment for them.
240	3217	2	3	Whispers and comments fill the room while people make their way throughout the library. The criticizing of books and materials that are neatly stacked in the shelves, are taken and mistreated from the harsh people that think they are offensive. In my point of view, I strongly agree that there is no right to argue about what should or should not be removed in the libraries. The reflecting of my own views along with the libraries, shows interest in the materials for people all over the world. The reason that I, myself, do not believe in this situation is how it's mentioned in Katherine Paterson's passage. It explained, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Everybody around has a unique part about themselves, and that is having a different look on something than someone else might have. This leads into taking a material or book they see, the wrong way and being offensive about it. However, there might be someone else that does not view that same exact book is wrong, but instead, sees something else that could lead to be offensive to them as well.  To make this observation not as confusing, I will share my own experience that might help focus more on my argument. There is a time when I went to the library and saw books and especially magazines throughout, that had an impact on colored people. It described how it would be like, if there was still slavery and that if everybody wasn't taught or treated equal amongst everyone else. In this situation, it could go both ways on how colored people tend to look and feel about this. Maybe the people are relieved and interested, knowing they are free now. On the other hand however, many colored people might get in an awkward position, having no passion of bringing the equality up in the present world, or even the future. Many might want to forget about what happened, instead of books and magazines still publishing articles and stories about it. Again, this argument might go both ways, meaning one less book would be off the shelf, or many would be newly stacked aside from the others.  When people think of materials, they most likely think of something that symbolizes an event, time period, or a symbol itself. This could also have an impact on the censorship in libraries. The way people want to take roll in the things they are part of, might actually be found in the library. However, someone that thinks there is no right for it to be shown, will remove the material. This tends to make the people that thought it was right, not find the interest they wanted to receive.  Another argument people might have is that libraries are a public place, right? Well this should cut back or maybe even add more pull into what they can or can not share within their readings, materials, and movies. People might think that they have a right to argue or take the offensive actions out. Not so quick though as people can prove that they can put anything back as well. Well, instead of picking and choosing, I think everything should be left alone and people should only go to the section of interest they are looking for and leave the other materials out of their view. Protecting access ensures diverse perspectives remain available.  My experience and observations about this argument has covered why I, and all of you, should reflect on the views of censorship the appropriate way in libraries. Not saying this will control all the problems, but it will help from removing all of materials that could have a big roll in future process of teaching children, teachers, and of course, each and everyone. By respecting the presence of all materials, we uphold the library's mission to serve as a hub of diverse knowledge and perspectives for all.
241	3218	2	3	I believe that certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc. shouldn't be removed from the shelves. I say this because, what might be offensive to one person might not come close to being offensive to another. There are many different types of books, movies and even some music that have some history to it, it might be offensive, but to some certain race or culture it's history. What might be historical or even informational to one person it will be offensive to the other and vice versa. If everybody had a chance to go into the biggest library made and take something that might be offensive to them down I think that the library would have little to no books in it. Katherine said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' meaning if parents or teenagers took 'offensive' material off the shelf that there will be nothing else left. A lot of things are offensive because of religion beliefs, but not everybody has the same religion or even a religion at all. Just like religion shouldn't be taught in public schools, censoring shouldn't be allowed in public libraries. If censoring did happen in public libraries, I'm sure there will be protests and possibly riots over this censoring. People said that Hitler was a bad man, well if we take books and movies off the shelves showing what he did, I believe history will be more likely to repeat itself. A lot of things have been bad in history that we read about today, like gangs, if we don't read about the wrong they do or see the movies to show how it would be like if you were a gang member would there be an increase in gang activity and members? This is why I believe we shouldn't take books, magazines, movies, etc. off of the shelves, because limiting access to potentially offensive material ultimately risks erasing important historical lessons and hindering our understanding of diverse perspectives, potentially leading to a repetition of past mistakes.
242	3219	2	3	I believe that libraries should provide any kind of book, magazine, music, and movies to the public, despite if they are found offensive. First, to support my position, we need to take into consideration that every person is different, and therefore reads and prefers different types of books and magazines. The same thing applies for watching movies and listening to music. Second, what may seem 'offensive' to one person may be perfectly fine for another, so the term 'offensive' is ambiguous in this case. There is no need for an angry public or strikes. Finally, I believe that the people have a free choice when choosing the types of books and magazines to be read, the types of movies to be watched, and the types of music to be listened to. After all, it is for their own benefit, entertainment, and learning. So, libraries should not have anything offensive removed from their shelves that are found offensive. First, we need to take into consideration that every person is different, and therefore prefers different types of materials provided by a library. For example, one person may like to read philosophical books, and the other may like to read romance comedy books. If the philosophical books were to be taken off the shelves by the library officials, then the person who likes philosophy will not have anything to read. Yes, there are magazines available and movies to watch about philosophy, but they are experienced and learned differently than reading Plato's book, or Aristotle's Ethics. I had an experience similar to this with my friend. She preferred horror movies, and I historical. The horror movie she was looking for was not in the library, and later it turned out that the library did not have any kind of horror movie because they weren't popular in that city. My friend was not happy. The library had historical movies, but I ended up watching that by myself. So, libraries should not have to take away any sort of material that might be offensive to the public. Second, the term 'offensive' in this case is ambiguous, meaning that it has multiple meanings. What may seem 'offensive' to one person may not seem offensive to another. An example: a Sports Illustrated magazine cover may be offensive to a child because of the picture and 'adult' words for the child. However, that same cover may be interesting to a young adult because he may be into surfing, suntanning, or sports. Offensive is only used in the first part, but not in the second, and the same material was used. So, should that magazine be removed? I don't think so. The solution is for the child to look at Highlights Magazines, National Geographic, or Lego magazines. The library should provide a section for National Geographic so that they can read appropriate material. Finally, I believe that the people have a free choice when choosing the books to read, the type of movies to watch, and the types of music to listen to. They should be allowed to do this because of their differences and their definition of 'offensive'. People should not be forced to read the same type of book, to watch the same type of movies, or to listen to the same type of music. They should have a choice of choosing the materials provided by the library which corresponds to their personalities. After all, the materials they see, read, or listen to is for their own benefit, their own learning, and for their own entertainment. The main goal is for them to be happy with what the library has to offer. In conclusion, I believe that libraries should not take off any material from their shelves that are found offensive. This is due to the different people, the ambiguous term for 'offensive', the for the sake of human flourishment. Libraries are for studying, learning, and entertainment in a quiet, peaceful place. They should not discourage people to discontinue learning about the world because that would lead to a bigger and more serious worldwide problem: the lack of education.
243	3220	2	3	Katherine Paterson believes that if she can take a book off the shelf that she doesn't like anyone can. That should be the right way, but I don't agree. I don't think people should be able to take a book off the shelf just because they find it offensive. They don't have to take the book. I don't believe there should be censorship in libraries. If people find a book offensive they don't have to look at it or check it out. Other people might enjoy that book. Likeing a book is an opinion. For exmaple, if someone doesn't like your outfit you're probably not going to go and burn it or throw it away because that is just that one persons opinion. That is how it goes with movies, books, music, and magazines. Everyone likes something different so their should be different books.  When you don't like a book I beleive the only time it would be right for you to take that book off the shelf would be if it was in your house. Then you can take that book off the shelf and throw it away or whatever you want to do with that book. If you had the whole town vote to get rid of a book and ninety-five percent voted to get rid of that book then I think it would be okay. You can't just think about yourself when it comes to public things, you need to think about the whole community and what the majority wants.  I read an article about banning '@PERSON2' from schools, I didn't think that would be a good idea. '@PERSON2' was one of the top picked books by high school students. If parents didn't like their kids reading it they should have just told them not to read it. I don't think it's right for parents to just go in the school and say they didn't like that book and take it off the shelf. It's not fair to other readers who enjoy reading '@PERSON2 @PERSON2'.  Choosing what book to read is your opinion so you don't have to read a book you dislike. People like all different books so it's not fair for them to not able to read the book they like just because other people don't like the book. What If someone didn't like a book that you loved? Would they just be able to take it off the shelf? Ultimately, allowing diverse viewpoints and respecting individual choices is crucial for maintaining an open and inclusive literary environment.
244	3221	2	3	
245	3222	2	3	Yes, I do think materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from bookshelves if they are found offensive, because why keep items that are offensive to young kids and other people on there? If something doesn't have anything to do with learning, then it probably shouldn't be there. There are certain things kids should read, so if adults want to include materials made for adults, then those should be in a separate section from the kids' section. They also shouldn't have any music or movies that have violence in them, because kids these days are exposed to too much violence as it is. The only way music or movies should be included is if they have learning materials in them. So, I think you should only put books, music, movies, and magazines on the shelf if they contain learning materials and things that would persuade them to do something positive in their life. Ultimately, a curated selection of materials can help guide children towards constructive and educational paths.
246	3223	2	3	Libraries contain diverse materials like books, movies, magazines, and tape recorders. Books are categorized as fiction or nonfiction. The issue arises when some materials are deemed offensive. However, libraries should not remove these items. The decision of what to check out rests with the library customers, not the authors, as the authors have released their work for public consumption. Blaming the authors is not appropriate. We have different writers and artists. They spend a lot of time to write books or series for us to read or hear. Some books might be fiction or nonfiction.  Another reason libraries should not remove items is that offense is subjective. For example, slavery is offensive to many but viewed as history by others. Understanding historical events requires access to information. People should read the introduction before checking out the book to know if they like it or not. Removing materials based on potential offense is not the answer.  If a child checks out a book with parental permission, the responsibility lies with the parents. If someone objects to certain materials, they can voice their concerns, but that doesn't justify removing the item, as others may find value in it. Libraries are resources for accessing information, and censorship through removal undermines their purpose. Therefore, libraries should remain spaces where diverse perspectives and materials are accessible, leaving the choice of what to engage with to the individual reader.
247	3224	2	3	Why is censorship important in libraries? Why should we care if there is censorship at all? I am here to tell you today my views and opinions on censorship at the library. When you walk into a library I assume you would expect a public area where you can read books and check them out, but what happens when you browse through these books and you find something offensive? How do you act, and what should you do? In my opinion censorship is alright but only used when needed. Censorship protects children and young adults from viewing things that are adult eyes only such as horror books, offensive music, and in most cases pornography. Censorship in the library is an important role because anyone can go into a library and pick up any book, but when you have an adults-only section for books, movies, music, etc., it stops a lot of people from having to worry about their kids seeing bad things. For instance, if twelve-year-old @PERSON1 goes into a library and finds a video game with large amounts of violence in it he can check it out and play the game without his parents' knowledge of the incident. With censorship, we eliminate such problems, providing a safer environment for younger patrons.  Now like I stated before censorship is ok when needed, because censorship can get carried away as well. In reality, it's the parents' fault of why their kids do things also like letting their kids listen to music with heavy swearing or full access to a personal computer. Things like that are creating problems for parents as well as people around them. When I say censorship is ok when needed I mean people censor important information on the account of an event that has happened in the past. Another example, if you're in ninth grade and you enter a library for a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 movie but it's too graphic the student is stranded for a source and must gain access to a computer, potentially hindering their learning.  Now that you have my opinions and beliefs you can get a better understanding of what I mean. Censorship is a good thing but it can also be a bad one as well. I think that if censorship is controlled correctly it can become a powerful tool in any library, school, and even home. Censorship is at times out of control but maintained we can use it for many things and have a great community as well as a country.  In essence, censorship is ok to an extent and you should believe this as well just because if you think long enough you too can see what I see, that a balanced approach to censorship can foster both protection and access to information.
248	3225	2	3	Some of the most interesting books that I have ever read are offensive in some way. I have even read excellent books that offend me. If we didn't have books and stories that offend us, then we would never really find out what offends us. That is why I don't think books, magazines, music, or anything of that nature that might be found offensive in some way should be removed from the shelves. If you think about it, almost all books can be offensive or hurt your feelings. It just depends on how you feel about what has been written. Something that is offensive to one person or a group of people might not be found offensive by another person or group of people. If we took all the books off of the shelves that someone said offended them, then there would be no books left. Writing is something you do when you want to express how you feel, or tell a story about yourself or someone else. Some authors might do this in a very offensive manner. Others might try to sugar-coat how they feel about a person or certain idea. Either way you could still find something about the writing to be offensive. In conclusion, I feel that books that are found offensive or hurtful should be left on the shelves because, if we took all of them off, there would not be a very wide selection of books left, and we'd lose opportunities for learning and understanding different perspectives.
249	3226	2	3	Many places show and sell offensive material. It is found almost everywhere. Many people try to shelter their kids from it but the truth is if the kids really want to look at it they are going to find a way. So I do not think all offensive material should be removed from shelves but sometimes things can offend more than one person in which case they might need to be removed. Take music for example, there can be explicit lyrics in songs but that doesn't make them terrible or make them worth taking off the shelf. Music is everywhere and if someone tells you can't listen to it over a few words then they are going to find a way to listen to it. Movies could be different. For some you do have to be a certain age and that is because of the offensive material. But still some people go see it anyways knowing that there will be offensive material in there but they go and see it and then complain about how offensive it was. Movies should not be pulled off the shelf because it is your choice if you want to watch it or not and if you choose not to there will always be someone who chooses to watch it. Books might be the only exception. Many people read books and many do enjoy it but many people do find books offensive. Now with music and movies people know they aren't real its just talk or acting. But some books are written by people with the actual beliefs they write about, which is why some books might be pulled off shelves because if one person believes something it won't be hard to convince somebody else. There is a big difference between choosing not to look or listen to something than being told you cannot look at something. All the things that show explicit material have some type of warning for it and if you choose to keep reading or listening it is your decision. Therefore, while offensive material is pervasive, censorship should be approached cautiously, reserving the removal of content primarily for instances where the potential for real-world harm through persuasion is significant.
250	3227	2	3	Censorship in libraries in my view isn't a good idea. Libraries now days have a lot of offensive language in their books, so if someone were to take all of the books like that out of the library, the library wouldn't even have that many books in it. Music is the same way; all music now days might have some offensive words in them; that's just something people now days have to get over. I think library censorship is not a good idea. Some parents might not like the idea of their libraries having offensive language in the books, music, movies, and magazines. If the parents don't want their children to read those books, then they need to choose their children's books, but I think taking all the offensive books off the shelves isn't very smart, because some people enjoy reading and listening to that kind of music.  Some of the best books and music now days have bad stuff in them like drugs, language, sex, gangs and much more, but sometimes books like that can teach you a lesson on how to avoid that going down the road. So if you take those books off the shelves and weren't able to listen to that music, maybe your child could do some of those things, because they really wouldn't know the side effects and bad things that could come out of those things. Some of the top music and books have offensive materials in them, and why would you not let your kid read them because of a couple choice words in them? I know some of this material could be bad for people, but sometimes it can teach you a huge lesson in your life.  If there are books you don't want yourself to read, then don't read them. I think it would be unfair to take everything that has some bad language or maybe some racism away from us just because you don't think it's good for your child to read. It's not fair to people who enjoy those books to not have the luxury to read those books anymore cause a few parents got mad about a book. Some of the old books have a lot of racism in them, and you actually read some of them in school for a class; those books also have bad language in them too. Taking those books away from us would take away our education, and we won't be able to learn from those books like we should. So, I think that censorship in libraries is just a horrible idea, because it can take away from lessons we could learn and our education that we need to be successful in life, limiting our access to diverse perspectives and potentially valuable knowledge.
251	3228	2	3	Censorship in libraries is very controversial. Many people believe that it is the right thing to do while many others strongly disagree with it. Censorship should not occur in libraries for several reasons. All people have freedom of speech in the United States and when books are taken off the shelf because they are thought to be offensive you are taking away that right. Authors have the right to express themselves and the right to have their works equally acknowledged by the public. Censorship is acceptable in some circumstances but what is censored should not be decided by the government.  First of all, freedom of speech is very important to the people of the United States. If this freedom were to be taken away, it would definitely not go unnoticed. When books, music, movies, and magazines are censored, the freedom of speech that the author had is being diminished. For example, what if an athiest wrote a book saying that GOD wasn't real? Many CHRISTIANS would want to take this book off the shelves of all libraries. Just because one group of people do not like the topic, message, or theme of a book does not mean that it should be taken out of a library. A library is a place where all books have a chance to be read not a place where people get to pick and choose what they want there because of their beliefs.  Secondly, authors have the right to express their thoughts and to have their works equally acknowleged by the public. Of course there will be books that are more popular than others, but at the same time there will also be books that are neglected not because the quality of the writing but because of the topic the author chose to right about. There is no reason to have a whole community ignore an authors work just because a large group of people do not agree with what it says. In that small group of people that were not trying to get rid of that book you will find a number of people that would read the book. Just because a majority does not like the topic of the work does not mean that the minority should have the book taken away from them. The author has the right to what they wrote and should have the opportunity to have their work acknowledged.  Last of all, censorship can also be a good thing in some circumstances. It just depends in what ways censoring is used. For example, many parents do not want their children reading, listening or watching certain things. The parents of the child should be able to decide what a kid can read, listen, or watch, not a large group of people. Many parents have different standards and what some parents find acceptable for their children MAY appall others. So, there could never be a set standard for what is acceptable and not acceptable without creating a large amount of contraversy. Once that child becomes and adult they have all the rights to decide what they want to get from a library. There should be certain limits though. For example, a person must be the age of seventeen or older to rent a 'R' rated movie. This is the same age a person must be to get into a 'R' rated movie without parental supervision. Some of the age limits throughout society should be put in libraries, but other than that, the decisions should be left up to the person.  Censorship in libraries will always be changing. Sometimes it will be in effect while at other times it will not. People of the United States have the freedom of speech and taking away books from libraries is partially taking away that right. The author should have the right to have their book equally acknowledged by the public and kept on the shelves. Censorship should be decided by the person themselves and should not have it decided for them. Parents should have the say over what their children read and should not have that decision made by others, thus ensuring that individual choice and freedom of expression are upheld.
252	3229	2	3	Have you ever been looking for a book only to find it banned from all local stores? Well I haven't had the misfortune of being in that situation, but I could only imagine the sheer distress of wanting but not finding that controversial book. I personally think that a young adult should be able to read any book or news article that they wish to. The fact that a book is found offensive or off-putting to most is no reason to completely ban the book from store and library shelves alike, because if there is even one person that could educationally benefit from reading this book then they should at least have a chance to obtain that information. One of the most important things to remember while considering this topic is that no matter what the source is or what it conveys there will always be someone that feels the book is just too graphic or hits too close to home for them to stand. In other cases however, there are books that are not proper for younger children or the faint of heart, such as the book series 'The Hunger Games' in which people are thrown into an arena and forced to fight each other for their very lives. Most people who are above the age of twelve can handle almost all of the 'offensive sources' that are attainable by the public, but there are some cases that even adults cannot handle such as the famous book that Hitler wrote in incarceration called 'Mein Kampf.' Even in those extreme cases most adults can then read. Now that my argument has been said and you know my point of view is that it varies from person to person whether they can handle a book I ask you if feel the same way that I do. My main reason for this conclusion is that if someone thinks a book is too offensive they should simply avoid this book. We do live in America the land of the free, I think we can handle a little controversy over a book or magazine. I do hope that in the future we as a nation can overcome these small setbacks that are caused by an over reaction to something offensive. I believe that we will see a day that no book will be banned from the shelves, so that our children may gain the knowledge that is contained by those fragile pages of paper.
253	3230	2	3	I think that all books, movies, and other media should not be censored because people have a right to know what they want to know or see. They need to learn from books so people can learn from history, ensuring war doesn't happen again. Libraries are for freedom to read, allowing individuals to pursue their interests and research as they choose. In newspapers and magazines, people want to know what happens in the world or to other people, whether it's good or bad, because knowing how things happen helps them understand how to prevent similar situations from affecting them. Some people might think that others shouldn't read or watch certain things, but who are they to dictate what others do, they can make their own decisions.
254	3231	2	3	"I can think of several books that, I would not want a child of mine to pick up and read. I as soon as I seen what I was going to be writing about this one flashed in my head like lighting. The book that SHE choosing is called ""SHE WALKS ALONE."" The book ""SHE WALKS ALONE"" is about a young girl that grew up without a father. Her mother never wanted to talk about him because, she knew that this way only going to make matters worse. The young girl grew up with the dream of being daddy's little girl.That's all she wanted out of life. She sit and thought is that just a little to much to ask for. After a few years, had passed by she had finally got the nerve to go on a hunt for father. She went by herself, leaving her mother behind.Her mother always pumped in the head that her father was up to no good. That she would be better off without him there. But, she went on the hunt of her father by faith in the lord. After saying many prayers to the lord, she finally thought that.She just SEPTEMBER knew what this hunt was going to take. So she went to her GRANDMOTHER, hoping that she SEPTEMBER just have the anwsers. That she needed to solve her heartace and pain. That she could just walk ALONE knowing that somewhere out there in the world that her father would be waiting for her. It's was just before the sun was beginning to sit, when she noticed a little old southern bell. Sitting out on the front porch in a wooden rocking chair. She went up to her GRANDMOTHER and kissed her on the forehead,with tears filled in her eyes.Her GRANDMOTHER said 'now dear why must you be crying.' SHE, with the lump in the throat she asked 'do you know where I SEPTEMBER find my father?' GRANDMOTHER answered with yes! Dear, SHE's laying down in his bed. That's when her face began to glow. She went in the old cottage to find her father lying on the bed writing her. She was nervous but with the help of her GRANDMOTHER she sit and talked with her father.Her father told her that her had wrote her a letter everyday.That's 365 letters a year. She told her father that I've never recieved a letter from you in my entire life span. That's when it clicked to her that SEPTEMBER be why her mother never let her check the mail. After 2 years had passed by she finally found her father. Truth was that her father WALKS out of his daughters life because, the mother didn't want him to be a part of her life. She did whatever it took to keep them apart, even if that meant going aganist law orders. Father explained that her mother needed her there to look after her because, her was into some heavy drugs at the time. Back then there was nothing SHE could do to take his daughter ALONE from her mother. The reason I choose this book was because, when I was young my father did the same to me. SHE left me and I've never had the chance to get to know my family. The pain of growing up without either mom nor dad is tuff. You cry many tears and try to patch up the holes in you heart. Sometime's the bleed still seemeds to find it's way through. After reading the book I always wondered why they called her she. They called her she because, she took the blame for her father walking out of her life. Many children are growing up without mom or dad. There's a higher percentange of single parent family's now days than before.Just like in the book most kids take the blame for a parnet not being there. If I could take that book off the shelf, then I would because, no child needs to be reminded of the pain they went through.Would you do the same if you were looking out for your child? All these children want is to know there loved and that someone cares about them.If your going to have these types of books then there needs to be a form for the parnets to fill out giving permission; if they are over age, then that's totally fine, as they're at the age where they should be able to handle it, rather than going through these feelings alone."
255	3232	2	3	I do believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, can be offensive if they are not age-appropriate. If a book is not intended for a specific age group, then it shouldn't be accessed by that group. Some libraries contain books that are highly inappropriate for children, which is why they have separate sections for adults and children. Libraries should perhaps consider having book monitors to guide readers and properly categorize materials. The library is a place with all types of books, so individuals should choose books from their designated section. When I first went to the library, I didn't know what book to check out, so the librarian showed me my section based on my age group. After that, I only checked out books that were appropriate for my age, and while magazines weren't my focus, I was happy to have a whole book. In conclusion, whenever you need a good book, check out your section, make sure the book is appropriate for you, and feed your mind with knowledge that is suitable for your level.
256	3233	2	3	Censorship In a library there are a plethora of books to choose from. Books ranging from children's to difficult adult ones. It's nice to know that you have many options and freedom to pick whatever book you would like to read. Censorship is the censoring of a piece of material so it is not legally or publically available. If a book was censored because of the contents inside it would bring into question other books or media related to it.  I believe that if books, magazines, movies, etc. were censored in a library the material wouldn't have a chance to be exposed to people. Some people write books and songs to express themselves or make money. If a book is taken out of a library other libraries will have to remove it also, and other libraries won't buy it. People create content for different reasons. Some people just wish to get there thoughts out and share their message with other people. Censorship in a way stops the flow of what people learn.  Another part about censorship is where to draw the line on what is offensive enough to be censored. If a book is removed from the library for its contents, people will look into as to why it was removed. It gets people thinking as to what other books are also offensive. The reason why one book is removed could relate to another book and could get that one to be removed also. Since censorship is probably mostly opinion, there is no clear boundary as to what can sit on the shelf and what can't.  With censorship you are only stripping the freedom of press away from people. If a publishing company accepts a piece of media only to have is censored later on, this might mean we need new publishers, or that they are also interested in getting what people have to say out into the world. The boundary for censorship is very opinionated and should not be dictated by a single group. When one book is taken down it only brings other ones into question, and for these reasons, censorship in libraries can lead to a slippery slope with no clear end. Those are my beliefs about censorship in the library
257	3234	2	3	A library is a place to go when in need of solitude and peace with researching or reading. There is no reason other than someone's opinion to why certain materials should be removed from libraries. We the people have a right to read what others have composed through their thoughts and ideas. Certain material can be offensive to different people, but to the others that could use that material for research or for pleasure reading, it would not be fair to remove it. If certain materials were removed because of someone's reaction to their personal or religious opinion, then those materials would not be available for those that would need to possess that information. The impact on the broader community must be considered.  Did anyone think when they asked for the certain offensive material to be removed? If people did, they would realize that someone had to put an enormous amount of effort to get that information out to the world. How do you think that author would feel? You just had their best work pulled from the shelves because you think it is offensive. How would you feel if someone took your best piece of writing and complained that libraries cannot put this on their shelves because it's offensive? The author's perspective deserves consideration.  There have been certain materials I have listened to or read that I thought could be offensive to certain people, but that is the media that writes the society as we read it. Some of those people have certain religions that say they can't read or listen to certain things, maybe not even watch certain materials, but others, that might be their part of livelihood. The diversity of viewpoints must be respected.  We can't just take materials off the shelves of libraries. That material is the lifeblood of our society. If you cut the blood flow, bad things are bound to happen after that. For whoever reads this, remember what we produce as media is who we are, what we do, and what we live for. Therefore, maintaining a diverse collection within libraries is essential for preserving our cultural and intellectual heritage, ensuring that a wide range of voices and perspectives remain accessible to all.
258	3235	2	3	Why Censorship bad? In our everyday lives, we come across many things that can be taken to offense. Some of these things we might not even realize, but they're out there. Everybody doesn't want there children getting into the wrong things early on, but we know it will eventually happen. We just have to teach our kids what is good and what is bad. This goes for literary items too. We need to have faith in our kids that they will do what is right. I think that when old enough, they should be able to read books and listen to music that might be offensive. I think we shouldn't get rid of all the offensive material at the libraries.  Now days, there is a lot of hard work that goes into music, movies, and books. If we start getting rid of all the offensive material, many people will be offended that in itself. The people that worked on the movie or wrote that book put a lot of time and effort into the piece. They spent countless of hours working with others just to get the piece into publication, or trying to get somone to film their movie idea. I think that it would be wrong to outrule peices of great literature because behind every one of them, there is a person that put a lot of effort into that material.  In every book you pick up today, you could look through it and find a offensive language or offensive gestures in it. The Da Vinci Code is a very detailed book and has many great facts in it, but many people find it offensive because it says Jesus had a wife and had children. This book isn't telling you what to believe or what actually happened, it is just a story full of conspiracy theories. You can still believe what you want and read this book. A movie that could be considered offensive just by the title is White Men Can't Jump. Many people hear this title and might not want to watch it, thinking that it will discriminant against white people, but instead it is a very good movie about a group of people that play basketball. Many things have offensive language but that doesn't mean we can't act like adults, read these books, and realize that they are just stories. They are not telling you what to believe and what not to believe.  In our country today, we have many different ethnic groups, and many people think differently about things. In our society we are given the right to have our own opinion about things, and we are able to like what ever we want. Even though literary might be offensive, some people like reading books like this. If I look in the library, I could find a book with offensive material, but the book could still be a very good book. Even though it is disrcimanting against me, I could still love the book. There is always controversy in our society, and almost everyone loves it. Why get rid of these books when people are still enjoying them everyday.  Like Katherine Paterson said, if she has the right to take a book off of the shelf, then so does everyone else. If we let everybody take books off the shelves, then there will be none left. We cannot control everything that people do. Taking offensive books out of the library will not stop people from reading them, but this will decline the library usage, and people will slowly stop reading. If they don't like the books at the library, then they won't have problem with not reading at all. I think that censorship in our libraries would be a bad idea, and I think we should definitely not take out all the offensive material in the libraries, as limiting access ultimately hinders intellectual exploration and the freedom to form individual perspectives.
259	3236	2	3	Books, books, and more books. There are so many of these spine bound papers, filled with everything from basic knowledge about life, all the way to stories that capture the minds of faithful readers and take them to far off distant worlds. If we were to take all the books in the world and line them up in a perfect row, we would be able to create a bridge of knowledge and iformation far enough to stretch around the moon twice and back. The problem is, that with all of this knowledge and knowledge, there are young minds that are not yet ready to soak it all up. There is no such thing as bad knowledge. There is only people who are not yet ready for the knowledge they are about to obtain. So should these materials that open up doors to new minds sets, and feelings such as books, music, magazines, and movies be censored? That answer is yes. First off, there is a certain degree of modesty and curiousity that needs to be kept in children. Children need to have a hunger for knowledge to become great learners, and intellegent minds. If the knowledge given to them does not come in the chronological order of importance in which it needs to, this will poison there minds and twist them in to something they were not yet ready to become. Secondly, knowledge presented to kids to early can harm them physicaly. Children are born with the instict to repete what they observe. This is a primal instict that humans will forever have, and is essential for living life. So take movies for example. If a child watches movies that involve sexual themes, and actions, this can be very harmful to them physicaly. If a child experiences these things to soon, they will want to simply repete what they saw. Then what is next? The answer to that question is easy. There will be more teen mothers than there are needed. Lastly, premature knowledge can harm mentaly. Take music for example. Music is an even larger gateway to mental damage then movies are. This is simply a result of bad censorship. Many think that music is not as bad as movies because you can not see anything visually, but they are wrong. Music is even worse because children can picture what ever they want to based on what is being said in the lyrics. There needs to be tougher ristrictions on music. Restrictions such as age for purchase should be raised, That is about the only way that explicit content can be blocked. In conclusion, there should be better censorship restrictions on certain materials. But I do not beleive that the materials that might be harmful or offensive should be remove as whole, simply because adults do have the right to view these materials. Libraries around the world need to better there restrictions, even laws to stop poisoning the minds of our young. We people as a whole need to come together to make this happen, because after all, the children are the future of our world.
260	3237	2	3	No I do not believe that certain materials should be removed. I believe that people should be able to have freedom of speech, and I also believe that if somebody has something on their mind they should be able to say it. I always tell people to mean what you say and say what you mean. Now, if it's younger kids getting ahold of magazines and movies with inappropriate material in it, then yes, it should be censored, or they shouldn't be placed in places where younger kids can get to them. This acknowledges the importance of protecting children while still upholding the principles of free expression for adults.
261	3238	2	3	I honestly don't think anything offensive should be removed from libraries; children don't really know what those offensive things mean. The library is the only good place to find information or to find a book that they enjoy. If you take things that @MONTH1 seem offensive to people, people are going to have a hard time finding any facts or anything they need. People use offensive things all the time, but not everyone means to insult anyone in any way. The library doesn't intentionally insult people. The library just gives us facts about what we need to know about a person or anything like that. Some people don't know how to be mature when it comes to things like that, and if they can't be mature about stuff like that, then they don't need to be in the library. I would understand if the intentions were to insult someone, but they're not, so why should the magazines, movies, books, and music be taken out of the library? That's just not fair to others when they are trying to get some information. Slavery is an offensive thing to colored people because colored people get called names that I will not say in this essay. Most people have matured over the years about what happened in the past, and it is important to remember and learn from history. Honestly, I think people will be okay; they don't need to get all bent out of shape because they see something offensive; they just need to know that it wasn't intentionally done, and it's important to view these materials within their historical context to better understand the past. Ultimately, keeping these materials in the library promotes learning and maturity.
262	3239	2	3	I strongly believe that books with offensive things should be pulled out of the library. It's not okay to say one thing and then have your child find something in the library that contradicts it. For example, if you're teaching your kids about the dangers of smoking, you wouldn't want them to think it's okay just because characters in a book are smoking. That's just wrong. They shouldn't allow those kinds of books, music, movies, or magazines in the library.  In high school, our parents told us not to smoke, do drugs, or anything like that. Sometimes it's hard to believe how harmful those things are and how they can lead to a troubled life. Movies today sometimes portray drug use as cool and fun, even showing characters having fun driving stolen cars. It's wrong to portray those things that way because it can make teens think it's okay to do them and that nothing bad will happen. The media often does a bad job of showing teens that these things are wrong. The library sets a bad example by allowing those kinds of books to sit on the shelves, implying that it's okay for people to read them and not take offense.  I was reading a book that seemed to condone racist behavior, including saying mean things and calling people bad names. I found that really offensive because I wouldn't want someone calling me names or saying bad things about me because they think it's okay. If books say all those things and readers actually believe them, we could have a problem. Some people will take offense and cause a big issue, while others might think it's okay, causing even bigger issues between people with different viewpoints.  Some people think it's okay for those kinds of books to be in the library, while others find it wrong and offensive. My personal view is that it's wrong to have those kinds of books at the library. We tell people how wrong it is to do bad things and how we hate certain offensive things, but then a book might say it's alright for those things to happen or to use foul language. I just think it's wrong to say those kinds of things in movies, music, books, or magazines, let alone have them in the library. Ultimately, allowing such material contradicts the values we try to instill and can lead to harmful consequences, so libraries should prioritize removing offensive content.
263	3240	2	3	What I think about all of this is that, to me, I really don't care because that's just who I am. It's up to the parents if they want to remove books off the shelves if they believe a certain material, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed. Also, I don't think a book will ever really hurt anyone. I mean, it's just a book; it doesn't really matter.  Next, I am saying this because I don't really get offended by stuff like this argument. And also, if there is some stuff that kids shouldn't know about, then they should put those things in the adult section and not in a place where kids can easily find them. They shouldn't put stuff that you think children should never know about in the kids' section.  As a matter of fact, I don't know why they should remove stuff like movies. Because if they are trying to block them from kids, they are really dumb to do that. Because there are movies that children can watch, and some parents are not going to let their children watch a PG-13 movie, or other movies they don't want them to see at their ages, unless their parents allow it. And that goes the same with the music. I don't know if they have bad music in the library. I don't see rap stuff in the library, like raps with cussing and other stuff like it. So, this is my thought about these arguments, and ultimately, I believe parents should have the right to guide their children's choices.
264	3241	2	3	Yes, I think they should take offense books off the shelf because little kids read the books, then they will probably be taught wrong from right. And if the books had violence, then they will think that is right to do. Therefore, removing potentially harmful books could help protect children's developing sense of morality.
265	3242	2	3	Censorship is a big controversy in modern society due to the fact of so many opinions being conveyed through all the new medias in the modern world. When a person has a view they tend to want to share it with the world or defend it against those who oppose their opinion. Some people do not always like what is being said or take offense in the way it is presented, thus causing the government, or any authority, to remove or replace these words, photos, lyrics, or film from a select public, such as children, or the entire public. This is censorship and it has caused many debates over what is acceptable in society's media. I believe censorship is wrong. It violates the **people's** rights of free speech. When a person has an opinion, they have the right to voice it anyway they want. The authorities should not be involved in what someone writes, sings, creates, etc., in anyway. Censorship takes away from the integrity and purity of a human's thoughts. Who is to say what can and can't be said? Do we just let the government tell us what we can say and what is illegal? Do we stop expressing ourselves in the way we desire because it is not appropriate? No. We, as the people, must be free to say what we want in our stories and songs, along with movies and other media. If a person does not like what they see then they can turn away or they have the right to speak out against it in their own way; but they do not have the right to oppress. They should write back, convey their message and try to win support, not control. Censorship is not good for any society. People want to say whatever they want and they have the right to. Censorship is not a solution to discrimination or anger, it is only a fuel. If parents do not like something and do not want their children to experience it then do not take it from them, then they should tell them how it is 'wrong' and give them their opinion and reasons so the child **can** decide what they believe in on their own. An opinion is every human being's right and it belongs to them, not the authorities; therefore, censorship is harmful and should be avoided in a free and open society.
266	3243	2	3	Have you ever walked into the library hoping to find a good book, and picked up a very vulgar and inappropriate article? Were you disappointed to see what children could easily get a hold of, or did you just place it back onto the shelf just simply thinking it wasn't your style of book? In this essay I would like to discuss both views on these censored books, and why I believe they should be censored.  People all over the world are vastly different. From color, race, size, shape, and personality there is not a single person on the planet who is exactly like the other, so why would they all have the same interest in reading or music? Some people may enjoy a romantic novel that makes your heart skip beats while others may prefer the thrill of a horror story. Either way everyone has their own opinion of what makes a great book. The same thing occurs in the question, whether or not censored items should be allowed into a public library.  Many people say yes, people have their right to choose what they will or will not observe or listen to, 'If you don't like the style in which the item is portrayed then don't pick it up.' But others say no, 'The library is suppose to be a safe haven where they don't have to worry about children seeing and hearing things they shouldn't.' In my personal opinion I believe the parent figure is right, although I also can understand the opposing opinion.  As to the opposing opinion, I can understand why you might think that censored items are ok in libraries. If it is a personal choice of how the author writes the book and still makes a great story, I believe that the book is alright as long as it is not in reach of a child. Many people have different ideas on what censored means and there could be the consequence of loosing many books but there are always consequence to every choice, good or bad.  In my personal experience, I have taken my ten year old sister to the library to borrow a movie and a few books. She is very scholarly and comprehends things quickly. Furthermore when she found a book that she thought would be interesting. The book turned out to be full of curse words and profanity. Think about it, what would you say to your child who just learned a few curse words from a place you expected to be a safe environment? To me it is ridiculous to have to search every single book, cd, movie or magazine for profanity to make sure it is safe for my sister to read! Kids these days have changed majorly in their attitudes, language, and responses to things and I believe a big part of why is because of what they take in through the worldly materials. If the books and the music they read and listen to are offensive and rude then what else would they know other than to follow the lines of something more 'cool' than them. Therefore I believe that there should not be censored books in a library, and parents should have the right to ask for them to be removed.  When I sit back and realize what I would want my kids to be reading and listening to I wonder why people would even chance the fact that their child could be negatively influenced by it. Why tempt them to be someone that reflects profanity and offensiveness when they could be so much more? Parents should do everything they can to make their kids the best person they can be and I believe that they have a right to protect their children from not reaching their full potential. Therefore in the end books should be censored, ensuring libraries remain safe and enriching places for all children.
267	3244	2	3	Some books are not suitable for kids. They could make a section for adults that includes books that are not censored. These books should not be allowed to be checked out by kids under the age of @NUM1 unless their parent or guardian allows them to. Some adults don't care what their kids read, but the library should have some guidelines in place. I've read books at school that were adult books at school. Back in elementary school, I remember checking out a lot of books, but I don't think they were adult books. Some kids enjoy reading adult books; it helps their reading skills, but the content in the book is not suitable for them. Creating an adult section could also offer a wider variety of literature for adults to choose from without concern for censorship to protect children. Making a section for adults would help stop kids from reading adult material, while still allowing access with parental consent. I believe that this should take place at every library around the world, as it would better protect children while respecting the reading choices of adults.
268	3245	2	3	I think as long as the book ain't offensive or bad then people should keep reading it. If it's offensive I think they shouldn't read it at all cause it would not be right to read such a thing. Also I think if there is bad music it should be taken off the shelves because it's important to protect others from harmful content. Parents or teachers wouldn't want their kids finding out bad words to say, so removing that music helps create a better environment. It is important to consider the impact of what we consume and promote.
269	3246	2	3	I do indeed believe that certain material should not be in public libraries, or places where young people can see it. Things, such as pornographic material, should not be out in the open where kids can see it. I think we would all believe the same way when we say that kids do not need to be seeing these things. I personally have been in a movie rental shop and seen some of the movies that my parents would not want me to see. Material such as this should be put away somewhere out of sight and requested if wanted. I also have a religious view on all of this. I know that it is a sin to look at things such as porn, and so the people in charge of the shop or library ought to respect me and my religion. @PERSON1 in the @CAPS1 says that if eating meat causes his brother to stumble, then he will not do so. We need to have the same aspect in life. If something causes someone else harm, we should not do it. This is an issue that we face every day, and the reason I am using pornographic material is because it is everywhere. If I am standing in the @ORGANIZATION1 check out line, I see the people magazines, and I find it very offensive! I will say, though, if you are old enough to live by yourself, then you can look at whatever you want. I just find it intolerable to post these materials where viewers who do not want to see them have to see them, and that is why these materials should be restricted.
270	3247	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials in the library should be removed off the shelf if found offensive. Some of my reasoning is very logical and if you were a reader I'm sure you want to read something thats true and very interesting. Libraries all consist of books from everything you can think of. Libraries are really for learning and not to offense anybody in any manner.  The reason why I believe they should not be removed because everybody is equal and not everybody likes to read the same books. There should be offensive books because I think that theres just to many kids that would not like to grab a book and it be orginal and not offensive about them in some way. Books are created to read and have interest, laughter, enjoying. From some of the students at my school I spoke with said that when they are really having a bad day they turn on their music and it helps them because it makes them feel alot better and the day gets easier for them. They say they dont have to be depressed or thinking about something that made them mad that day.  Well as in from my experience with books I can tell you somethings and sometimes that when I was feeling down how I grabed a book. The first time I realized books are really helpful and I'm also talkling about magazines, music and movies. Well to be honest I'm not a big reader. I enjoy listening to music because sometimes songs can relate to you and make you fell that your not alone. Also it helps you learn how to cope with some things that you could of never coped with before because it makes you feel relaxed. Just how some of my friends said that they feel relaxed when they read a book.  So my point is that you know and I know that their are music out there that is very offensive and some books that are. Does it drive us crazy that they do? No it does not because it actually helps us. It helps us by showing us away out from our daily streesful lifes and sometimes you learn in books and songs of how other people deal with their stress. So you learn alot of things than feel offensive about books or music. As you can tell I'm a huge music fan and there has been lots of songs that were offensive but it did not bug me much.  I hope I gave you some kind of shock that music and books should'nt be removed if offensive. It's just music is amazing as well for books we all need our space sometimes and those two things are just there for us which is either to help us learn or feel relaxed and calm. Thank you for reading this and I hope I persuaded you enough with my reasoning. Remember music and books are alot alot of fun and if you never gave it a chance, you should try it sometime. Therefore, removing offensive materials limits personal growth and the exploration of diverse perspectives.
271	3248	2	3	No, I don't think books are offensive in libraries. Movies are a different kind of story; if your child is under the age of eighteen they should not be renting a rated R movie, unless their parent approves of it. This is one reason why our public library should not have rated R movies. While I was in our public library one afternoon I was looking at the movie selection, I was trying to decide which movie to choose. There was a little boy, at the age of nine or ten it looked like to me, but he had two movies in his hand. They looked really good it was an action type movie, so I asked the boy if I could see the movie really fast. He said yes, so I grabbed it from him and looked at the rating because from the title picture it looked gory. I noticed it was a rated R movie, and I told the boy did you know this is a rated R movie and he said yes. I was surprised his parents would let him watch movies like that; if I was his age I would never have been able to.  My second reason why our public library should get rid of any kind of swimsuit magazines like Sports Illustrated and/or Maxim magazines is because of their inappropriate content. I was looking at the magazine rack one day and noticed magazines like Sports Illustrated swimsuit magazines and many more. Do you think your children should not have seen any kind of magazines like that in our library for the public to see? If a little girl went to the magazine rack and saw that magazine, she would either want to look at it or act like she not even noticed it. At her age she wants someone to look up to and if she sees a model on or in the magazine she would want to possibly look like her, so this is how eating disorders start. This is the reason why libraries should get rid of any kind of magazines under that category.  These are the reasons why I think our local library should get rid of rated R movies and/or Magazines like Sports Illustrated and Maxim. If you agree with me contact your library and tell them what I have told you today. This July we put a stop to censorship in our libraries and promote a more appropriate environment for children.
272	3249	2	3	There is a type of boundary that libraries restrict readers from gathering knowledge about certain things in books. This is called censorship. However what you may not have known is that it is thought about in every school and every public library. What would you do if you saw your child reading a book that contained frightening descriptions that are to horrrific or to adult like for their own good? This is the question that plauges them every year with new shipments of books. Although yes that seems terrifying it is not right to take books off the shelf for a few reasons; The congressional law allowing us to have freedom of press, freedom of thought, and the fact children must take in all the knowledge they can to be the best they can achieve. First of the arguements that can be held is the freedom of press. This law was enacted in the year of 1788 and is still in effect today. If an individual wanted to write a book that was not for children then he or she can do so without penalizations. Children can read it yes, but that shouldn't be blamed on the author. If so then that person would never get any royalties for their story and no money to support themselves. It's hard to get upset with your children for learning something wrong, but it's not right to blame the writer. When it comes to the aruguments of what to do on censorship the freedom of thought pops into most minds. This is another law that says citizens are allowed to think what they will of anything. Just as the freedom of press an indiviudal can pick up that book for adults and read it. No matter the age they are. If they are discouraged by it then by all means let them put it down, however, if they enjoy the read and the more unique wording than in childrens novels let them continue learning. A child can absorb many things and recall them at times where adults sometimes cannot remember. This is not scientificly proven but when you are around children constantly you notice this. Just as a babies mind is a sponge it still continues to gather all of the information it possibly can during its pre-teen years. When they are allowed to read any book and not sit infront of a television screen all day they learn more. Now someone can come along and say: 'What if the book is a fantasy?'. It's no different. The storyline is not what teaches them, it is the words and how they are used that is knowledge. An educated man can sometimes get tounge-tied with words where as if someone who did not do well in school or college read quite a bit they are able to use words with great ease. It is not allways the case, but wouldn't you like your own child to sound intelligent while speaking during important events? All in all it seems to be a great waste when censoring books for the public. There can be great things in those books that not everybody can reap. Pulling them off the shelf could mean that you impede someones ability to learn a new word or gramatical law. If one parent could pull a book off a shelf then another could do it and soon you would not have any books. It would be a scary day if that happened. For it would not be something that went well in our history. Since humankind has had writing we became more intelligent, taking books off all of the shelves would revert us to primitive beings. So keep the books on the shelves even if children should not read them, not just because they can learn far greater with a book as a resource, but that the two congressional laws say it should be permitted, so we should value the freedom of learning and expression that books offer.
273	3250	2	3	Some books in libraries offended some people. But other people want to read this book. No one person has the right to say that because a book offended them, the libraries should remove it. If some book offends some person, that doesn't mean all people will be offended by this book. My opinion is they should not remove this book, because some people like to read that book, and it's their choice. If someone doesn't like this book and this book offends them, they should not read this book and read what they like, but don't say it should be removed. I think everyone likes different books, reflecting diverse interests and perspectives. So, libraries should keep everything that people like to read, supporting intellectual freedom and access to a variety of viewpoints for everyone.
274	3251	2	3	If everyone in the world could permanently take a book, movie, music, etc., off the shelf because they think it is offensive, would there be any of those things left for us to enjoy? I personally think that if people could do that, they would, but is everything someone else finds offensive really offensive to you? No, it might not be, so does that give that person the right to pull it off the shelf permanently so no one else can read it? I think no one has the right to pull that item off the shelf because of their own opinion of it. If anyone could do that, would there ever be uniqueness in people? I don't think there would be. Just because you think the music a person listens to is offensive does not mean they think the same. Thus it shouldn't be taken away from that person if he/she enjoys listening to it. On the other hand, I understand that some people might listen to music or read books that have offensive language and that they would not want their children hearing or reading that, but that does not mean the music or book should be pulled from the shelf. Ask yourself if you would react the same way to a person who uses offensive language; you can't just take that person out of the world. So I guess the point I'm trying to get across is that just because you think it's offensive and don't like it doesn't mean everyone in the world thinks that. To end my article, I want you to think about what's offensive to you may not be the same for others, and that imposing your subjective views on others limits diversity and free expression.
275	3252	2	3	The contents of the books in libraries vary in many ways. Some are children's books, some are adult books, and some are in between. Libraries have books that spark interest in a reader. Not all books are made for a particular age group or gender. Which that should not mean that a library should be picked apart because of the contents of the novel,magazines,music,or movies. A library is suppose to be for anyone that enjoys to read a variety of materials, not just a select few because some people don't like the text or the meanings behind that book , song, or movie. In the library, in our little town, splits up the variations of the reading materials,music,and movies. There is a children's section, that has all the books we all grew up with, in half the building. Also an audult section for larger novels topics that teens and younger children would have no interest in or their parents would want them reading. Another great thing is that they have books for people in between, like myself, with teen books that spark our interest. With the ideas that people are writing about today we can not possible control what comes to their mind. Some of the greatest books that are out are probably have the deepest meanings that some audiences don't prefere to listen to. But that is what is so great is that people have the liberty to go and find a book, or a magazine, or even a movie that they like.When freedom of what you read is taken away reader will stop reading. Doesn't the admisistrations of schools want kids to read to get their test scores up? If you take away what they like to read doesn't that mean they will stop reading? Also doesn't that mean the test scores will go down? In my experience of topics that I have read about have been more grown up than my mother would like,but the fact of it is, is that people will read what they want. People don't like to be told no in my personal experience. Taking away topics that are well liked even with words or contents of what they are reading is not fair to the readers. I believe that they should not censor books, music, movies, magazines, etc. because that would mean the libraries would be gone. It is essential to maintain the diverse collection that libraries offer, ensuring everyone can find something to engage with and learn from, and to prevent the erosion of intellectual freedom that censorship would bring.
276	3253	2	3	If something offensive is found at the library, should it be taken off of the shelves? Some people might look at this question and instantly say yes. Others might not think anything of the item and move along. I disagree with those who believe the item should be remove. Instead, I believe the item should not be removed and stay on the shelves. As a child, I have always gone to the child's section of the library to find a book. I steared clear of the 'grown-up' area. So if my mother found an offensive item on the shelves she would make sure I didn't see it. I believe if the parent watches what their child sees then they wouldn't worry about them seeing something offensive. However, let's say that an adult sees this item and feels it should be removed. She/he has the right to remove that item but what if, to someone else, that item was exactly what they were looking for? The world we live in has many offensive things in it that we see everyday, such as newspapers, television programs, billboards, etc., and if someone were to come along and take it all away, we would have nothing left but that one persons interests. This is why we have a little bit of everything in our libraries. If there is an offensive book or a bad movie and someone doesn't like it and feels the need to remove it, that is selfish but then they aren't thinking of what other people might like. I have always heard the saying, 'If everybody liked the same thing, it would be a boring world.' I find this to be completely true. If everybody liked the same thing, then let anybody that enters the library remove an offensive item. However, if this happens, authors won't want to keep writing books and singers won't want their songs there if they find out someone keeps removing their work. On the same note, people won't want to go to the library if they know they won't find what they want because someone took it down. I disagree with the ones who feel the item should be removed because to someone that book might be perfect. I believe that the book or magazine or movie should stay on the shelf for someone who has the intent to read it. If a person walks by and feels the book is offensive, they need realize that to someone else it might not be and walk away. I am sure people would find my choice of books offensive or bad and would like to remove them from shelves. However, I would stop going to the library if that happened, and that would be a great loss to me. This is why I feel books should stay where they are.
277	3254	2	3	Censorship, or the removing of material deemed inappropriate or offensive, has been used as a means of controlling people's thoughts and feelings for many centuries. The **British Empire** used it in the **American** colonies during the **American Revolutionary** **War** to keep the colonists loyal to the crown. The **Nazis** used censorship not just during the **Second World** **War** **era** as a brand of propaganda, but also during **World** **War** **II** **occupation** under **Hitler's** guidance. Censorship is still in use in the **United States** today, as a way to 'protect the children'. The **Federal Communications Commission** tells the **American** public what we can and cannot watch on television and what we can and cannot listen to on the radio. Other organizations tell us what books we can and cannot read, what video games we can and cannot play, and what items we can and cannot buy. Such organizations, I believe, are pushing the **United States** **United States** and other freedom-loving nations to the edge of totalitarianism. As Katherine Paterson stated, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' If one person has the right to control what we buy, what we listen to, and what we see, then how come we don't have that right to control the same things for them? Where do we draw the line? Eventually, all books, movies, magazines, music, and video games would be deemed offensive and inappropriate. Culture would slowly wither and die, and our lives would become drab and essentially useless, for lack of a better term. I recently read a book titled '**Homegoing**', by **Yaa Gyasi**, about two periods in a boy's life: his childhood with his family in tribal **Ghana**, and the life he had after his mother's death in the **Asante** capital of **Kumasi**. **Yaa Gyasi**'s work includes some passages that are less than angelic, and, had strict censorship been in place, these passages would have caused the book to go unpublished. **Gyasi**'s work gave not only myself but a multitude of others insight into the life that **Africans** face in the changing landscape of their **world**, and it certainly made me realize once again that I have a life rich in family, friends, and comfort. All in all, censorship is a horrid disease that slowly infects and consumes every part of our lives. If you get to censor something you find offensive, then why don't I do the same thing? Some censorship is good, and a fact of life. But we have to ask ourselves, where do we draw the line? Where's the boundary between safety and outright police state? Censorship is just a fancy term for blatant disregard of the **Constitution**, as freedom of speech is guaranteed for all **American** citizens. As a famous colonial revolutionary once said, '**Give** me liberty, or **give** me death!' If censorship continues to grow and our libraries grow emptier and emptier, then I shall take death over liberty, for liberty with censorship is no liberty at all.
278	3255	2	3	If any book, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be offensive to anybody don't even bother to look at the material. Even if you might find it interesting, in the end, you find out that it is offensive to you, then just take it the other direction. No material of books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the materials because authors, directors, and music writers have made it their creation. Nobody has the same views as everybody else; each person is different in their own way. Then why is it so bad when they have offended you if it wasn't intentional? Each individual has their own opinion of each material. It might be offensive to somebody else, but to another person, it might not even affect their views about what they've read, seen, or heard. Others have to realize that even if it's written down it is not directed towards the person reading it, if they have taken it the wrong way. Even if you're just making an observation just walk away and do not let it get the best of you. Don't let anybody tell you different about your own opinion. The censorship in libraries is not made just for you, they are made for everybody around you. If you do not like a book in the library or even think it is inappropriate then just walk away and put it down. Anything in the library shouldn't be removed, just because you didn't like it doesn't mean that somebody else will find it interesting. If you find any material offensive then maybe you should think in your head of ways to make an argument to prove the authors that they are wrong. You just have to be strong and take anything that comes your way, and you have to be ready for it. I go to the library once in a while, and most of the time I'm just looking around for something to read and I find something interesting and I pick it up. Once I start reading it, and if I feel the type of material is directed towards me and I find it offensive I just leave it along and put it down. I don't take it the wrong way because I know it isn't a serious type of matter, because it didn't have my name in the book. So, why should I get worked up about it if it isn't about me? I don't take any type of material that I'm looking at in any negative way because I know that it's someone else's opinion and not my own. If anybody takes it the wrong way then they should look at other things about the topic and put your own opinion on the topic. Anybody should know that your own opinion matters more than anything else or anybody else. The littlest things shouldn't get to anybody, especially if it doesn't matter. It doesn't change how you feel about the topic. The way you feel about it should not affect the way other people see it, therefore, personal reactions shouldn't dictate what materials are available to others.
279	3256	2	3	I myself believe that censorship in libraries should not be allowed. If there was to be any censorship, it should be from the parents of a child, or if you’re not a child, then you don't need censored material. By censoring something as small as books, movies, and so on, I think it will give people a fake sense of what really happens. Just because something isn't censored doesn't mean it should be taken out of context either. Think of it like this: if you are walking down a street, it's not going to be censored; people will say bad words, show bad habits, and even go as far as seeing death or more. Being a kid who really never been censored from anything, including books, I’ve learned a lot, but I feel as if I went to a library to get a book and it's censored or taken off the shelf, then I will be shown a fake world. Once again, if life can't be censored, then we shouldn't censor anything else.  A censored book, movie, or whatever it may be could also determine how much someone could learn from it. People go to libraries to learn hard facts with proof and evidence and depending on the subject in which they're looking up.  This is some of many reasons I think censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed. Censorship should be chosen by who you are, not by other people. In the end, we may never know what’s better until we try it for ourselves and determine the value of uncensored access to information.
280	3257	2	3	No, because the writer is explaining the way the story really happened. If your kid asks you about the word, tell him/her it's not a good word to say, or you can take the book back and get him/her a new one. Say your kid comes home from school and says a curse word, and you ask him/her where they learned it. And they said the teacher said it. You can tell the teacher you don't want him/her reading that book. Cursing is a way of explaining the story better to them, I guess, but there are other ways to tell the story without offensive language.
281	3258	2	3	Library censorship: good or bad? It is a very rare occasion that I go to the library. I'm a typical guy, I like sports, video games, and hanging with my friends. When I'm not in school I try to stay away from everything that reminds me of it, like libraries. Those very rare occasions when I do go to the library, for a summer reading book for school, I usually browse around to see what they have on the shelves. Some of the stuff I see at libraries catches my eye, and not because it looks like a good book, but because it's shocking to see what they allow to be even put on the shelves.  On the book shelves that I have walked by I have seen romance novels and they aren't as bad as I would have thought, at first they catch my eye with the titles because they are usually kind of out of the ordinary. I feel that these books aren't inappropriate for young adults, but younger kids and pre-teens shouldn't be reading them. So as long as there is separation between the kids section and adult section then I think it is completely okay to have romance novels and any other graphic novels up on the shelves because they are types if literature.  Now magazines on the other hand can be taken either way. Gossip magazines can be entertaining, but they can also be highly offensive. The problem with magazines a lot of the writing is people's opinions and they could be talking in a very negative way about some people or some things. I think it's up to the library to make a decision on that but if someone complains about it I think the library should be kind enough to take it off of the shelf. They are also magazines that show off models in swimsuits and clothes, and I feel that if the guys or girls are nude at all in the magazine they should either be in a back room and have people request to see them or they shouldn't be in the library at all. I've seen parents walk into a library and their son asked them why that magazine had a half naked lady on it and I just felt like it was highly irresponsible for the library to just leave these magazines out for kids to see them and then bug there parents all day about what they saw at the library.  Music and movies are not that hard to control from them getting into the wrong hands. Nowadays CD cases for music have stickers on them that say parental advisory, so I feel that the library should be able to have any types of music on the shelves because music now has warnings on the cases. Movies are the same way, they have ratings. If the librarian see's a 10 year old kid trying to check out a rated R movie then she should be fired, because there is clearly no reason why she would do that. Excuses can't come into play here because if you look at the rating and then you look at the person you can usually see if the movie is appropriate for them or not. Now pornographic movies should not be in libraries at all; libraries are supposed to be a place to get something nice to read or listen to. Pornography in a library is like having strippers in school, it is just not ethical.  In conclusion I feel that censorship in libraries is a good thing to have. If libraries organize things well and make sure kids aren't in areas that they shouldn't be then everything should be fine, and the library can be a resource for everyone.
282	3259	2	3	I dont see any reason why to take books off the shelves. If someone doesnt like a book, then they dont have to read it. Books are ment to entertain or inform people. There are books that talk about black people in a bad manner, but they still need to be out there so that people will know. Libraries are out to make money thats all. Let them make money, they can sell whatever they want. If I had a library I would sell just about anything i could. People will watch, listen, read anything, and offering a wide variety of materials could cater to more interests. So why not sell it or rent it out? It's a honest way of making money, and I believe providing access to diverse content is beneficial, even if some find certain materials objectionable.
283	3260	2	3	'@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 I like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and I can not lie, when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waste and a round thing in your face you get sprung.' @CAPS2 song in itself depicts a rather provocative tone towards women and men. While '@CAPS3 a'las what sorrows can be seen over yonder' tells us that love can be found anywhere. Now look closly at both lymrics you will eventually see a connection in both. The rap song @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is about a man that finds love in large glutius maximi while the other says that love can be seen everywhere, and anywhere. To say that music, magazines, books, and more should be banned is to say that throwing an @CAPS6 flag on the floor is just okay. Well its not; banning books, music, etc. is just like cencoring someones imaginationa and creativity. It is just like the book @DATE1, where @CAPS4 @CAPS8 is watching, and that we are only based on what we are allowed to read, and even think. Taking away movies and books, is to not allow people to learn from their past. Take @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for example, though that movie is rather gory and morbid, it still tells us of the horrors of the time during @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @NUM1 and that the past is never something that should be let go. Always remeber the past so you can learn from it. Had that movie been cencored or removed I personally would have never learned about the hardtimes of the @CAPS13 and what it can do to a persons soul and emotions. A book, magazine, movie, etc are all gateways to new worlds, where children can use their imagination and justify what their personality is. I can say that books and songs have saved lives. The other day a friend of mine was on the edge of suicide and was almost a squeeze away from pulling the trigger when I told him that what he was doing was wrong. I was @NUM2 at the time, and i rushed through my ipod to find a song '@CAPS14 to @CAPS15 a @CAPS16' by the @CAPS17. I basically read him the lyrics and he eventually put the idea of sucicide away. While yes, there aresongs & books like The @CAPS18 and the @CAPS19 that @MONTH1 have provoked people to do crazy things, even to kill. We stilll see more good being done and shown through reading and writing because they are all ways to express ourselves. A song can @CAPS15 a @CAPS16 as much as it can take one away. Even then we can see that letting imagination flow is better than letting the imagination get cencored, because if a book is seen as something unwanted or taken away, it will cause more harm in that it would be wanted more, it would be craved becasue it is an unreachable thing.
284	3261	2	3	The world today in the United States is hardly free. Everything that we see, hear, and read is censored. Is this good or bad? For the most part, it is good. Adults, teenagers, and young children all should only be allowed access to certain types of movies, music, books, magazines, radio stations, and so on. I don't believe they should be removed, but I do believe these materials should have limited access. Some materials are kind of hard to keep from children and teenagers, but I believe what is kept from children is up to children's parents to say whether or not the children can watch, look at, or listen to what ever it may be that is concidered offensive to some people. Some materials are and should continue to be censored, but to an extent. If a person were to watch an R-rated movie or even unrated at a movie theater, that person would have to be 17 years of age or older. That is the law, and I believe this is a good thing. Parents should, also, definitely be the one's to censor what children watch, see, hear, or read. Children for the most part don't know any better. Children are curious little beings. If there is something that a parent has laying around the house that the child has never seen before that child will immediately wonder what this material is. If it were a magazine, they might look at it. I believe that there is a certain age to be allowed to look at these things, because there are a lot of materials in this world that are meant for adults only. These materials have to be kept open to the public or else all the people who don't find these materials bad would be broke because people fight for what they believe in and that costs money, especially if the people want to take their opinion as to why they should be able to see or hear whatever they want to because they are an adult and they are mature enough to participate in these activities. The people who fight for what they believe in would need a lawyer. Lawyers have to be paid or else they will not work for you. There are a lot of people around the world who know what they believe is good and bad. It's all in how these people being are raised, and were raised as a child themselves. If people believe something is bad, then they don't have to read, listen to, look at, or watch any of the things they find offensive. These activities are only for the people who do not have a problem with seeing or hearing these materials, therefore these materials should be censored, but only to a certain extent. If everything in this world that even one person found offensive were removed, then, what about all of the other people who do not find those materials offensive? What about the adults who find no harm in seeing or hearing these things? Not every person in this world has the same opinion. In conclusion, not everything should be censored. The materials children see and hear is up to parents. People will fight for their freedom to see and hear what they want because people know what they want and will get it any way they have to. This is America, let's not be overly strict about things.
285	3262	2	3	How many of you have ever heard any offensive language? Seen something that you think no other kid should see? I'm going to guess a lot. Almost every person in the world has heard, said, or seen something that they shouldn't have. Most hear curse words before they can even walk. If you can't keep kids from hearing or seeing anything offensive then why would you try and edit what they read in libraries? After all, it is a public place where anyone can go to read in peace. Almost every person in the world has said or done something wrong, but they learn from it. It allows them to mature and grow up. Children learn new words all their life and are bound to come across some that shouldn't be said. Yet, most will say it and see what happens and learn from it. If you take out things like that in the books they read, then how will they learn? The books that children read varies. The younger kids won't know what bad words are until they get older. The books that older kids read often have harsh words in them to display a serious part to the story, or a tragic moment in the character's life. Some even tell of what happens when the character says a bad word and what happens to him if he says it. Authors usually vary their vocabulary in the stories that they write. If they are writing about the 1940s, why would they try and clean up the grammar that was spoken from that time, try and change what the reader might think about that time? Leave the libraries' books on the shelves no matter what is in them. Kids always see and hear something offensive no matter how hard their parents try. Books use words to display important parts of a story and our history, so censoring them would take away from what they can teach us; therefore, books need to stay put in the libraries that they are in.
286	3263	2	3	Censorship of @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' is a quote from Author, Katherine Paterson. She is saying that there are some books that most people would think to be a little graphic or shocking, but we can not take those books off the shelf because then eventually there would be no books left to read. I agree with her in the sense that we can not take certain books off the shelves in our library. We can not take them off the shelves because that would be taboo in many ways. It would be stepping into hot water because the people would be violating the authors freedom of the press, who would decide what material was right and wrong, and how far is too far when it comes to censorship. These are just a few of the many reasons this is wrong. Taking certain books of shelves would be against our constitution. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 gives all @CAPS5 citizens the freedom of the press. This means that they can write anything that they want without having to worry about the government's or the citizens' opinions. If we start taking certain books off shelves of libraries because they @MONTH1 include a few controversial things we are violating there natural right. Which leads me to my next argument in if we do allow censorship, who should be in charge? So many people want to include their opinions on what is right and what is wrong. So, who are we supposed to believe? On person @MONTH1 think somthing is out of line, but the person standing next to them would think it is ordinary. That is what makes this country great. We are a mixture of many different ideas that work together for a common goal. If the government would assign someone to censoring books, magazines, or music, there would be a uproar. How can one person say if something is wrong? And if someone was allowed to censor things, what would be included? How far is to far? This is a hard question to ask. If we were to allow one person to judge things what should be included? Would the judgement stop at just books, movies, and music? Or would it expand to judgement of clothes and lifestyles? If we implement this system of censorship, our who lives would become one big judgement. Self expression would go out the window because people would be scared of being deemed 'inapropriate.' Our world would become a puzzle of trying to fit in and to not be noticed, rather than standing out and pushing the human race forward. There are always going to be those people who disagree with things. They find it out of place or offensive. What we have to realize is that everyone views things in different ways. We as people need to learn to accept something out of the ordinary, and try to understand where otheres are comming from. If we can do that our world would be a much better place. Thus, understanding diverse perspectives and resisting censorship are crucial for fostering a more accepting and progressive society for everyone.
287	3264	2	3	I believe that everyone has the right to choose what book should be banned from their children, but not from the public. Everyone has their own belief in what he or she reads or writes, even watches, so the library is perfect the way it is. We cannot throw out books we find offensive because of our beliefs, because somebody else might want to come along and read about a certain religion or a certain topic. If we threw out all the books and made a library with only the books we wanted, we'd be in a lot of debt because then we'd have to build libraries for everyone instead of one that allows us all to enjoy our favorite books all at the same place. So, if we have a problem with a book or movie from the library, we should just keep our children away from that item and inform them on why they should not be subjected to that item, as censorship of public resources based on personal beliefs is ultimately detrimental to a diverse and informed society.
288	3265	2	3	A very wise man in MY life once said, 'The only way to escape temptation, is to remove the temptation all together.' MY DAD, PERSON2, while growing up had poor influences all around him. HE went to a run-down school, lived in a crime torn neighborhood, had a drunk for a DAD, had no mother around to help him and had an older brother that often beat him and hurt him, emotionally and physically. As HE grew up there were temptations to do the wrong thing morally all around him. HE had no example of how to behave, yet HE stayed away from GANGS, tobacco, drugs, guns, prostitutes, violence and fighting, and even something as 'minor' as pornography. As I have been growing up with MY DAD as a hard working individual and having MY mother around to help me with school work and preparing for college, the truth shows how times have changed. Just before I was born, MY parents moved out of the old crime riden neighborhood and out of the city for that matter. We moved to the suburbs where crime is more rare and mostly just misdimeaners. MY DAD told me one day, 'I'm scared by how the times have changed. When I was a kid, fowl language was un heard of in songs and music but now-a-days the songs seem to be about nothing but sex, drugs, killing people, and even about rape! At this rate I'm scared of the thought of what you're kids are going to see, son.' HE had a valid point. In our curent days the youth can go to even the public library and get books on illegal drugs and movies with sex scenes and music that talkes about killing law enforcement officers. What has the world come to when a child of age eight THIS MONTH walk into a public library and check-out a book on cocaine? The worst part is that they can just read these books while browsing, they don't actually have to check the book out. A quote from the author Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I believe that rather than hoping they don't pull the book off the shelf that we should just remove the book from the shelf and NOT have the book there at all. Public libraries are marked as safe places for children and adults to go to if they feel thretened or endangered. Well what if MY DAD as a parent feels thretened by the fact that there are evils out in the world and they have become so accepted by todays society that they are even found in the public library? Then what? Public libraries and other public resourcess should be controled and monitored about what they allow into their doors. A parent SHOULD NOT have to hope that his or her child doesn't pick up a book about an inapropriot topic while in public but should know that that is NOT the case. Parents should be able to relax and rest asured that their child is safe from the filth of inmoral things, and that can only happen when we actively remove such temptations from readily accessible public spaces.
289	3266	2	3	When I was in seventh grade I had a mission to read every Judy Blume book I could get my hands on. Some of the material in her books proved to be a little too racy for most middle schoolers and some parents had apparently deemed it inappropriate and our school librarian had made the decision not to carry it in the school's library. I was devastated, there would be no way my mother would agree to buy me all twenty some odd books that Judy Blume had written and I didn't have enough money from my meager allowance and various lemonade stands to purchase them myself. Back then, this censorship which banned my favorite books from ever showing their covers in our school's library, bothered me immensely. I couldn't understand why some people's parents might view some of the subject matter in her books as too mature for our age group. However, I am having a change of heart. Now I can understand why our school's library might not be so fond of carrying books with racy aspects to them. That is why I believe that in school libraries, some books should be censored or marked mature. In public libraries though, these books should not be censored. Books need to be censored in school libraries because some children might be too immature to handle the subject matter within the book's pages. Most parents want their children to stay as innocent as possible for as long as possible and I can respect this idea. Having advanced books would also make the school look bad as not all parents would be on board with the idea and some would complain about their children reading something which they didn't intend them to find out about for many years to come. Not all censorship has to do with sex. Another type of graphic novel which is often censored is the violent type. The real-time war story which depicts the horrors of fighting for one's country and juxtaposes is with the thought that was is valiant and something to be applauded in the people back home. Some of these stories can get very graphic as to convey the point that war is not all fine and dandy and all it seems cracked up to be. These type of stories are important for our culture to prevent any misconceptions we might have or try to prevent them from a young age by shocking the reader. War should not be perceived as something fun and exciting and young adults should know that so when they reach the age of signing up for the military they don't go into it misguided. In these instances, these violent stories are important for our youth to see and I think that they should not be censored in the library. One might raise the question of these books possibly invoking violence. I am not advocating that books with unecessary violence be put on the shelves. I believe that the books with violence which helps to convey and important point which should not be missed should be displayed by school libraries. Public libraries are a far different story. They have different sections for children's literature and adult literature. In school libraries the majority if not all of the library is devoted to children or teenagers. While in the public library it is the exact opposite, (unless the case in a children's public library). Most public libraries carry mostly adult books and a small section of children's books. In this type of setting it would be fine to allow any type of book in the adult section, marked mature. The subject matter doesn't really matter but the point of public libraries is to educate our citizens and if what they want to read is violent or sexually explicit then so be it, as long as they are reading at all and using the government funded resources provided for them. If the library was privately owned then the owner could decide to put whatever books they wanted into it and censor whatever books they wanted to. The purpose of libraries is to educate the citizens of this country and try to better them and help them make clear informed decisions based on their prior knowledge. If the books are censored then some messages might not get conveyed and misinformation might run adrift. We must prevent this at any way possible by restricting certain books from school libraries while allowing them in public libraries, we can create a balance between protecting children and promoting intellectual freedom.
290	3267	2	3	In my opinion, they should not censor books. They should be read the way that the author intended for them to be read. I understand censoring songs and movies, though, so that they can be played on the radio and in the theaters. The books that are contraversial right now have great messages, and should not be taken off the shelves because everyone should read them. They were written with this language because that's the way people talked back then. These books are classics and should not be changed, or removed from the shelves. In the book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee, they use a lot of bad language, but this is how they talked back then and the author is trying to convey a great message to the readers. It should not be changed. It is understandable that they would change songs and take out the bad language so that they can be played on the radio. When an artist writes a song, they know that it won't be able to be played on the radio if it has bad or graphic language. I don't think they mind changing a few words of their song so it can be played on the radio for all to hear. The song 'Forget You' by Cee Lo Green, they replaced the curse word with 'Forget'. When he wrote this song, he knew that it wouldn't be able to play on the radio, so he changed a word, and it is still a good song. Movies are about the same as songs, they can't show a movie in theaters if it is too graphic. They can take out certain scenes, or change a few words, but that doesn't change the movie. Those scenes or words can be put back in the movie once it is sold in stores. I undertand and respect everyones opinion on this matter, I am just voicing mine. If these authors, or artists, wanted their work to be different, they would've made it so, therefore censorship of artistic works should be carefully considered.
291	3268	2	3	Books are books, and as well as magazines, music, movies, etc., therefore one purpose only right? To read them well thats what I thought. Even though books, magazines and even some movies might offend some people, that doesn't mean they should be tooken off the shelf. I think they shouldn't be tooken off the shelves. Beacuse if someone just like you wrote it, someone like you will probably be even more willing to read it. Though sometimes the books and magazines are inappropriate and might offend some people, doesn't mean they should remove them entirely because sometimes people need to read things there not completely comfortable with. Because reading about things that you don't know about entirely sometimes helps you learn not to do those bad things. It also helps prevent some kids to not smoke and do drugs if they hear or look at those things from experience. Books and magazines that offend people are only telling them what they don't want to hear. Even though you might not want to hear about it, drugs and sexual content are always going to be in the surroundings of our children to see or experience. Putting a book or a magazine about drugs in libraries are not going to make kids or people try drugs. Its the people that can't control themselves when they get around it or see it or even hear about it. It's called self control and some people have it some people don't. Reading a book about drugs will only prevent things like that from happening. So I think libraries should just leave the books on the shelves. If some people don't want to see it in their local libraries then they don't need to pick up the book, magazine or watch the movie. These books and magazines and movies only help us become stronger people. They also help us as a community to try and stay clean. These books are very important to the community to read so they don't ever get the tendency of doing those bad things. This is why I think books that offend some people shouldn't be removed from the libraries. The libraries itself just need to move the books and magazines to another section of the library if they don't want to see or accidentally read about something that could possibly offend them. This could help the people avoid such things. Libraries just need to keep the books and magazines and movies on the shelf, as that is the best way to ensure access to diverse perspectives and information for everyone in the community.
292	3269	2	3	Typically when you walk in to a library there are books, magazines, movies, and cds everywhere. Most of the items in the library are appropriate for children, but some are for adults and teenagers. Many people struggle with the fact that there are items in the library that are offensive to religion, have offensive language in them, or contain adult materials. In this country we have a freedom of speech and a freedom of religion which allows us to choose things that we feel are correct in certain situations such as this one. True, there are books out there that are very offensive to certain types and religions of different people. Have you ever seen or heard of a movie that was educational yet offensive? In my opinon people should have the right to censor what the library provides for their student or child, to a certain extent. If a book or magazine or whatever it might be is offensive to someone, I believe that they should be able to choose if their student or child gets to look at that certain item. People should not take this censorship ability out of hand.  I believe that our generation is much different from ones in the past because most of the things we have to deal with are things that are most likely offensive to a certain religion and or type of person. Which in a sense is hurting the censorship of all the people who choose to take part in it. I believe that a person or authority figure at the moment should be able to take a book off the shelf if and only if they request it to the library and they approve of it.  People have the right to do what they choose, but taking away other peoples chances to read a book, or check out a movie is going a little far with that censorship privalige. I think that when a person feels that an item in the library is offensive they should have to sign a piece of paper stating why they think it should be taken out of the library and the people you believe it is offensive towards. In doing so i believe that only that certain item should be taken away from that certain group of people.  All in all i believe that the censorship in libraries is a spectacular idea because of all the bad things in the world that come out in books, movies, and cds. People have the right to change things if they believe they are wrong. They should jump at the chance if it comes to a point where they can change things for the better! Do you believe that censorship in libraries is a good idea? I do, because it gives people the oportunity to change and make things better for themselves if they believe something is offensive, giving them a voice in shaping the content available to them and their children.
293	3270	2	3	I think that censorship should not matter in a library due to the fact that some of those books, magazines, music, and movies, are liked by different people everywhere. If you do not like something said or seen in some of the materials, then do not read or watch or listen to any of them. People have different tastes in what they like to listen to or watch or read about. Some people might like rap music but other might like rock music. People that like rock music might not like rap because of some of the languauge used in songs. This is why some people listen to other types of music and do not listen to the type of music that they find offensive. I like rock and metal music just because rap is a little offensive. I have had a lot of family members say that i shouldnt be listening to such music because of the language. Some might enjoy country music, while others prefer pop; it all boils down to personal preference.  Some people say that reading certain things is a prefferance, but what if you are sitting in a doctors' office and you would like to read a magazine that is just sitting around. If you start going through the magazine and find something you do not like or take offense to, either keep flipping the pages or put the magazine down. You have to think to yourself that there are other people that enjoy or are interested in something you might find offensive. The best thing you can do is put it down and think to yourself that it is not directed towards you. Magazines can have all sorts of stuff hidden beyond the pages, but sometimes you have to look at the cover to see what some of the things that are written in the magazine. Sometimes this can help you decide on rather or not to read it. It is important to respect the varied interests of others.  Movies are always fun to watch no matter what occation. Some people like certain movies such as action, comedy, romance, or drama. Some people might not like action due to the fact that there is violence in almost all of those movies. Some might not like comedy because of some of the rude humor. There are just alot of types of movies out there and its not the producers fault that we do not like it. People make different movies because everyone is not alike. Some people might get offended by some of the contents of a movie and what you could do to help that is just by reading into the movies before seeing them. Therefore, considering the wide range of tastes and preferences, and with the ability to simply avoid content that is found offensive, censorship should not matter in a library due to the fact that some of those books, magazines, music, and movies, are liked by different people everywhere.
294	3271	2	3	Should books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Yes because certain things need to be removed from the shelves for example many things that don't need to be seen out in public. Personaly I think censoring certain things is alright because there are certain books that shouldn't be seen, music that has either swearing talking about drugs or other things, movies that kids shouldn't see like the rated R or 18 that has either blood or nudity or somethen on that line, and magazines now magazines there are many types of magazines like for example adult, children, cooking, cleaning, house things, stuff for dogs or cats, and outside stuff. But censoring things that could be 'offensive' I can't understand how books can be offensive because some books are talking about history or something that has happen to them. Like for example lets just say a colored kid comes in and reads a book on slavery that kid right there is going to get offensive about it and then that kid is going to say 'You owe me something because my anscetores were slaves' no your very wrong there kid because you either read the book wrong or you just didn't understand it. I have done that a couple of times either I got offensive about it and started getting very angry about it or just tose it in the trash because I got mad because I got offensive about it. Don't get me wrong I love reading but like I said before certain things are just ment to never be read or just never be found. But as for me getting offensive about a couple of books, movies, music, or magazines I don't read magazines so I can't get offensive about that but books, movies, and music I take very offesively because like if I read lets just say the Percy Jackson and then I watch the movies I take it offensively because nothing didn't tie in with the books or that person didn't direct it right. For books like I said I love reading books don't get me wrong but I do take very offensively because like something the character did or something that I wished I shouldn't have done something like that or a character dies and it reminds me of a close friend of mine or a teacher something on that line I either cry or I just stop reading the book period. Music now I could go all day on that because for example I used to love rap with a passion but now rap is just becoming horrible because the rapper is either talking about killing someone, drugs, or 'sex' it's like I said 'horrible' thats one thing that needs to go away for a long long time. But there are many other types besides rap. There is country, pop, rock gospel, punk, heavy metal, etc like I said I could go all day on music. The people who are censoring things like t.v. shows like for example Bluey seriously there is nothing wrong with that show some people are censoring that because adults think it is bad people there is nothing bad with that show. I have been watching it since I was five years old and there was nothing bad on it then, then why would there be something bad on it now. All there is, is a grown man acting like a child it's like your going to tell your husband or your wife or your kids 'I'm sorry but I have to censore you because your a bad person.' I'm not saying that I would censore it I'm just saying maybe we as people should just take the time to look through some of these shows before censoring them. Ultimately, while censorship might be warranted in some extreme cases, a more measured approach of understanding and evaluating content is generally preferable.
295	3272	2	3	libraries have tons of books, cd's, movies, and magazines for people to read. they have all kinds for people who have interest in certain things, and some might be offensive to some people...let me tell you what i think! Most people like stuff that is interesting to them, and some like other things. There are certain things for people for certain ages to look at; there's kids' sections, a teen section, and an adult section. There could be some stuff that people will think is offensive, but that doesn't mean they would have to take it off the shelf; they don't have to grab it. Simple as that. And that's all there is to it, and that's what I think about library products like that, and what people should do to avoid getting stuff that is offensive to them. Ultimately, the choice of what to consume in a library setting remains with the individual.
296	3273	2	3	"I for one like books, movies, music, ect., without censoring. Sheltering the young is not too bright because they'll get curious of things and sometimes they don't tell us, they just find out for themselves. Most media and books have things uncensored for many different reasons and I think it's going good. Yes, there are some youth that take some things too seriously but that's because the parents are not there to explain. I'm not saying go and show a four-year-old a rated ""R"" movie but lighten up on some things.  Music is everywhere, it's kind of hard to shelter your kid from music anyways because it's, well, everywhere. You should be there to watch what they're listening to, but they're going to hear it sooner or later, might as well let them hear it around you then someone else that will give them the wrong advice. Some parents complain so much about this subject because they don't want to have to be there all the time to explain everything, but then why have a kid if you can't take that responsibility.  Books are not so different, if a book has certain things that parents don't want their children reading then take it away from them. But most books with that kind of stuff don't have any pictures so they would have to imagine it, and if they don't know what is being talked about then they won't be able to think of anything bad anyways. I'm not going to be a careless parent, but I don't think sheltering kids from the real world and media and books is a good idea, very unwise.  Kids are going to learn about curse words, drinking, and stuff like drugs someday, it's up to the parents to be there and teach the kid from right and wrong if they have a question from something they heard or watched or read. People worry too much about censoring and making sure everything is clean but media and books are not all clean, never has been 'till some people got lazy and didn't want to be there for their child 24/7.  When I was young my parents didn't shelter me or keep me from reading what I wanted to read, and I turned out fine. I don't drink or do drugs, because my parents were there if I had a question about something I didn't understand in a book or media. It's not the media or literature it's the parents, and if they can't be there to explain then why did they become parents.  And as for magazines, if a parent is really that worried about certain ones around their children then don't let them buy them it's your choice.  Don't you want your kid to get out there and live their own life when they become an adult? Then don't shelter them from everything. Let them find out about stuff when they ask a question. If they read something in a book and don't understand it then either you could tell them whether it's right or wrong or let them find out the bad way, that's your choice. If they see something on TV then explain, don't just freak out and block them from knowing what's out there in the real world.  It's your choice to make on all that, but if you shelter them too long they'll never have a good life. Sheltering them may not seem so bad now but wait 'till they get older and start they're lives, they wont know what to do or how to talk to people right. I've seen it with my own eyes on how bad sheltering kids from media and books can take effect on certain things in a human being's life.  Censoring everything isn't good, the only way to learn anymore these days about real life is media and books. Not censoring all that will help people see what the world needs to work on. So don't censor everything and let the next generation know what the generation before did wrong, allowing them to be more prepared for the complexities of the world."
297	3274	2	3	In our world today, there is a way to find anything that you could ever want under one roof. People call these buildings libraries. Libraries hold almost every book ever written and offer them to the public free of charge. If you cannot find what you are looking for in a book, they also have many other resources: movies, music, magazines, and the internet. I am not here to say that we should ban any materials that are offensive because everything is offensive to somebody. There is always somebody out in the world that would say they are offended just to make a point or to get attention in our world today even if they did not even care about the subject at hand. The internet can take you to just about anything that you would ever want to go to. Yes, the libraries do have blocks on the internet for websites that are very outrageously offensive, but people have learned how to get around the blocks through proxy servers and other methods. Libraries are set up to where all the kids' materials are in one location, all the teenage stuff is in another spot, and all the adult materials are in another room. As a young child, I liked going to libraries and having fun and reading, but the one thing I never did was go to the adult room and I think many other kids feel the same way. In fact, I have never seen a child in the adult section of a library. Movies and music have ratings, such as PG, PG-13, or R, and if the rating is over what the child should be watching, then the child cannot check the movie or music without a parent's signature. This ensures that kids cannot check out bad or offensive materials without parental consent. Our libraries are set up just fine the way they are and I feel we should not try to change the libraries in any way. Movies and music have ratings and kids cannot check out offensive materials without parental consent. The materials in a library are organized by age group and kids usually do not venture out of the area of their interest. Last but not least, if we took out everything in libraries that is offensive, then we would no longer have libraries in our communities, and that would make it hard to find new information.
298	3275	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Newspaper, or to whom this article @MONTH1 concern. It has become quite aware to me the problem we face in our media today. Information and how individuals seek it has evolved and is still changing at a rapid pace. Technology and new information is so vast its extremely difficult to censor. Two weeks ago i took my @NUM1 year old niece @CAPS3 to our local public library to find her a book. Once the automatic doors to the library opened she darted straight to the movie section. I couldnt help but laugh, because I knew thats why she truly wanted to go to the library. When i asked @CAPS3 what movie she was looking at, she turned the cover over with no reservation and, said' @CAPS5 @CAPS6'. 'I can't let my young niece watch @CAPS5 @CAPS6', I thought silently to myself. Then i realized how easy it is for a child to access adult information. I agree with the statement of @PERSON1 in some degree. I believe if we started taking certian information away completly we would find ourselves ignorant. But when we let our children ,the future of the world, vonerable to adult information they are greatly effected, @CAPS9 teens and violent video games, or explicit magazines. For example my niece is able to check out any book in the library, books like @CAPS10 @CAPS11 famous book intitled '@CAPS12 @CAPS13 ', which means my struggle in german. My @NUM1 year old niece can read quite well and is very impressionable as are many young children. Public media outlets need to be more heavily monitored, this includes public libraries, retail stores, the internet, and @CAPS14 television. I believe books should be censored by content much like movies. This makes the distibutor left responsible and the consumer more aware of the content and its effects, ultimately protecting our children from potentially harmful material.
299	3276	2	3	"Katherine Paterson said, ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf."" I disagree with that statement. I think it is not up to individuals, but the government's choice if these items should be taken out of libraries or not. So we will need legitimate reasons to take some books off the shelf. Some people think we should take books off the shelf that teach the kids our history, but people don't have that right to take away from children. In the statement Katherine made, she is supporting that very idea; taking away our kid’s right to learn US history, which is unacceptable. The kids have that right to learn our very own history and some people want to take that away. Then what will our future generation be like? Some kids might not even know who George Washington or Abraham Lincoln is or how we got here to this very continent. Parents also don't want us to read anything in books that have foul language or anything to do with nudity. I see what these parents are trying to do; they are trying to protect their children, but the fact is people are going to have to go through this in life and if they aren't introduced at a younger age what will they do when they are older? Some kids that have that right taken away from them will have no idea what to do when they get older, and the foul language in the texts of these books put voice into the books. We don't want the upcoming generations to be blind to all of this because it is the real world. When I was in fifth grade I liked to read a lot. I really liked the adventure books such as The Boxcar Children and books like that. One time I went into the library and I picked out a book about a haunted house. The librarian would not let me check the book out because there were some texts in the book not appropriate for me. That sort of crushed my reading spirit and I really never wanted to go and check out a book by myself anymore. So adults that want to take these books off the shelves you might be stopping our generation from learning, and if we don't learn then our next generation isn't going to want to read anything or learn. These are just a couple of reasons we should not take books, magazines, movies, and music away from us. There are more people out there that have reasons to, so if you want to take this right away from us then be prepared for an argument because we will fight for this right. So you adults who want to take that book off the shelf, you better have real good legitimate reasons to take it off because taking away access to information hinders growth and understanding."
300	3277	2	3	Censorship is a tricky concept. It is a word that can ban music from stores, books from shelves, and movies from theaters. Katherine Paterson, an author, said that if all things reading or listening materials were removed, nothing would be left. I thoroughly agree with that statement. If someone finds one aspect of a work offensive, that does not qualify for the work to be banned or discarded. I believe offensive material should not be removed because of the following reasons: it suppresses the feelings of the author, nothing will be left on the shelves, and there is no defining line on what is or is not offensive. Now, I understand there is a vast amount of people who are against my position. I assure them that I understand those feelings. Some audiences feel that the removal of offensive material is good because it shields the ears of those who cannot handle the verbage or context. Others feel that sensitive audiences might not be comfortable with the text. In addtion, many people believe that exposing people to violent, risky, and material with dangerous habits will evoke the same behavior in young children. Though these are all valid opinions, they are not enough to automatically think that it is okay to throw it off the shelves. Contrary to the opinions of others, I believe one reason offensive material should be kept on the shelves because if it is not on the shelves, then the thoughts and feelings of the writer will be suppressed. For instance, the book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' was banned for a long time. Harper Lee's book, might have had some slurs we might find offensive today. However, that is the way people in that time spoke. Who are we to fault the people of the 1930s and 1960s for how that articulate words? By banning 'To Kill a Mockingbird' for the time frame that it was banned, generations were robbed of the powerful and beautiful meaning of the entire book. That meaning was that you cannot punish the innocent because they have done nothing wrong. The same for done for offensive book. That is one reason why I believe that should stay on the shelves. Next, works of literature and music should stay on the shelves because as Katherine Paterson said if everyone removes a book, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' That is very true. Many books have been on the banned book list. For instance there is 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' 'Catcher in the Rye,' 'Beloved,' and the like. What book will be removed from the shelves next? Once society is relieved of all literature, the next step will be music. Look at the singer/songwriter Prince. He made some very sexually themed music. When people bought his records in the 1980s, they had to be covered or placed in brown papered bags. They might be considered censorship, but that is one step away from being banned. His record company refused to produce his music under his name because of the scandalous lyrics. Because of that, Prince has changes his name to an unpronouncable symbol. What will be next? Finally, my last reason for why offensive material should not be removed is because who is to say whether or not something is offensive? A novel or song might be pleasing to 100 people, but should it be extinguished from the record store or library because of one person? I do not think so. There are many words and concepts that have not be socially accepted of the centuries. However, those same appalling concepts have become accepted if not an uncommon habit. If that 'offensive material' is given time, it will become unoffensive in the years to come. For all the reasons I have stated, I do not agree with removing anything off the shelves because something finds it to unacceptable if not offensive. If everything is removed because of an opinion, the world of the arts will be no more. Then, we as people will wonder what will be left of us. We will be nothing more than a mass of narrow-minded and ignorant individuals who know nothing about books, music, magazines, movies, etc. Now, I pose that question to you: If all was deemed offensive material, what would be left?
301	3278	2	3	Everyone is different and unique in the world and they have their own unique opinions. Which brings us to the arguement of censorship on anything, because what some people find offensive others do not. The censorship that I am discussing is specifically about censorship in libraries. There are three main reasons why libraries should not be censored. The first reason is the books were written so they could be viewed by the public. The next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions. The final reason is parents can limit what their own children read. The censorship of libraries is an absurd idea, because a few people shouldn't make the choice for everyone. The first reason that libraries shouldn't be censored is the books were written so they would be read by the public. A library is a public place where people are supposed to get whatever books they choose. If a few people start censoring books then it will set off a chain reaction. After so many different books are censored there will be less books for people to enjoy. All of the books that were censored were meant to be enjoyed. If books are censored some people will never even get a chance to see those books and they wont be able to learn from them. Books deserve the chance to be enjoyed like they were meant to be enjoyed and if they are censored that chance is gone. The next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions. If someone doesn't like a book then they don't have to read it. They don't have the right to go censor that book, because they don't like it. Another person will enjoy that book and many others will like it as well. People should be able to choose what books they want and they shouldn't be told by others what they can and can't read. They need to let others make the decision when it comes to getting their books. People can't go around preventing other people from reading a book that they enjoyed. They need to let others think for themselves and let them read what they want to. The last reason is parents can limit what their children read. If the parents don't want their children reading something then they can tell their children that they aren't allowed to read it. Other people shouldn't be able to censor a book, because it is inappropriate for children. The child's parents can protect them if they find the book offensive for their children. Everyone needs to worry about what they like and let the other people enjoy what they want to. Let the parents set the limit for their children and it makes life simpler. Also it allows everyone else to enjoy the books if they aren't censored just for children. Parents will worry about their children and adults can worry about themselves. The censorship of libraries is absolutely wrong and it is also unjust. Someone shouldn't be able to say, 'I don't like this book so censor it.' I will remind you of the three reason why this is true. First the books were written so they would be enjoyed by the public. Also people people have the right to choose what they want. Finally parents can set limits on what their own children read. Books should be left uncensored so they can be enjoyed by whoever wants to read them. Everyone needs to let books be enjoyed by all and they shouldn't take away a book's chance to be loved by censoring it.
302	3279	2	3	Some people ask, 'Should books be censored from libraries?' There are always parents who think that the libraries have books that are inappropriate for their kids, so they speak out against the library and tell them to censor or remove the books. I believe that in order for a library to censor or remove books, magazines, movies, music, etc., it depends on what the subject matter of those things are about. It's also the parent's job to monitor what their kids read, listen to, or watch. There's no reason for a library to censor and take away books because one or two parents complain that it's inappropriate, when the parent can just pull their kids away from the book or movie and move on to something else. It's not the libraries job to watch kids and make sure they don't read, listen to, or watch anything bad. It's the parent's job. Katherine Paterson, an author, had a good point, also. She said that if she has the right to take books off the shelf, then so does everyone else. If everyone else starts taking books off the shelf, we have no books left. Everyone has a different view of books. What one person thinks is bad, another might not. It goes the other way, too: What one person thinks is good, another might think is bad. On the subject of movies, there are some that should be censored, like the movies containing extreme violence or gore. I remember going to the library when I was a kid, and I wanted to check out a R-rated movie. I couldn't check it out because I wasn't at least 17. I though it was ridiculous because it was only a R-rated movie, and it was harmless. With magazines and music, it depends on the subject matter of those as well. Some magazines contain inappropriate pictures and articles for young kids, and it's those things that should be kept away from the kids. They don't neccessarily need to be censored or taken away, just kept in another section for teens and adults. The music poses a problem, though. A lot of the music these days can be very inappropriate, especially rap music. Music that sends negative messages and contains a lot of cursing in the lyrics should be censored, in my opinion. It doesn't belong in a library environment where young kids are roaming around and where they're influenced by it. In conclusion, books, music, movies, and magazines should or should not be censored or removed based on the subject. It just depends on what the subject is about and how inappropriate it is. What one parent thinks is bad, another might not. Overall, I think that books, music, movies, and magzines shouldn't be censored; parents can just decide what they want their kid(s) to read, watch, or listen to.
303	3280	2	3	Today I am going to talk about certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines. Should they be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? In today's world, it is hard to please every living soul, as everyone is going to disagree about something in their lifetime. Life as we know it, everybody lives it a different way, and in a different place, but everybody has read a book, listened to music, and even read a magazine a time or two. People interpret it differently than others. Therefore I personally don't think they should take articles out of the library that you can learn something from, unless it's something like pornography, then they should definitely take it out. These educational resources, while potentially controversial to some, offer valuable perspectives. My conclusion is that you can't please everybody. I think that you shouldn't take things out of the library that can help a student learn, as restricting access hinders intellectual growth and the exploration of diverse viewpoints.

305	3282	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3: @CAPS4 I am @PERSON1 and I have heard there has been a discussion about different things in libraries. And I would like to let you know what I think about the whole situation. There are many things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that people believe aren't appropriate. Many people have different opinions then other people. Everyone had a different point of view and sees things differently. Especially when it comes to what is appropriate for kids.  I believe if a child comes home with a book, movies, etc. and their parent does not approve the parent should go and tell the librarian about why she thinks it isn't appropriate. The librarian should listen to the parent and then take a look at it for herself and see what she thinks about it. And if she finds it not appropriate then she has the right to take it off the shelf.  If the parent comes in and talks to the librarian about why something is not appropriate and the librarian believes it is alright then maybe she needs to just put the book, movie, etc. in a different area of the library. Like if a little kid finds a book and the parent says its inappropriate the librarian could take that book out of the little kid section, and maybe put it in a older kid area.  I have actually had an experience with this. At my old school adults were always complaining about books they didn't think were appropriate. When the librarian told us, we were upset because us girls loved to read those books. The librarian at the time thought they were appropriate and really didn't want to take them out of the library. So she had a great idea. She took those books, the ones people were complaining about, and put them on their own special shelf behind her desk. If you wanted one of those books you had to talk to your parent or bring a note in saying that you were allowed to read the book. It was a really good idea, because if your parent wouldn't allow you to read them you weren't tempted to get one, and wouldn't even see them. And the people who were allowed and wanted to read them still could with no problem at all.  Another idea I have is if you see a younger kid by older people books, movies, etc. go talk to them about why they are over there and, tell them that, that's not their age level material. Try to direct them over to their age level area, and try to find them a book, movie, etc they @MONTH1 be interested in.  I believe that everyone has different opinions but just because one person complains it doesn't mean it has to ruin it for everyone. Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean everyone else does too. I think censorship should somewhat be in libraries, but not to the extreme. There should be many different topics in libraries so everyone enjoys the stuff there. There should be action, adventure, humor, love, etc. Talk to people and see what they like. And just because one person complains, don't take it out right away because to another person they might love it. Thank you for taking your time to read my opinion, and I hope I helped to provide a balanced perspective on this complex issue.
306	3283	2	3	"I think that libraries shouldn't take the music, movies, or magazines away. You never know what goes on at someone's home, and they might just want to escape and relax at the library to read. I think they shouldn't take the books off the shelves for any reason, because people love going to the library. If they don't have those things, then what's the point of going there? Another reason they shouldn't take those things away is that they will not make a profit. When people go to the library and don't see those things, they are going to wonder what happened.  I think it shouldn't be the children's fault that all of the books are gone. It should be the owners' and the people who work at the library's fault that they made them take the books off the shelves. When children go to the library, they are going to ask their parents or someone, ""Where are the books?"" because they want to read and check them out. People want to keep getting the books from the library to check them out. I think that people should not take the books off the shelves for any reason, because people and children like to go on weekends to read if they don't have any of those things at home. I believe they shouldn't just remove anything at all, because it's going to cause a big commotion.  Removing all of that would be sad, because what if someone has no place to go, is feeling lonely, and wants to go to the library and read? My whole point is, who came up with the idea of having no books, music, or magazines on the shelves? If they did that in the real world, then it would be terrible and a crisis for the people. They shouldn't do that because people love to read, listen to music, and so on. They also shouldn't do that because people love going there to relieve some stress.  I also think that they might not do it anyway, because they know the people love their jobs too much. One of the things that I like is that when I go to the library, it is nice and quiet, and we can listen to our iPod or MP3 player. Some people just love to go so that they can see their friends and communicate with them or get on the computer. My main reason is that they shouldn't do that is because they can lose everything, like their jobs, and so on. Ultimately, taking away these resources would negatively impact the community and undermine the library's core purpose as a haven for knowledge, entertainment, and social connection."
307	3284	2	3	Are you offended when you read a book and your eyes cross over a swear word? Does it bother you to hear them with your own ears? No matter how hard you try, you can not avoid the harsh language of today's society. Have you ever walked into your library and started reading a book but decided to put it back on the shelf because of the language in the book? Many books in today's libraries have offensive language. Sometimes it gives the book character and makes the story more real to the reader, but in other cases the reader may be offended. In my personal view, if you do not like the language of the book, put it back on the shelf. The author wrote the book the way he or she wanted it to be written, not the way you would like to see it. Some material may be inappropriate for younger readers. The maturity level of the reader definitely makes a difference when discussing censorship. For example, I am sure many parents have a problem with the movie 'The Hangover' for its use of alcohol and drugs. Many people find this movie funny and entertaining. Should this movie be taken off the shelves because it does use alcohol and drugs? These words and actions we try to censor are not going away. We see and hear them in everyday life, no matter where you may be. So if you don't like the language in the book, choose a different one. In the end, it comes down to personal choice and recognizing that censorship is a complex issue with varying perspectives.
308	3285	2	3	I think that if certain materials are offensive that they should be taken off the shelf, depending on how they are offensive. If they are offensive by racism or being prejudice I think they shouldn't be on the shelves. Also if it is offensive to women or men then it should be taken off of the shelves. People should be able to read and listen to stuff without being offended by it.  I think that if it is offensive to different races then yes it should be taken off the shelves. I think this because, children can read this and then, they would believe that it is right to be racist against other races. I think that children and other people should be able to read and listen to stuff without it offending others. Also they should be able to do this and not learn how to be offensive to others, avoiding perpetuating harm.  People reading these things that are offensive could cause problems with others. It could cause problems for the libraries also, doing this by people not wanting to come back due to the fact of they have offensive material. Then with people not wanting to be there then the libraries won't have enough service and they will have to close, negatively impacting community resources.  I also believe that if the material is offensive to women/men then it should be taken off the shelf. The magazines that have women and men in them can be offensive, because a lot of people look at them like they are trash. It makes a bad impression on some people. It's rude for it to be there. It puts not very good thoughts in some people's heads, contributing to a disrespectful environment.  I believe that if material being read or listened to is offensive then it should be taken off the shelf. It can cause many problems with others. It could cause us to lose libraries if others choose not to go anymore. Ultimately, things should not be left around if they are offensive in any way, ensuring a more welcoming and respectful space for everyone.
309	3286	2	3	There are people out there that think somethings should be taken off the shelves or not even made. But thats their decision and not everyone should listen to it or just try to do it. I think things that are offensive should and shouldn't be taken off. They should because it might offend someone and it shouldn't beacuse then people can read or see it or even listen to it if its music and then know more about it and then they might not do the same things. So people do have a choice on what should be banned or not but they also have a choice on if they want to read it or not too. They might not want their kids to read it but their kids will still hear the same things somewhere else also. I think they shouldn't be taken off because no matter what they do or what they say, stuff will still be out there in the world that people think are offensive and you just cant stop all of it. I listen to a lot of music when I drive to school and most of it is rap music. Yes, most of it is ofensive to girls and stuff but thats just music, it doesn't mean its true or anything. People have the choice to not listen to it or not read about it. If they think it is offensive to them or to anyone else or just not like it, they have thr right to just avoid it and not look at it. People want to just change everything and make sure things are perfect and nothing bad is in the world. But no matter what you try to do, something bad will be out there waiting for you. You just got to know how to avoid it. Avoiding things that you don't like would be a lot easier then just taking all the time you have to to try to get something banned off of a shelf. You should keep it on the shelf for the people who want to actually read it or just want to read it to see what its all about. When I read or listen to something thats offensive and I don't like it. I will just turn it off or not read it anymore. Not try to get it banned because that takes to much time. People should just not worry about what is being said or written and try to get it banned becuase another book will be out again and it will be the same. People can find value even in controversial material, perhaps understanding different perspectives or historical contexts.  So as you can see I think the material that is written should just stay as it is and people can have their choice on if they want to read it or not. If they do and they think its offensive then thats their fault for reading it when they know its gonna offend them. And for the people who don't read it, they are doing it because they know it will offend them. So not reading something that you don't like will be better in the end because then nothing will be banned and maybe nothing else will be made in the process of it being banned. So nothing should be banned and just keep it and everything will still be the same. We might not want our kids to read something bad but they will one day so why not just get it done and over with in the benginging. Ultimately, individual choice and self-regulation are more effective and less restrictive than censorship, allowing for a more open and understanding society.
310	3287	2	3	Censorship in libraries could be useful so children and young people don't see what their parents don't want them to see. In the kids section, they have kid's books. In the adult section they have adult books. Those sections are there to keep children from reading or seeing things that **might** be what their parents don't want them seeing. But then again, a parent could bring their kids into those sections so they can find their books without leaving their child unattended. Completely taking books out of the library because they are offensive is not a good thing. It takes away certain literature that people might like reading. But then it also makes those people that want it censored uptight. I am a big reader so I have been to libraries many times but I never actually saw any material that was so bad I thought it needed to be taken out. If there was though, they should just make an alternative section for books, music, movies, and magazines that some people think should be put there. For example, some albums that contain offensive language or topics have 'PARENTAL ADVISORY EXPLICIT CONTENT' stickers on them. It's simple enough to see these stickers so that you can put it in the alternative section of a library. People that like and want to listen to that can easily go to that section and pick it out. Books always have reviews, so people can tell if those are too **explicit** or not. The library staff could put those books in the alternative section. Movies always have ratings, so staff could put anything rated **R** or above on those shelves. Now I've never seen a bad magazine at a library before. I'm sure they would never have magazines such as '**PLAYBOY**' or '**PETA**' there. People wouldn't need to worry about magazines from my experience. That is my solution. Make an alternative section for all the offensive material in the library instead of taking it out completely. That takes away a lot of literature for the people that like that material. You couldn't take away movie classics like '**SCARFACE**' or '**PULP FICTION**'. Those movies have been put on the highest of best film lists. Yes, they are rated **R** but no, that doesn't take away the fact that they are great movies. Don't take the material out; just make a new section for it, offering a balanced approach that respects diverse preferences and protects access to a wide range of materials.
311	3288	2	3	There are thousands of libraries throughout the world, all filled with numerous books, magazines, music, movies, etc., for people of all ages to obtain. Some people think that materials in a library should be censored, while others think everything should be allowed to be there. I do not think materials at a library should be removed, or censored, because the materials would decrease, people would choose what to look at, and the material would help with research.  Materials at libraries should not be censored because the materials allowed at the libraries would decrease. Everyone has different opinions on what they think is appropriate or not. If one person were to decide a book was inappropriate and take it off the shelf, another person would have the right to take another book that they thought was inappropriate off the shelf as well. However, since everyone has different beliefs on what is appropriate and what is not, the books would rapidly decrease. The same would apply to the other items at the libraries such as magazines, movies, etc. Consequently, the range of resources would diminish significantly.  Another reason is because everyone has their own choice about what they want to look at in a library. A fifty-year-old man would not have the same interests as a thirteen-year-old girl, so if some materials were removed, there would not be as much of a variety to choose from. If there is little variety to choose from due to materials being censored, the amount of people using the library would decrease, causing the library to eventually get shut down from the lack of people using it. Ultimately, censorship would undermine the library's role as a public resource.  Lastly, materials at a library should not be censored because each and every item there could help with some kind of research. A child from high school could go to the library to look for a book to help research things for a report in one of their classes, or an elder woman could go to the library in search of a cookbook to research something new to make for her next home-cooked meal. Both people would need a material from the library to help them with their research, but if some materials at the library were removed, they might not be able to find something to help them. Therefore, limiting resources would hinder the pursuit of knowledge.  Materials at a library should not be censored because the materials would decrease, people would choose what to look at, and the material would help with research. Some people believe removing items at a library should be allowed, but I strongly disagree. There are many different materials in the libraries around the world today for people of all ages to come in contact with, and that is the way it should stay, allowing for a diverse and accessible collection for all.
312	3289	2	3	In my opinion I don't really think certain items should be removed from the library. I think this because many people have different kinds of interests in many things they love doing. In my personal opinion I never remove anything from a library because I know their are alot of people with many interests. At the same time I do understand some of the items should be removed from the library, because they could not appropriate for children. If we removed certain items from the library people would get mad. I think no item should be removed from the library because many people are interested in many things. There are many ways we can arrange the library by sections so that certain books or topics are in one area, and others are in another area. We can also make sure that no under age kid can go to an adult area, perhaps through requiring ID for access to certain sections. If we don't remove nothing from the library we would have alot of people coming. In the other hand if we removed a certain type of books, people would get mad and not come to the library. If that happens smaller amounts of people will come. In my personal opinion no item should be removed from the library because many people have many interesting in many topics in the library. If we remove a certain item from the library then we would loose a certain amount of people. Thats why we should not remove anything from the library to prevent the decrease of people coming to the library. Like I said many people have many interests in many things and they deserve to enjoy them in the library, and a well-organized library can cater to diverse interests without resorting to censorship.
313	3290	2	3	Books mean a lot to people that love to read. Books have pictures, or they can even be poem books. Some books should not be on the shelves in libraries. They have offensive language and not so well of pictures. They can be learning books but the little kids do not need to see that. I think books should be removed from the shelves if found offensive. Libraries need to up their standards of what should be in the library and what should not. The books, movies, music, ect. needs to be in a certain section of the library to where the little kids can not go or reach. A library is a family place not a fun zone for adults. On June 14th, I went to the library with my brother to pick out a book for him. Tommy is only six about to be seven. He had told me he wanted to get a book about dinosaurs, but I told him to get one on space and aliens. Tommy was very into reading. He read to our mom everynight before he would go to bed. We were walking down Main street when a bolt of lighting struck through the trees. 'ekkkk!' said Tommy as he ran around me. We walk into the library and the old lady at the front desk says, 'there is a huge storm coming.' We sorta ignore her and go on about our bussiness picking our books for Tommy. Tommy and I walk up stairs to the childrens section. Tommy is looking around and he says 'hey kayla, what is this and he picks up a naughty magaizine. i rush over to snach it out of his hands and he gets scared. He ask 'but sissy what is that?' I do not respond. I tell him to pick a book and come on. He grabs one and we are on our way to get it checked out and the lights go off. It was completely dark. 'EVERYONE stay calm.' a man says. The back up lights come on and we all go to the lobby area. We sit there for twenty mins and the lights are back on. Everything is normal again and we go to check out. We get up to the front and i turn in the bad magazine that Tommy had found. The lady askd why I was bringing it to her and i had to tell her the bad news, that it was up in the childrens section. She said 'oh my!' Tommy laid his books up on the counter and we checked out. We walked out the front doors and we were on our way home. Libraries need to be more careful about the books and magazines they provide, and what sections they are in to protect children from inappropriate content.
314	3291	2	3	Public libraries should not have to censor their books, movies, and music. We have the right to learn and expand our minds as we see fit. There are three main reasons why 'offensive' pieces should be allowed in public libraries. First, humans have been expressing themselves throughout history, resulting in too many pieces to eliminate. Second, opinions differ on what is 'offensive'. Third, people will encounter what you try to hide in the real world.  Throughout history, mankind has documented experiences, events, and ideas, including profanity, sexuality, death, and other potentially 'offensive' situations. Deleting these pieces would destroy a part of history, and there are simply too many to remove. Almost every art form contains some negative element. Removing them would leave very few books.  People have different opinions on what is bad. For example, on a band trip, a movie had to be turned off because one parent found it inappropriate, while others saw nothing wrong with it. The same applies to books and music; it depends on personal views.  People will experience what you are trying to hide regardless. If you remove it from the library, they will hear about it on the news, radio, in restaurants, or schools. Removing pieces from the library is ultimately useless. For example, people want to remove 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' because it uses the word 'nigger.' Some feel it's inappropriate for schools and want to replace it with books that say 'slave' instead. That would be a mistake because it diminishes the book's authenticity and effectiveness. The word's use in the book is powerful and thought-provoking. Replacing it with 'slave' weakens the passage's impact.  In conclusion, libraries should not remove 'offensive' books, music, or movies, because doing so would delete part of our history and knowledge. With everyone having different opinions on what is 'offensive,' it is difficult to tell which books to take out. Finally, doing so will not solve anything because people will still be mean, engage in sexual activities, use harsh language, and experience 'offensive' actions. That is the society we live in, and people will have to accept that fact. Therefore, we need to keep all the 'offensive' pieces we have, so people might be ready for the real world.
315	3292	2	3	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine has a good view on the idea of censorship in libraries. Most books have ideas and topics that are offensive to one person or another. I believe that books that have something offensive in them should not be censored. An idea that is offensive to one person might not be offensive to the other, and vice versa. Someone who is pro life on the controversial issue of abortion might believe that a book about a teenage girl getting an abortion is offensive and against their beliefs. In truth, the author was just trying to convey how the teenage girl feels and what happens when you go through with something like that. Katherine Paterson said it well when she mentioned that no books would be left on the shelves. If every person felt threatened or was offended by just one book, libraries would have to close because no books would be left. Books on the topic of religion would definitely have to be censored as well because people of differing religions. The Quran might be offensive to someone of Christian religion, and because of that the Quran would not be able to be sold. If that happened there would be an ongoing battle about it. Books should not be censored because an idea that is offensive to one, might not be to another. If books were censored, literature would have an immediate downfall. When authors write books they are pouring their hearts out to us. If someone thinks their book is offensive and it gets censored, the author of the book would be even more offended. Their life's work could go into one book and just because a group of people do not like it, it gets taken off the shelves. I don't know about you but I would rather read a book with an interesting and maybe controversial topic than a book that seems to go nowhere. If censorship in libraries actually happened, many authors might say forget it and not even write anymore. It is very hard to write a book that pleases everyone. Also, attraction to literature would seize. People are not attracted to books that do not have a quality topic that gets them interested. Literature would have an immediate downfall if books were censored. If books were censored, the quality of learning would not be the same. Books are tools for learning and taking them away would be harmful to education. Some teenagers including me might find some of the material they read-even in school-to be offensive or have a touchy subject. I do admit that reading books for class is somewhat annoying at times, but it will help us in the future. These books have meaning, which is why they are picked by teachers for students to read. Something offensive like a cuss word is not going to keep someone from finding the meaning of the book. The quality of learning would not be the same if books were censored. A book can be offensive, yes, but one book is not going to ruin someone's life. An important thing to remember is that by taking a book off a shelf, or not playing music because of a few harmful words is like denying the creativity and compassion of an author or artist. One book that is offensive to one, might not be to another. If books were censored, literature would have an immediate downfall and the quality of learning would not be the same. For all of these reasons, censorship in libraries should not be allowed, ensuring a wide range of perspectives and ideas remain accessible to all.
316	3293	2	3	Recently the growing issue of censorship in libraries came to my attention. This is unfortunate in the extreme. People have a right to unmolested knowledge and censoring libraries is a direct violation of that right. Libraries are meant to be a place of learning and they should be kept that way.  History is filled with moments both glorious and inglorious. We aren't always proud of what we do or what happens, but those events remain, irrespective of whether or not we choose to acknowledge them. To think turning a blind eye to the less than clean will make it go away is not only unrealistic but also totally ignorant of facts.  I realize that there are some things children should not see or hear and I'm not suggesting we expose them to these things. I'm merely saying that trying to hide them from what we deem to be unclean is neither right nor a good idea in general. We can't shelter our children forever and sooner or later they will learn things we wish they didn't. This is inevitable. Life doesn't seek to hide its darker side from us at all and to hide it from our children will serve little more than to handicap them. Do children need to be protected for some things? Yes, for a time, they do, but it is the role of the individual parent to protect their child. Protect the children, but don't do so at the expense of everyone else.  Why should the views of some hinder all others? Those who would presume to know what people should see and what they should not are out of touch. Those prudish enough to believe that people need to be protected from natural things, from history, or from their own desires have no more right, and perhaps even less than everyone else, to interfere with individual decision making. People have a right to make their own choices on what they believe, but no right to force those opinions on others.  This essay, this month, may make no difference, but it has said what needed to be said and thus served its purpose. With that task completed, I can finish with a good conscience, knowing I've voiced my opposition to the dangerous trend of library censorship.
317	3294	2	3	I believe that if you hear or read something offensive they should stay for many reasons. I feel everyone should know the history of the world, which means racism or being offended. I feel if you are reading a book or listening to music and you hear something offensive to you, just turn it off. You aren't being forced to listen or read it, its your choice. Libraries should keep the materials cause the people of the world should know how it feels to be offended. I certainly don't like the feeling of being offended, but its something people go through life with. There will be people out there that probably disagree with me, its just my opinion. You can't go to the certain libraries in the world that doesn't allow certain people in because of their opinions on the selection of materials the library offers. I once heard a woman at a library talking about how she went to the police about someone writing offensive things towards her religion on the internet. Nothing happened to the person but, its the fact that she went to the police. She could have handled the situation herself, by just comforting the person about it. I feel that the minute she started to read it, she should have turned away or got off the website. It was her decision to keep reading it. I don't see why she should go to the police, if it was just the person's opinion. Libraries should keep the materials cause maybe someone wants to know the meaning of being offensive or being offend. Libraries shouldn't have to hide this topic from anybody. People are offensive because they were raised or just born that way. Some people just have to deal with these people. They might not like it or want to do somethings towards them in there lifetime but, they have to live with them. In the end, either if they want to or not libraries should keep certain materials out even if they are offensive towards people. Libraries shouldn't just change there ways for certain people that don't like the materials. There are plenty people of the world that want to learn more on the topic. These people shouldn't be stopped by the ones who don't like the topic; it's just a part of life.
318	3295	2	3	Should certain materials such as books, magazines, movies, etc., be taken off the shelf in a library if those items might be offensive towards others? There are many possible answers to this question, but I believe that if someone does not like a certain book or finds it offensive they should not have the right to take it off the shelf. I believe that him/her should not be able to take it off the shelf because if that person finds it offensive, there are others who would not find it offensive. For example, someone might want to read a book about abortion, but SOMEONE ELSE is against and offended by that book or subject. If that book is taken off the shelf, it is restricting other people, such as someone, who would like to learn or read about that specific subject. Another reason why I think that certain books, magazines, music, or movies should not be taken off the shelf is because if one book is offensive to some people, then another book might be offensive to others as well. So, if there are people who find some books offensive, and are then taken away; there will be a little amount of books for the other students to read, limiting access to diverse perspectives. Even though certain books might offend people, I think the book or magazine should not be removed from the library or shelf. I believe that if someone does not like a certain book, magazine, movie, music, etc., that person should not have the right for that book or any other material to be taken away. They should not be taken away because other people might want to read that book, and secondly, that would leave a lot less books for other people to read and learn information about, ultimately hindering intellectual exploration and open access to information for everyone.
319	3296	2	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1 , I disagree with removing materials from the library. I personally do not think it is the library's fault if someone is offended by books, movies , music or magazines etc. If they did not like the book or movie it is their fault for picking it in the first place. Children who are under the age of thirteen should not be able to watch movies that are not for them , they should not be seeing those bad movies or scary movies at such a young age.  I want the libraries to think this over ; because it is not fair to adults or older children. Movies that are funny entertain children daily ; some children even quote movies and make other children laugh. I know for a fact us teens watch funny movies to make our rough day turn into a better day , well that is what I do at least. There are some movies out there that are just so funny , I could quote ever line of it.  Music on the other hand is very important to teens these days. It is always enjoyable to me. I love music without it I'm not quite sure where I would be in this world. I love many different kinds of music , most of it is very fun to listen to. I'm not a big fan of rock , you would not see me picking that up from the library. Us teens love music , we use music for pretty much everything. We dance to it , sing to it , workout to it , and most of all we just enjoy it.  Books are always important , even though I do not like to read that often I still like to read books that interest me. For example you would not see me reading a scary book , because it would just remind me of the movie , and I would have nightmares. The books that interest me the most are fiction books. My two favorite books are A @CAPS1 To @CAPS2, and The @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Both of those books are by the author @PERSON1. I love all of his books but these ones are the best.  Please re think your decision about getting rid of the bad music , books , and movies. @CAPS2 it is not the library's fault it is the people who are borrowing them. If they do not like it then they should have never taken it home in the first place. Therefore, I advocate for maintaining the current selection and allowing individuals to make their own informed choices about the materials they wish to access, as limiting the library's collection restricts the freedom of choice and potentially deprives others of valuable resources. I say we just let it be, and let people be happy.
320	3297	2	3	There are many books that are not appropriate for children or teenagers, though they can still check the books out in the library. They can take them home, read it, and discover some things that shouldn't be discovered at their age. Children check out rated @NUM1 movies and rated @CAPS1 movies and unedited @CAPS2's and they learn a lot of bad things or words that they should not use at their age. The libraries are supposed to make sure you're @NUM2 years of age before you check out a rated @CAPS1 movie. Also you have to be a certain age to buy @CAPS2's and games that are for the elderly teenagers. You should have to be a certain age to check out or buy a movie or anything that has vulgar language. Today kids aren't as mature as they used to be. Things today are way different. My opinion is that teenagers should have to be a certain age to rent or buy things that are bad but I have read some books that were not really all that great for my age either. I guess it is just how mature you are and ready to accept vulgar things. It should have to be your parents' decision to see if you're ready or not. My final conclusion is that it depends on how mature you are and if you think you're ready. The stores and libraries should set limits on books and ages. Although some people will not agree, there should be boundaries for teenagers and age privileges, and they should respect them enough not to do them.
321	3298	2	3	Many people base their actions on their own views. What some may appear to be justified in their minds, due to their beliefs, might cause an uproar from others. One instance of this: media censorship. It happens every day, every place. Someone can take it upon them selves to ,in their mind, 'make the piece better for public viewing'. In reality, though, they are really ruining the experience of the media for everyone else and even impeading on the rights granted to us by the constitiution: Freedom of the Press. First up, books in the library. Everytime I go to the library and pick up some books, there is always one book with the 'bad parts' marked out. Someone had found these words offensive and decided that no one should have to see or read them. To me, it was irritating. I don't always like those words either, but having them marked out is distracting from the page and , for me, ruins the author's voice and style of writing, hence impairing what I draw from the book. Some marked-out words aren't always offensive to others, either. Simply put, if you find the book offensive, don't read it. Others may enjoy it, whether they share your views or not. People also take the liberty of simply removing whole pieces of media from shelves just because they find it offensive. If everyone removed anything they didn't like, or found offensive, there would be nothing left in the world for anyone to enjoy. We, as American citizens, have the right to make our own choices, and our choices should not be limited by the views of certain individuals. That means that if I want to read or view something, it should be available to me, so I may learn and expand my views, even if it makes someone else uncomfortable. With nearly every disputable form of media that comes out, people harangue the producers and say the piece should have never been made. Wrong. Producers and authors can publish whatever they would like. It's called Freedom of the Press, and it is a right garunteed to us, as United States citizens, under the Constitution. And learly, if pieces like that are being produced, people read it. Plain and simple. You might not, but maybe a neighbor, or even a relative, may not be offended by it and might read it. Supply and demand. If everyone found it offensive, no one would buy or read it, and because of that, it would no longer be produced. You would get your way. But, no. Some people do read it and it is produced. Again, if you don't like it, don't read it. People should not take it upon themselves to censor what others can and can't do, see, or read. If someone wants to read a story that has 'bad words' in it, so be it. Others should not ruin the experience by marking the words out. Not only is it rude and ruining the experience for the reader, but it is also destroying someone else's property. If someone wants to view something that is against a certain religion, so be it. They have the right and no one can take that right away from them. In my opinion, censorship in libraries, whether by government, or other civilians, should not be allowed. We citizens are allowed the right to make our own choices and in public libraries, the public should be allowed to read or watch whatever they want. Choice is one of the prinicples of the constitution, and it should be protected, not limited.
322	3299	2	3	Many libraries contain books, movies, music, and magazines that can be considered offensive. All of these libraries, however, have certain reasons to have these books. Whether those reasons are for education or for recreation, the libraries have reasons for them. So, the libraries that do have 'offensive' books, should be allowed to keep them because they are not offensive to everyone, and they could be beneficial to the reader. These books that are considered offensive to some people this month may not be offensive to others. For example, Sarah, who is from the South, comes into a library and finds a book that is all about the Civil War, and she reads that the South is full of a bunch of people who mistreated their slaves. Sarah gets a little offended by this. Then little John, who is an African American, picks up the same book and reads all about the South and how they treated their slaves. Little John thinks that the same book that Sarah hated is a great book. As shown in the example, America's people are very diverse, but what comes with that diversity is a lot of opposing views in its citizens. A library doesn't want to only appeal to one race, it wants to appeal to all of them, the only way to have that happen is to accidently offend some people in the process. The citizens of the United States need to be more understanding that their race isn't the only one here. If a book offends a person, that person simply should not read it. However, these books, who many this month find offensive, could also be beneficial to their readers. Some of these books could be helpful to the people who choose to read it. Going back to the Civil War reference, Sarah was reading her local Southern text book, and she read about the horrible deeds the South had done regarding their slaves and the fact that they lost the war to the Union, and she got offended because her side lost. Then little Timmy, who is in the same class as Sarah, was reading his history text book and was becoming more and more elated as he read on. He found out that kids all over the the country were learning about what had happened to his ancestors and that the Union defeated the South. Timmy was as happy as he could be with this book, whereas Sarah couldn't be any more displeased. If this book was pitched out of the library, how would students all over the nation learn of the Civil War? They wouldn't. Libraries cannot just throw out books because they offend someone. As Katherine Paterson said, if we all picked a pile of books that offend us and got rid of them, then there wouldn't be any books left for any of us to read because other nations would be offended by the books that appealed to one, and so on and so forth. So, libraries need to keep the books that they have and get even more books. This nation needs as many books as it can get because they are all extremely helpful to those that they appeal to. We just need to remember that not all of the books appeal to us and not to get offended by those that don't, ultimately allowing for a wider range of perspectives and knowledge to be accessible to all.
323	3300	2	3	Censorship in libraries, in my opinion is over-rated. Everywhere you hear of books, music, magazines, and movies being offensive or degrading, but does that mean that they should be taken off the shelves of our public libraries, or out of book stores? I say no because future generations need to know of the material, it might not always be offensive, and the public libraries have no right to tell us what we can, and cannot read. Some say that our future generations will be greatly shorted of knowledge, or become naive because of this lack of knowledge. I say this is because of the censorship in libraries. Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' So if they're taking books off the shelves because they find them offensive, then there will be so many books gone, that the kids will not have a broader view as so many people are lucky to have today. Everyone has a different opinion about everything, including what's offensive and what's not. If one person sees a book as being offensive, that doesn't necessarily mean that someone else will also. I've heard of teachers not letting the students see pictures of The Holocaust, because they think it's offensive. Not everyone agrees with that. The Holocaust is a big part in history and it being categorized as offensive is wrong; it's not the only thing in history that is bad. If they start taking out big parts of history, it will be long lost and forgotten. Lastly, I believe that the libraries should not be able to tell us what we can and cannot read. We have the right to choose what we want to read; if we think that it's bad and shouldn't be reading it, then we won't read it. But that doesn't mean they should take out the book because one person finds it offensive. Someone else might want to read it. I think that people are mature enough to pick what they read, and as for children, their parents are the ones that could pick for them. With so many different opinions, it's hard to decide what to do about censorship. I believe that if it's offensive, maybe they should have a special section for explicit media and reading. Maybe then people wouldn't be offended by it. Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean another wouldn't either, and restricting access based on subjective offense undermines individual choice and intellectual freedom.
324	3301	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, my name is @PERSON1 and I think that everyone has a right to there own opinion. People @MONTH1 may not want there kids to look at certain things but, they need to keep them were there kids cant find them. Kids in the world hear bad language, see fighting, and even see people get shot. There is a lot more bad things in life than a movies, books, and music that childreen listen to, watch, or read. I think that the world is more harmfull sometime than anything. Adults @MONTH1 want kids to grow up differently than others so they need to tell them not to be listening and watching the bad things on tv. But, if there kids wanna learn about things that happen thats not the greatest, then people should let them. It wouldn't be right if people or movies or things had to change just because other people dont like it. Why should other people have to change just for the ones who dont like it. There are some materials that are bad but can be only purchesed at the age of eight-teen. Thats why people should be ok with things that dont envolve minors. Having things censored ruins a lot of things; the fact that its was made that way it should be kept that way. I'm sure many people @MONTH1 may not agree with my report but, it's something to look and think about. People wouldn't make the things they do if it was supposed to be censored. That takes the whole meaning out of a lot of things. So my answer is NO about taking things away that are not censored. Keep them so people can understand life the easy way and the hard way, thus allowing them to form their own perspectives. Sincerely, @PERSON1
325	3302	2	3	I believe as a citizen of this city and as a avid library goer, that censorship in libraries is neccessary. Some of the material in the libraries @DATE1 are very graphic and sometimes quite a bit offensive. Do we really want our children looking at half-nude people or the murder of innocent people just because of their skin color? In @DATE1's libraries there are many books and movies that represent racism. Take for instance the movie '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1.' In the movie the white children get yelled at because they are playing with the @CAPS3-@CAPS4 children. This is a wonderful example of why censorship is neccessary. Just think, if your child were to watch this and then go and say something rude to one of their friends, who is @CAPS3-@CAPS4, it would be very offensive to them. Although this movie is about historical events, it still needs to be taken off the shelves, in @CAPS1 opinion. In @DATE1's society, nudity is becoming a big issue in movies and also in books. You @MONTH1 think that it is okay to let your child watch a movie rated @NUM1, but little did you know, there is nudity in it. Depending on how old your child is, and if you let them on the computer or not, they might think it is okay to go and look up nude pictures on the internet. Also, in books this is becoming an issue. It was just the other day I sat down to read a book about a musical that I wish to see, and there were nude pictures in it. Once I found this out, I asked @CAPS1 mother to please take it back. These are the sort of things that need to be taken off the shelves of our libraries. Language usage in music is also a big deal. Many rap artists think it is okay to use offensive and explicit language in their music. I do not think they take into consideration that young children will be listening to their music. This genre of music needs to be taken off the shelves. You @MONTH1 think it is okay for your young child to listen to it now, but just wait until those words make it into their vocabulary. I think that library censorship is a big deal that needs to be taken into deep consideration, as the presence of such content can be detrimental. It @MONTH1 be different at first, especially when you go in to get your favorite rap tape, or your favorite @NUM1 movie, but trust me in the long run, you will thank the library for taking it off the shelves. Especially when you get older and have children, as you will not want them listening, reading, or watching the things you watched as a child, thus making censorship in libraries a necessary action.
326	3303	2	3	I'm writing this paper today to talk about censorship of books, movies, music, etc. I think that there should only be certain things on the shelf that children can see. If you walk into a store or video store there are so many different things that children are exposed to. They see things and then seeing them makes them think that kind of stuff is appropriate. I believe that there should be a very limited selection that children can see. Things that are inappropriate should not be visible to children. I think that things that are bad should be removed from the shelves and placed somewhere else. Also, the music on the radio is censored, yes, but it doesn't mean that people don't know what the words are. There are people that get offended by certain words, and they are still on the radio, on television, in books. They are everywhere. Things would be completely different if people would watch what they put in stuff. It makes people, especially children, believe that certain things are appropriate, and they are not. We should have very strict rules on things like that, so then nothing inappropriate is shown to people, making them believe it is all appropriate. There are rules now on things like that, but it doesn't mean that underage children are still not getting to see this kind of stuff. That's why I believe there is so much violence now because children are playing video games such as Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto, and when they see shooting and stuff, they think it's appropriate, and they grow up believing that. I am writing this paper today to ask for an article in the paper on stricter rules for these kinds of things, and maybe it will start to make things such as violence less prevalent.
327	3304	2	3	How would you like to read or listen to something disrespecting and calling you out of your name such as, '@CAPS1 did you say to me @CAPS2'? I would, I think anything that was hurtful, harmful, or offensive should be open to the public because it's a great way and opportunity to learn. Books, magazines, and music on slavery are things I think we as a people are required to read and have. Sure it might hurt, depress, or even aggravate some people but it also fills you with knowledge on the past, which helps us understand its impact. For a person of any race this is a way to feel the pain and struggle of people before us. Despite the pain or irritation this is a type of learning I would welcome in libraries. Knowledge of suicide is also something I think should be available. Because some of our friends and family have either did or attempted suicide, and without knowing about it how can it be prevented? Books on the subject would provide help for those going throughout life with suicidal thoughts. Reading about past struggles or facts about it could give them tips or ideas on how to avoid suicide. I think we need literature on this because I feel enlightenment on the subject is the only way you can avoid it. In conclusion, I think that all types of literature should be admitted and released to the public, as all forms of literature offer a great opportunity to learn and understand the human condition. I believe that only by reading the literature on past situations and struggles can you avoid or overcome struggles you face or will face in your lifetime.
328	3305	2	3	Why should books or other such ideas but lets get back to the subject. Should certain books be aloud to be in a libary. Cause if u dont have certain books you would have to read the same book over and over. But there are all kinds of books that you can pick you have history,poems,dramas,love,scary. But some are not aporpit for certain places. Certain music is ok but there are some that I would not aprove of. Like there rap its a bunch of people rymes. That people think up in there heads about life. Something that they want to express by telling raping. There is rock in roll alot of people did not care for it. When it was intruduces in the late 50s but as time went on people started listening to it. But alot of people did not want there kids listening. To that back then they said it was devil music. But in this day in age alot of people still listen to rock n roll. Cause they were brought up on that kind of music. Movies there is a lot of diffent movies out there. There R and rated PG-13 but alot of partents do not let there kids. Watch certain movies because they scare there kids. They are so ugly and gross that some people cant stand it. But there are shows for kids to there like a movie but a little shorter. Magazines just are a new thing that people are trying out. But mostly old people read magazines cause they have alot of time on there hands. But there are some people who cant get ehogh of magazines. Cause they want to buy every thing in the book. It catchs there eyes bye the way it looks . But there is all kinds of diffent magazines mucle, food ,cleaning, toys. But thats what I think about this kind . Of stuff it sucks people in but some cant get out. By the time they get out they are broke, showing how easily people can get consumed by these forms of media.
329	3306	2	3	If we were to take away every thing that someone in the world finds offensive, there would be nothing left. Many people in different cultures find many different things offensive. it's not right to take away from others something becuase a select group of people take offense at it. Something being offensive isn't always a bad thing. There's many different reason why, but removing something because of someone else's opinion isn't right. First, whether you find something offensive or not, is laregly based on your culture. To most Western cultures, declining food is offensive. To Hindus, eating or hurting cows in anyway is a complete disgrace. If something is offensive to one person, it might be because they have a different background. You're never going to please everyone. Second, one of the best thing's about the United States is that you can have your own beliefs. If something was removed from the shelf at a library, because someone found it offensive, I would be disturbed. I have my own beliefs that I'm sure not everyone agrees with. Some of my beliefs would be offensive to certain people. That doesn't mean I should have to stay silent about my beliefs, does it? No, of course not. I wouldn't want anyone else's beliefs forced on me. I'm sure no one wants my beliefs forced on them. By removing things from a shlef becuase took offense at it, you'd be removing freedom of speech from the shelf also. That's not only wrong, it's illegal. Some people would be offended at a book with a cross on it. Some people would be offended by a satanic cover with a pentgram. That doesn't mean they should be taken away. It's good to get offended sometimes. It often makes people stand up for what they believe. To me, it's reminder of why I believe what I do. I might be angered by what I see. I'm sure the terrorist group ISIS is greatly offended when they see the American flag. We wouldn't stop waving it, would we? That'd be absurd! Just because someone takes offense at something doesn't make it wrong. It never has. It just means they have different beliefs. We should have the maturity to look away instead of demanding that it be removed. I personally believe that removing things from the public eye, merely because they're offensive, would be wrong for many reasons. So many people find so many thigs offensive. It'd take away everythign if we removed eac and every one. Removing offensive items would also be an intrusion of freedom of speech. Plus, many things that are offensive often remind of of who we are. We should be string enough to look away and not fight about it. I don't think they should be removed. I want my library to be what America was made to be, a mixture of cultures and backgrounds. I don't think anything should be removed unless it directly causes harm to people.
330	3307	2	3	During school one day all of our teachers told the class that most of the books in the library is going to be took off the shelves. But our class don't want that to happen. All the teachers told us that some people parents has been complaning about what there kids are reading. I thank that most the the books that are in the library is good for the kids to look at because thats what they like annd they like to learn about what would like to have or do someday. I also thank that it is a good thing that kids are wanting to learn about what they want to do later in life. Later in life when I have kids I would like them to dream about what they want to do in there life. So if that means that they want to go to school and look at magazines all day and make sure that thats what he wants to do thats fine with me. So if the teachers want the books off the shelves they can but I don't think that the kids are going to try much if they cant be what they want to be later in there life time. I know that if they did that to my kids that I know I would buy them all the magazines thay want so they can learn what they want to do in life. So if they take all the books off the shelves I know that all the kids parents are probley going to get mad because thats what messes up the kids dreams. Know when the kids what to read the schools is taking all the good books off the shelves none of the kids are going to know what they want to do in there later life. A good thing to do is to let the studends vote and see what the what to do about taking the books off the shelves. I bet most of the students in this world would say to keep them on the shelves because they like to read and look at pictures, which means they want to be something when they grow up. I hope that my kid whats to be something that he likes to do when he grows up. I will help any kid as much as I can with there dreams. There is two things that are going to happen. One is that the school is going to take the books off the shelves and the students are not doing to try in school and they might not know what they want to be, or they might just give up on it all, and I know that know one whats that to happen. The second thing is that the schools is going to keep the books on the shelves and the students are going to want to read them more. Also they will probley know want whey want to do later in there life time. If I could pick what to do I would keep the books on the shelves and make the kid happy. It's better to keep the books available so students can explore their interests and find their passions, ensuring a brighter future for everyone.
331	3308	2	3	Everyone has their own opinion on censorship in libraries. I think that what libraries choose to put on their shelves should not be censored. Every human being does not have the same taste in what they read, listen to, look at, and watch. In today’s generation everyone has their own opinion on censorship. I do not agree with censorship because not everyone likes the same things, has the same thoughts, has the same lifestyle, and wants to learn the same things. Everyone is an individual and is different in their own way. If libraries wanted to censor what they put out not everyone would get to read, listen, and watch what they wanted. Having libraries censor things would make people feel left out. For example if the library only put out romance things, then what would the action lovers do? A library is for anyone and everyone who goes to it. One specific type of person does not go to the library.  Everyone grows up in a different lifestyle. Children do not choose their parents. Some parents censor what their kids read and watch, and some do not. Kids who have parents that do not censor what they choose to get at the library might have different interests. Not everyone likes the same things.  In school most of the time everyone learns the basic information that is required. Outside of school there is so much more to learn. People can go to libraries and learn about different things that they want to learn about. What people choose to study in their free time can range from drugs and sex to science and history. If libraries censored what people can read, watch, listen to not everyone would get to learn extra information that they wanted to. Libraries can not censor their materials!  I do not agree with libraries censoring what materials they choose to put out for the public. People are different and that is okay. If libraries choose to censor things then not everyone would have equal opportunities. Parents can censor what their kids read if they want. Not every parent chooses to censor what their kids get at the library; therefore kids have different interests. Human beings do not always want to learn the same things. The libraries who choose to censor what they put out is not letting everyone have an equal chance to learn. Please let people be who they want to be! Do not censor what libraries put out such as books, music, movies, and magazines. This freedom to access diverse materials is essential for personal growth and intellectual exploration, and it is a disservice to the community to limit access based on subjective opinions.
332	3309	2	3	I beleive it is wrong to remove books from library shelves even if they are found offensive. I have three reasons to support this statement. These reasons are knowledge, different sections of the library, and freedom. I will explain these reasons below but before I begin I would like to add that most people want to censor things that they fear. If a book is removed from a shelf because someone finds it offensive then the next person who comes along looking for that book can not access it. How is that fair? In life there are many things that can offend people but thats life, you have to learn to let those things go. Everyone has a right to form their own views and oppinions on things, but they can not if they do not read other people's oppinions. Reading expands our vacabulary, at any age. Just because you do not like something does not mean someone else also can not like it. You have to give them a chance to form an oppionion. Library's are everywhere. If you are concerned about your children finding books that you do not want them to see then take them to a library with sections. All libraries are broken down in sections. Keep your children in the 'children' section and there should not be any concerns in that area. Once your children get older allow them to roam the library and develope an oppinion on what types of books they enjoy most. We live in America, which since founded has been all about freedom. Some people do not have the money to buy books, or internet, So these people rely on public libraries. If they look for books and can not find a subject that interests them they will not read. They could even be looking for a specific book and not be able to find it because it was taken off the shelf. There is also a religion conflict. There are many different versions of the Bible but, many different religions. People come from all backgrounds so if they do not beleive in the Bible do we take that off the shelves too? In closing I would like to add that I can also see why people would want to censor certain things. However most of the things people do not like to see are things they fear. These people can not hide from reality, not everything in the world is good, so let's not pretend everything is perfect and do our best to contribute to the wellness of society, and supporting access to diverse materials in libraries allows us to do just that.
333	3310	2	3	Cooling the **passion**, **fervor** and **zeal** From Book **Banning**, Censorship in public libraries would be an insult to the institution. A library, a citadel of knowledge, should not be bound by a society as to what knowledge it can convey. One point of a library, the destination of researchers, is to offer information that must be sought: for those who cannot find the information in their homes without fear, for those who cannot ask their questions without retribution, the library stands as a pillar of safety. Books are incapable of judgment.  To censor the books held in a library is to chip away at human progress. A freedom of thought and a freedom of press, present within our nation and increasing in presence around the **globe**, precludes the idea of this censorship.  If any book is subject to criticism or opposition, are not all books worthy of the same? To value one opinion or perspective less than another is to debase the entire culture from which libraries have arisen. Libraries are a communal institution, open to all views and writings. The point of bringing books together under one roof is to equate them, and give them all equal standing as literature or scholarly works.  From personal experience, censorship in the library has cost me precious time, and has stolen from me parts of my life. Growing up in a small town, where ideas of gender and sexuality were somewhat firmly set, any search for dissenting opinion was often fruitless. When I visited my school's library, as a child searching for answers about my sexuality, I found little aid. Around the library were a thousand stories of a man and woman falling in love, but never did I find a fairy tale of two princes. It was not until I left the school that I found that such books did exist in my old school library, but kept removed, off the shelves, restricted. More insulting than finding books of **LGBTQ+** issues completely unrepresented was to find that they were treated so separately.  Here lies the problem. Some people believe that if minority opinions or values are unrepresented, they will disappear. Such is the point of censorship: ignoring an issue or a life-choice to the point of extinction. But books cannot shout their values. They cannot shove information down our throats. Books must be read, we must give our consent to their knowledge. Unlike an advertisement that might accost us unawares, we must pick up a book and open it to receive its guidance.  If my library had done its job and given me the guidance I sought, I would have grown so much more easily. I would have learned not only how to express and accept myself, but I might have grown to more easily accept others as well.  In the past few years, with the effects of **World War II** **and the Holocaust** **reaching their pinnacle** reaching the newest generation, **Germany** has searched for ways to pay homage to the victims of the violence of **Nazism** and of the **Third Reich**. What the country finds, however, is that it cannot effectively memorialize the tragedies. In trying construct a monument, the government and culture find that they have little to build off of. The products of murder and book-burning have resulted in an emptiness, a void. As such, architects have created what **could** be called 'anti-monuments', commemorating a void to posterity to memorialize what was lost. One of the most powerful, to me at least, appears in the form of a negative bookshelf: a solid wall, with gaping holes in the form of book spines, ranging across the rows. Such is the knowledge lost from book-burning. We cannot even describe what is lost, for the knowledge has vanished. We must ask, what are we missing? What views, what prose, what beauty has been taking from us while we continue living, never having the chance to glimpse it?  This is the effect of library censorship. To remove a book from its natural and rightful place on a shelf is to set its words aflame. Once it is gone, it will be forgotten. To protect our posterity, to enlighten our descendants, we must work to preserve all books, any book that appears offensive, or disgusting, or brave, or new. Let the reader decide its value. Let the person in search of answers pick it up or leave it behind. Give the book a chance for it **to** have a power that is unrealized. Leave the libraries as they are, as the monuments to the preservation and progression of knowledge and wisdom.
334	3311	2	3	Have you ever wondered how libraries pick their books? Well, I know I have. There is some material out there that no one wants a little kid to get a hold of. I believe censorship should be allowed in libraries, because the censorship of books is vital for the kids of the world to live a life without books about violence, another reason is that it not only affects the lives of the children, but the social lives of everyone, and the overrated music of our generation. My reasons on this subject can be viewed in two different ways, but I would like to view it in my way. Look around, are there little children around? Well, if there is I would be looking at what they are reading or doing. The children might be reading books that are too explicit for their age. Take for example, a child that is six years old, and can do whatever he or she wants. They have no limits. So, one day the child decides I am going to check out a book at the library. The child obtains a book that is about violence and sex. What does the parent do when that child brings that book home? Nothing. The parents do nothing because they do not care about their own child. The time is now to step up to the plate, librarians. Take a stand and censor those books. This is what could happen to anyones child if there are books out their that could be harmful to anyone that picks them up. We must protect children from potentially damaging content.  Children aren't the only ones that are harmed by this deadly disease called noncensored books. Think about the conversations that go on in schools and at the work place. What are the conversations mostly about? I would take a wild guess that they are mostly about sex and violence. How do these conversations come up? Well, the only reason is uncensored books at the library. Anyone can check out a book at the library. It could be the elderly all the way down to toddlers. When I was little, my parents use to tell to go to the library and learn something. What if the library didn't have censored books, what would I be reading? Social lives are very affected by what they learn and how they learn the material. We need to ensure libraries promote healthy social development.  Lastly, why is that everyone time I turn on the radio, there is always a song that is not right for anyone to listen to. I listen to the radio station @NUM1 sometimes and all the music is mostly about violence. Guess what the libraries have some of these compact discs of these artists that are played on this radio station. At the library, there is a music section, movie section, and lastly the books. All of that material combined can create a social disaster, if the material isn't censored. I believe that censored music is the best path to go, because our world wouldn't be obsessed with violence if they have never read or learned about it. Libraries should carefully consider the impact of available media.  Why should we have to suffer anymore with uncensored books at the library? Take a chance and fight for what you believe in and vote for censored books. A library is a place to sit and enjoy the surroundings. It is not a place for violence, so quit with it, go for a safer environment. No one deserves to be offered the damaging violence of uncensored books, and music; therefore, advocating for censorship in libraries is crucial for fostering a more wholesome and secure community for everyone.
335	3312	2	3	'@CAPS1', the woman shreaked as she had just received a fierce, sharp,and quick stab in the back by her abusive husband. This is the kind of violence children read about all around the @CAPS2. To think all of the innapropriate stuff children see around the @CAPS2 in television, the internet, and even what classmates are talking about isn't enough, well you are wrong. Some of the things you read and hear about in books are totally unacceptable. This is why books, and magazines need to be censored in libraries all around the @CAPS2. In our community library in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 we have magazines, in which case these magazines are very graphic. Kid's will read these over any learning or interesting book. Many kid's draw disrespectful things in them. As to think that wasn't ignorant enough they also rip them in half and do many other dismantling things to them. One of the reasons why I feel that the @CAPS2 has so much trouble with criminal people is kids feel these days that they are allowed to draw in books and rip them in half even though they aren't their property, which allows them to think they can do whatever they want. Kids read about crazy things that aren't necessarily teaching you anything. Unless that is you want to learn about having a zombi apocalypse and zombies take over the @CAPS2. To have that in a school public library what is that teaching kid's? Absolutely nothing, but to teach them to take them home and show there little brother or sister a cuss word in the book is teaching them bad things. These are all some valid points as to censor or take out some of the leisurely reading books in the libraries, or to possibly censor some of the cussing.  The last point I will be touching on this discussion is the loss of money that some of the schools have due to damaged books and stolen property. Also to mention all of the dirty pictures kid's draw in the magazines and books. Schools lose a great deal of money just to touch that point. They would save a much needed amount of money if they didn't let those books leave the classroom or school library. Kid's wouldn't be able to draw in them or steal them or even damage them and all the money they could save and put it towards something learn fulfilling.  Well behaved children all around the @CAPS2 is what you can look forward to if you censor books and magazines all around the @CAPS2 in libraries. If you dont let them be taken out of the library how could kids possibly damage or steal or even draw in them. By not allowing kid's do do whatever they want and showing some authority lets kid's around the @CAPS2 know they need to show some respect. With all the money libraries and schools save they can put it towards something learn fulfilling, offering more educational resources and programs. By taking these points into consideration, we can work towards a more respectful and enriching learning environment for children in the @CAPS2.
336	3313	2	3	I believe that there should be a little censorship in libraries. There are some books out there that could be a little offensive and cause some problems, but I also believe that even if a book is insulting you shouldn't be able to hide it from others. There are some books that have some pretty nasty stuff in them that you could find in a library. Since a library is public, lots of people go in to get books. What is to stop a kid from getting to one of these books, or movies you can find in libraries? Do you really want a child to check something out that has violence, horrible language, and sexual innuendo? What can you do about this problem? You could censor the books and hide them from the public, but that would cause another problem.  The idea of censorship might sound ok, but really it's not the right thing to do. Hiding things from the public just because it might have some bad things in it is a little over the top. If you are an adult and you're in the mood to read something with a little violence in it you'd have to go somewhere else because someone just took that book away because it had some swear words that they don't find appropriate in books. Censorship would just make it harder for adults to find some books that they would want to read and limiting their reading options.  So what do you do if there is an offensive book on the shelf? Do you just leave it there, or take it away so no one can read it? You could just put age restrictions on the books. If someone underage wanted to check out the book, they would have to get permission from their parent. That way the book can stay on the shelf and be read by anyone who is old enough to read it, and children are protected from accessing inappropriate content.
337	3314	2	3	People all judge things differently. Thats why I feel that libraries should keep those kinds of books. What might be found as an offensive book to one person might not to another one. If there are people saying that the certain books are offensive, then they shouldn't take them out of the library. You shouldn't take one book out because one person thinks it is offensive. What might be offensive to one person might interest another. The person that doesn't think it is, should have the right to read the book. That would be taking the rights for people away because a person finds it offensive. The person might find the book useful because they want to learn about the topic more. They will never get to learn about it if they take the book out because one person finds it offensive or doesn't like it. I personally like watching movies or reading books that are thrilling and might have some violence in them. If the library took these books or movies out because a mother saw her son or daughter read or watching then it would be wrong. The mother would be taking away what I like to read and watch. Thats not fair at all. A way to solve this issue is to have certain areas for each type of age group; therefore, they would be watching or reading types of things acceptable for their age group. I understand the fact that some people take things offensively. Also that they don't want their children to pick up a book or movie that isn't acceptable for their age group. They have to understand though that sometime people like those type of things, and they are taking it away from the people who enjoy them. It is like taking rights away from people because they don't agree with what is happening. It wouldn't be right at all to take those books out of the library. All people have different views about things. You can't change a thing if one person doesn't like it. People have rights to pick up a book if they want to or not. Not everyone is the same, so not all people are going to think the same way. I like things that some people might not like, that is just how human nature is, and restricting access based on individual objections undermines the principle of intellectual freedom that libraries should uphold.
338	3315	2	3	Over time, libraries have been used as a big resource when doing reports, researching, renting movies and simply trying to find something new to read. They have been used as a gate way for an extensive world of reading and learning. All libraries should have the right to have the content they please to have on thier shelves. No book, music, movie, magazine , etc., should ever be denied a place on the shelve because of it's content.  Sex, drugs, violence. There are many books over these topics that many people might find offensive or just completely oblivious. Every mind is diffrent when it comes down to what it likes to read, watch or hear. No mind is the same, so no mind will ever like exactly the same thing. When ever someone wants to go buy a book about safe sex, it should not be denied to them because the library does not allow it. It should be placed on a different section of the library.  Many books that people find as explicit content to them, might not be to others. When i was in middle school, i heard alot about sex, and drugs. I never knew what it felt like or how did it feel. What i did know was that I could get accesible information from my local library. What happens when a child wants to know more than she does? She looks, and researches it. If i would have been denied the access to books about sex or drugs, I would have probabaly never been warned about the out comes or the seriousness of them both. When you walk into a libraby and observe. Not everyone is reading a book about rainbows, and unicorns. Many people read books about the real life, books that they can relate to. Many of those books that many people read are those that others calls explicit. The purpose of a library is to have access to books, magazines, music, and movies of all kind of content, reguardless of others concerns.  Also, Libraries can do many things so that certain contents might not be near others. They can organize there topics and genres. Explicit, or eighteen or older books, movies, magazines or music might be placed in a back room or simply on another side of the library. Far from the reach where kids and children are able to access.  In conclusion I believe with my strongly supportive ideas that books, magazines, music or movies should not be removed if found offensive because every book has a right on the shelve no matter what. No book should be removed because someone might find it offensive; if a person finds something offensive they should take it up with the author or publishers not the library, for they only let people borrow the content.
339	3316	2	3	Censorship is a topic that is strongly opinionated. If one person does not like the content of a text, that person might find themselves saying that they have the right to abstain from being able to view that text in a library, public location, or online source. But what about the other people? Shouldn't they have a say too? Let's say that 'person one' does not agree with the language in a text, but 'person two' perhaps does. Which person has the benefit in **this** situation? Freedom of speech and expression are two factors that are very valued, and perhaps sometimes even overlooked in our society. In **this** case, both 'person one' and 'person two' are allowed to have a right to say and think what they feel about the text. Should 'person one' still have the right to say that **this** text does not belong in a public location? Well, if every person had the right to remove something that they disagreed with from the public, there nothing would be left. In such a large and diverse society, there is bound to be at least one person who does not agree with the content of a certain material of each and every lyric, magazine, book, and text that there is available. Some might say that **this** is unfair to that one group who does not agree with the content of a material. But how is that fair to the other group who actually do agree with that material? Freedom of speech and expression are still not being excluded from that group who does not agree with such material. That group is still allowed to speak their opinions and takes on that particular material, as well as the people who do agree with the material. Take iTunes for example. If there is a song that has language and/or content that could be considered disrespectful to a person, there is a red tag by the song that says: 'explicit.' **This** is an indicator that a person who could find foul language offensive, that such person should not buy that song. There is also the compromise. Quite often, if a song is tagged as 'explicit', there is usually an alternative of the same song. That same song is then tagged with a gray tag that states: 'clean.' A song being 'clean' simply means that the song is still the same, but the considered to be disrespectful content is removed, or removed and replaced with different words that are not considered to be disrespectful. Both parties are now satisfied with the so called: happy-median. Take movies as another example. Movies are rated based on their content. The higher the rating, the more explicit such movie is. Along with the rating, there is an explanation as to why that movie is rated the way that it is. If you are a person who is careful about viewing things that are against your own opinions and beliefs, then by seeing the rating and explanation, such person knows that **this** material is not for them. Again, the happy-median. For every given case of a group of people who do not agree with the terms of a certain content, the alternate group must be considered as well. Both parties in **this** case are still able to say and express their own opinions. So, should **this** context be removed from the eye of the public because a certain group of people do not agree with the content in it? No. However, one must keep in mind the views and opinions that each person has on such material, and that person should still be respected for their take on that material, even if we ultimately decide against censorship to uphold broader freedoms of expression.
340	3317	2	3	I haven't personally encountered a book that was racially offensive to me or that I felt should be censored, but I did read a book with a lot of racism and sexual content. While I'm not racist, some individuals hold deeply prejudiced views. Some library books contain content unsuitable for all readers, yet access isn't always restricted. Certain books, movies, magazines, and other media might warrant reconsideration for removal to shield certain audiences.  Libraries often house books containing racist content. Some instances of racism in these books can be extreme, potentially intriguing young readers and leading them down a harmful path. This could result in them influencing their friends, promoting racist ideologies. Most parents wouldn't want their children to become racist, though some families do hold such beliefs, which is hard to understand since we are all the same.  Sexually explicit content is also present in some library books. Detailed descriptions can be inappropriate for young readers, potentially leading them to experiment prematurely. While such exploration is acceptable at an older age, exposing young children to such content is wrong, and many parents would object to their children reading such books. I know I wouldn't let my child read a book like that.  Music, a universal form of expression, also faces scrutiny. Some find rap music offensive and advocate for its removal. However, rap often reflects personal experiences and struggles. It can contain racist language and unsuitable content for young audiences.  Given the presence of potentially harmful content, such as racism and explicit material, perhaps these materials should be housed in a separate area accessible only to older individuals. While books with racism should still be available to show the past, this could protect younger readers from exposure. By segregating these materials, we could still provide access to these materials while safeguarding younger, more impressionable minds.
341	3318	2	3	New Section in the Local Library!  Have you ever seen a movie or read a book that you did not want your kids/family to read? I know I have, and sometimes there is no stopping them from seeing or reading those books/movies. I don't necessarily think the offensive books should be removed, but I think they should be relocated to a different part of the library. This section of the library should only be entered by an adult, or with an adults permission.  Little kids see stuff that their peers are doing and want to be just like them so they do the same stuff. What the kids don't realize is that most of it is fake, and the things that happen in movies aren't really true. By having this seperated section of the library, it gives parents the chance to get the racist, drug/gang filled, and murder books away from the children. This will be good for every race too! If an african american family does not want there child to be reading books about slavery or gangs, they can keep them out of the section of books where slavery and gangs are. Some books are really emotional and can trigger a persons emotions. If someone is going through a really hard time and they read a book about suicide, they are more likely to think about killing themself.  I think by separating the bad influencing books from the good influencing books it well help alot. People under the age of 16 are not permitted to be in this section of the library without a parent, or parent signature. So come on down to the Local council on June 1st and vote for the new section of the library! Thank you for your time, and I hope this new section will help protect our youth from harmful content and promote healthier reading choices.
342	3319	2	3	"Censorship in libraries would be like cutting off the world's air supply. It would be taking away from a reader's imagination, stopping readers from being able to express their minds. My view on censorship in libraries is that it is not needed. Libraries around the world do a good job of keeping certain books in the appropriate age levels. Removing materials from libraries would cause readers to question why they are being removed. Then, readers would demand that we leave their books alone and fight for more books like those, creating a greater need for censorship.  Books were made to keep people wondering, learning, and excited. Cutting away different materials would stop people from enjoying the world of minds. The more books you take away, the higher the population watching television gets. Then, there would be fewer authors and more actors and actresses. People's minds would not be wondering, learning, or being kept excited.  I remember when I was a little girl, I went to the library. I was looking for a book and went to the ""big kids' side,"" as I called it, and tried to check a book out. The librarian told me I was too young and showed me to my age-level books and took the other book back. Then I was able to check a book out.  So, all I am saying is that censorship is not needed in libraries, because that would be taking away from a librarian's job and ultimately stifling a reader's imagination; age-appropriate placement already provides sufficient guidance."
343	3320	2	3	There is a certain amount of responsibility when it comes to censoring all the different types of media and literature. Deciding whose responsibility that is can be a difficult task. Children can be strongly influenced by all media out there and that material has been made easily accessible. When someone comes of age to make decisions that affect their life then they should be able to. Shop owners should be able to sell whatever they want in order to make a living. When children go to a library usually they will not do so alone. Parents can decide what their child is allowed to take home or not. When a child comes to their parent with a book, movie, or magazine that is offensive or inappropriate it comes to the parent to decide whether or not they want their child to be exposed to that material. If the parent allowed for their child to have access to offensive media then that can give the child the idea that what they are looking at or reading is alright. It is the parent's role to guide their child and instill values.  If someone has come of age and has all the other freedoms that everyone else has they should be allowed to buy, read, and watch what they want. To prove to someone that you are of age to have access to offensive material you should have to show some sort of identification proving it. A driver's license or other government-issued ID would suffice.  A shop owner or businessman/woman should be able to sell whatever he or she wants to in order to make a living as long as it stays within the boundaries of the law. Having someone who does not work in the law or a person who is not a legal guardian or parent of someone who is not of age should not tell someone not to buy, read, or watch something just because it might be offensive or offend that one person. This respects individual liberty and free markets.  I conclude that in order for someone to tell another person not to buy or rent material that person would either have to be law enforcement or their legal guardian as long as they are not of age. There is no reason why people should not be able to access material that is not against the law. If someone is offended by some literature then they should try to make it against the law, although efforts to restrict access should be carefully considered to avoid infringing on the rights of others.
344	3321	2	3	Censorship, that's a word that causes a lot of arguments in today's society. People have extremely different views on censorship throughout the world. In some countries, dictators don't allow their citizens to have internet access, watch the news, or in some more extreme cases, even watch television at all. The majority of the time they do this because they don't want the citizens of their country to know what is happening around the world. This sets up a 'fish bowl' environment, meaning that people from other countries see all of the issues in that country, but the people actually in the country have no idea what's going on around them.  Although we don't always see censorship in that extreme of a sense, it still plays a large part in today's society. Everything from music on the radio to military files are censored. Think about it, how often can you listen to a song on the radio that all of the original words are still intact? Arguments over censorship have gone back and forth for years without really making much progress at all. Each side of the argument, whether it's for or against censorship, is almost entirely opinionative. No one can say for sure that censorship is completely needed or not. It's just too hard to determine who's opinion is really more convincing.  In my opinion, I don't think anything should be censored. If the writer of a TV show throws in a vulgar word, most likely it's for the effect that it has on people to show emotion. The same thing goes for songs, when an artist writes the lyrics to a song, they are trying to convey a message and they use certain words that get their point across more effectively or more dramatically. Parents argue that their children are seeing too much violence on TV and are causing behavior problems along with other things, and that shows need to be more suited for children. There is an alternative to censoring all of these things, rather than 'ruining' everyone's fun just don't let your kids watch that show.  In the USA today, we have something called freedom, we exercise this right everyday with what we wear, and what we say. I think that we should take that freedom and apply it to censorship. Instead of complaining about violence in movies and sex on TV, you can make a decision simply to not watch that kind of show. Everyone has the option to say NO; if you don't want to hear or see something simply choose something else to watch, or even just do something entirely different. You don't have to do anything that you don't want to do. It's is an easy solution, all you have to do is exercise a right that you have had since the day you were born and just say no, I don't want to do that. It's very simple and could potentially stop all debates on whether or not things need to be censored. Therefore, by taking personal responsibility and making individual choices, we can navigate the complexities of content consumption without resorting to broad censorship, ultimately preserving freedom of expression while protecting individual values.
345	3322	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON1, Should certain books be removed because some people @MONTH1 think they are inappropriate for their children to see or read? No, I do not think they should be removed. I honestly think all they all should be put in different sections of the library by age. Like all the children books and magizenes should be in one section. The younge adult and or teen books and magizenes should be in a section by its self. Then the adult books and magizenes should be in their own section. Even the autobiographys and documentories should be in their own section too. It would make things easier to find the book you are wanting to read. For example, if your a teenage girl looking for a book about a high school girl with a crush on a boy, it'd most likely be in the section for the younge adults. So yes, the parents that are concerned about their children's viewing of certain books should be able to say something about it. But what if one teenager is looking for a book about a famous person's autobiography for a school project, even though it includes how they used to be into drugs as a teenager? That person shouldn't have to fail if they can't find it in a library because some concerned parent didn't think it was appropriate. Like I said the best thing to do is put all the books in subcatagories by age, since it would make things way easier and faster to find the book of your selection, ultimately providing access to diverse materials while respecting parental concerns through organization.
346	3323	2	3	It seems as if inappropriate materials are found everywhere in today's world. In magazines, in books, in the lyrics of music, the possibilities of where to sneak in offensive references are endless, and they certainly pop up everywhere these days. But should your resources of where you find these materials be limited due to other people's morals or values? I disagree with this act, and I would like to tell you why I do. All of us have different morals, values, and senses of what is right and what is wrong; everyone's are different. Maybe it's your religion or culture that keep you from these materials. But why should your values and beliefs dictate what another person can or cannot get from their library? I know I don't just speak for myself when I say I would be very annoyed if I couldn't get the books or materials I wanted or needed just because the person next to me doesn't agree with what is being found through researching it. I do believe certain things should be separated from other parts of the libraries. For example, books that would be found offensive to children should be kept away from where children can pick out things in a library. That is completely understandable. But when things are being removed because certain people don't agree with them or find them offensive, that is when things are going too far. This nation was built on the grounds of freedom for what you believe in. So why should we force others to believe something we think? Just because I find something offensive, doesn't mean the person next to me does, which is completely fine with me. That is his or her own personal opinion, and what I believe should not keep him or her from learning about the things they would like to. One way to fix this problem would be to separate things that could possibly be found offensive into another section of the library and to put out a sign or paper saying what exactly can be found in that section, alerting readers to the potentially sensitive nature of the content. In conclusion, no, I do not think libraries should be censored. I know I could walk into my local library and find things I found offensive right now, but I would not want my own opinion to affect someone else's viewing of that material. People should think about one another once in a while and not be so stuck on what they personally believe. The world is an opinionated place, if it were not we would have nothing. A library can be filled with useful materials, so the focus should be on what you can find in a library to help you, not on what is in the library that you do not want to see. If you find something offensive, simply stay away from it, but don't try to take it away from the rest of the world, because everyone deserves the opportunity to learn and form their own opinions.
347	3324	2	3	Libraries should have censorship because young kids could come and open and look at inappropriate material. I think we should have it because it would make sure the kids won't look at them. There are three reasons why they should have censorship. First they can teach kids bad things, second bad influence, and third they just don't need to be there. First was they can teach kids bad thing. That is because they would start looking at it more and could misinterpret the content. Then they would get in trouble. There is really no reason for them to be looking at it at all. Second, it's a bad influence. They go and tell and show there friends and make them start doing stuff that isn't right. Making them do stuff and then have a bad future. Third there really isn't no reason they should be looking at it. Like unless it fell from a book case and was laying on the floor. But there really isn't no reason they should be looking at it, especially when there are plenty of age-appropriate books available. I think we should have it so it can't hurt and kids so everyone would be right in life. Ultimately, censoring inappropriate material in libraries can help protect children from potentially harmful content, ensuring a safer and more positive environment for everyone.
348	3325	2	3	I think that censorship in libraries isn't needed. The grounds that are basing the censorship are very opinionated and biased ones. Two readers of one book could view the material completely differently. The reader has chosen to read that book and thus more than likely knows what the general plot is before they read the first page because of the summary on the back. People can make their own decisions, and can therefore choose whether or not to read the book to begin with. The books that would be found inappropriate or offensive would most likely be in teen novels or adult literature. If this is the case, they should be mature enough to handle stumbling across the material, and or making the decision to put the book back and to not continue reading. Saying that the material is unsuitable for a younger age group is correct, but at that age the children should be with AN adult when checking out books anyway. The material that people find unacceptable would almost certainly be in a novel that is intended for a mature audience, so if it is being read by a younger age group that would be the problem in and of itself. The teens and or adults whom would be reading such material are surely old enough to handle reading a few foul words and scattered innuendos throughout the plot. The material that COULD be found inappropriate or offensive COULD be viewed differently given two different audiences. A teen in high school has probably heard worse in the halls during passing; AN adult that is worrying about what their children read has certainly been exposed to enough throughout their lifetime to either look past the text or to put it away. The material being called offensive just because of one person's views is not right. The tough situations and our surroundings are what prepare us for our futures. A person seeing the bad in life would be more likely to do all in their power to make good of their futures and be more willing to help make sure it could be prevented. Should the foul things in life be ignored? Should the child that is being beaten at home have to suffer in silence because it seems too graphic to tell? The man who became homeless, only to turn his life around because he learned from his past, should that story not be told only because the troubles he had to face seem too disturbing? I believe that these are the stories that need to be told the most, in AN attempt to teach those around us how to prevent, and how to move past the troubles in life. There will always be things that we wish not to see in life. But is it not our actions that follow seeing such misfortunes that determine who we are. The libraries should not be put on a censorship, but open to the public that wish to dive into these stories. Books are written for a purpose, and that purpose COULD just be to let people know that these things are happening, and if one thinks they are alone in these strifes that they are not. Therefore, libraries should remain uncensored so that people can access diverse perspectives and learn from the stories of others.
349	3326	2	3	I believe that indeed certain books should not be on libraries' shelves. And some people feel the need to remove books of their choosing but, I also say that if the library sees it fit to put such books on their shelves that is their problem. I believe that if you do not like the books then stay away from them. Now if the books are only meant to be seen by adult eyes then, yes by all means remove them. I personally know parents that would not allow their children to read a book just because in the review they read the main characters kissed. I find it ridiculous, but that is the way they parent their kids. And as long as they don't take it upon themselves to force their parenting methods onto libraries and other learning places just because of the books I am fine with it. I find that some people see books on slavery and the Holocaust and such topics to be offensive. I see those books as our history, those topics are taught to us in school and we will most likely hear about such things as we grow up. What is the difference between learning about them now and learning about them as an adult? People seem to be trying to shield the world from things like swear words. Why? If a book has a few curse words oh well, tell your kids to stay away from it if you think it's bad. But, do not take it upon yourself to remove that book from our library. People have different views, we always have and we always will. If a parent feels so strongly about a few books get a position and get signatures saying that these books should be removed or at least moved to a different part of the library, showcasing a democratic approach. Do not force your thoughts on someone else. Ultimately, respecting diverse perspectives and promoting open access to information, while also considering age appropriateness, is key to navigating these complex issues.
350	3327	2	3	BOOKSDear @PERSON1,@CAPS1 @CAPS2, I'm starting to tell you about books in libraries that some adults find offensive for kids. These books should be taken away so kids won't read them, and adults should protest so the libraries could get those magazines away. @CAPS4, do libraries get these books and let kids take them so they can read them? The first example @CAPS2 gives is finding books and other things that are offensive for kids. Libraries are letting kids read them without an I.D. because they are in adult reading sections. These books need to be put away so kids won't read offensive things or try to do them. There should be pbs books so underage children could read, and parents don't have to worry about what their kids are reading in their free time. The second example is parents should protest so books or other things could be gotten rid of. Parents need to protest anything they find offensive so it gets off the shelves. Or they will have to make a list of what books are offensive and only let adults read them by having an I.D., which could sound a little better so books don't get rid of the books entirely. Finally, @CAPS4, do libraries let kids take these books home to read them? They should focus on what kids need to read, like educational books for school or other things. Adults need to see what their kids read these days. Kids need to understand what books are good for them from their age; otherwise, their brains will start confusing them. In conclusion, libraries need to come up with a solution so children don't read these kinds of books that will only mess up their brains, and then their parents will need to pay for their children to take therapy. So please, libraries, do something so parents don't need to worry about what their kids read these days. Like for me, I wouldn't want my kid reading offensive things because they will start doing the same things, so libraries do something about these offensive things so kids can grow and learn in a safe environment.
351	3328	2	3	"In my opinion, I think that censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries. I think that people are smart enough to make their own decisions on what they want to read. There are a few reasons why I think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries or out in public. The first reason why I think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries is because it's showing disobedience to the idea of free access to information. The second reason I think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries is because many people will overuse their authority, and it'll make many people have a bad review for that library. The last reason why I think censorship should not be allowed in libraries is that it'll change the whole environment of a library. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because it shows a form of disobedience. I think that many people will use profanity and will have an ""I don't care"" attitude. If people use profanity at home, I'm a strong believer in leaving it at home and not bringing it out in public. Censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else in my opinion, because personal expression should be managed individually. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because many people will overuse their authority, and most people wouldn't want to come back to the library. Some people overuse their authority by being loud in the libraries, preventing others from reading or doing something to occupy themselves. If a library is loud and obnoxious, it'll drive people away from the library. I think that a library should be a nice, quiet, welcoming place. That'll make the library much flow by easier. At the end of the day, I think that censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else public. A library is a place to go read, study, complete homework assignments, etc. And finally, I think that people should be able to make decisions on their own rather they want to read a book with censorship or anything to do with censorship as long as they can control it; ultimately, personal responsibility is key to navigating diverse content."
352	3329	2	3	I do believe that certain stuff should be removed from the libraries, like stuff that little kids should not be able to see. They should be in another room where you have to have ID to get in. They should make sure about this, because you don't want your little son looking at, like, Playboy. I know I don't. Little kids should not be reading books with a lot of swearing and everything, because no kid needs to act like that. If it bothers them, they could get in trouble with school and at home. Yes, it may be true that adults like to read about sex and drugs, but do we really want our kids reading the same stuff that we read? Some people just need to think about what they are leaving out in the libraries, because little kids love to see new stuff all the time. So, next time you are working at the library or just visiting there, you might want to watch where you put stuff, because little kids will see it. Therefore, careful consideration of the placement of potentially inappropriate materials is essential to protect young children from exposure to content that is not suitable for their age.
353	3330	2	3	Eventually, everyone sees or hears offensive things. However, the government has taken it upon themselves to try and keep youth from seeing it. They believe the parents should tell their children about everything while they try to make it one big secret for kids. But, if kids are introduced early, we would not have to keep it a secret anymore. Libraries and all types of media should not be censored. Kids always ask questions like 'where do babies come from?' and adults, wanting to avoid an awkward conversation, make up stories or do not tell them the whole truth. Avoiding these topics only fuels curiosity.  Imagine a world where the government let the media say whatever they want. Yes, at first it would be vulgar, and some would be uncomfortable. However, the government would then have the right to teach about sex and drugs in school. More kids would be educated, so less of them would be curious enough to do any of that stuff.  That is not to say that newscasters should curse everytime they are on television. It is merely suggesting that instead of having a metaphorical black curtain over half the news, they report the whole truth. They have freedom of speech, and we have a right to know. The media should strive for responsible reporting, even when discussing sensitive subjects.  At first, people would think it was a terrible world. But, eventually, with right leadership and a commitment to education, it would help make a more truthful environment. Kids would learn about sex and drugs in school, and have a safe environment to answer their questions if they have any. Drug use and rape would go down as open discussion reduces stigma and promotes understanding. Then, talking about 'offensive' topics would be non-existent so kids would not be embarassed if they had questions. This open and honest approach would foster a more informed and responsible society, ultimately changing the world for the better.
354	3331	2	3	The library is known to be a place full of dreams and imagination. For some, the library is a sanction where you can escape reality and dive into a book where anything is possible. The library is full of many books for all ages. Therefore, books that are classified for one age group, may not be appropriate for another age group. This is where a problem occurs. If the library chooses to keep books in it that are only appropriate for certain ages groups, various problems can occur. The three main issues with this situation are young children can access magazines they have no business looking at, some articles or books can be found offensive to some races creating an uproar, and also events and instances played out in books may not be appropriate for all age groups. We have to think about books we have read, and contemplate if we would want others to read it as well. Young children are often daily visitors of the library. Most run around the library getting into any and all books or magazines the happen to come across. This is not always good. In the library there are many magazines that are meant for adult eyes only. My family has had an experience with this sort of situation before. My mother, brother, and myself visited the library one evening. While my mother and I searched the library chaotically, my younger brother found himself, searching the magazine rack for something to keep his mind occupied. Well his mission was accomplished. On his search my younger brother had found himself a sports illustrated magazine. Inside there were pictures revealed that my mother was not too happy about my brother seeing. Instances like this happen everyday in the local library. Staff members should think to put revealing works up to where the younger generation can not find them. Throughout the library, there are many books dealing with past historic events. Although many find these books helpful and interesting, some find these books to be quite offensive. Some races have undergone painful events in history. Many of those people do not want to relive the painful past experiences. It is in my opinion that the library should oblige by the people, and take in reference how different people feel about certain books. When I was a young girl in elementary school, I remember doing a whole unit on slavery and the underground railroad. While studying the unit, we were assigned a research assignment over the lesson. I chose to visit the library in search for books I could use to gather more information. While searching the library, I came across a book that my mother and I felt should not of been where younger people could see. The book enclosed many horrible acts against black people. This is a book that at my age, I should of never came across. For me reading books helps me escape the real world and catch a break. When I relax and enjoy a good book, I can't help but feel like nothing in the world can touch me. Although I love reading books, I don't like when I come begin reading a book then have to halt because the book reveals events that I shouldn't be reading. One book I read, was definitely not appropriate for me. Although I found the book, in the young adult section, the book I read revealed a young girl encountering many rapes and beatings. Now that I look back, that is a book that I might enjoy now, 10 years later, but I don't feel I should have encountered that book then. What books should and shouldn't be encountered in the library is surely a never ending feud. Many believe that books should be taken out if they are not appropriate for all audiences. I think that if the inappropriate books that should not be viewed by all ages, were put away to where the younger audience couldn't get them, then the never ending feud might be able to be put to rest. It is crucial for libraries to consider age-appropriateness and sensitivity when managing their collections, striking a balance between intellectual freedom and protecting vulnerable readers.
355	3332	2	3	No, I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive, but that is my opinion. It is pointless to remove them from the shelves because children are going to see that kind of material outside of school, so why should we remove it? Music, movies, magazines, and books all have material such as racism, murders, inappropriate language, etc. When we find materials like those listed before offensive outside of school, we stay away from them. We ignore it and watch or read something that we do not find offensive. Movies and books about historical events and controversial figures are sometimes found offensive to some people, and if we remove them from our libraries, then we cannot have references for when we write essays over those topics. It would be hard to get the right kind of information off the internet because not everything is correct there, whereas factual books are correct. You will have no worries then. Therefore, I do not believe that certain materials that are found offensive to some people should be removed, as it is a pointless task. Children see it outside of school and stay away from it then, so they can stay away from it in school also, showing that censorship is not the answer.
356	3333	2	3	Censorship in Libraries I think that things found in the library that people find offensive shouldn't be removed. Just because some people think it's offensive doesn't mean all people think it's offensive. Some people may even like the content it shows.  I think that things in a library shouldn't be removed because everyone has their own point of view and different interests. If something was removed every time someone complained, then there would be no library left. A library is supposed to be a variety of books for all. It is not supposed to be just one genre that only one person likes.  It is important to offer a lot of variety because if a library doesn't have a lot of variety, then the library would lose all kinds of customers and their support. A library doesn't want to target just kids or teens through adults; it wants to target all aspects of people and cater to a wide audience. Even if it means that some content is inappropriate to certain individuals, it is still important to maintain a diverse collection. All books can be seen as inappropriate if you look at them in the wrong way.  I think that things found in the library that people find offensive shouldn't be removed. Everyone has their own point of view, and these viewpoints should be respected. A library should have a variety of books, not just one genre a person wants; ultimately, a library should aim to offer something for everyone in the community.
357	3334	2	3	Have you ever been in a library and thought to yourself, 'hey, this book looks pretty good.' But once you read IT, you deemed IT as inappropriate for younger people? I have, but unlike some people, I don't blame IT on the libraries. I blame myself for picking IT up in the first place. Some people do not want to take the responsibility for their actions, and so they blame IT on the library for carrying a certain author's books, a band's songs, or a magazine's articles. This brings me to say that books, music, magazines, newspapers, etc. should not be taken off of the shelves of libraries. Just because some people do not like the content that they hold, doesn't mean that IT can't be helpful or entertaining to others. I think IT should be a matter of choice, like choosing which outfit you want to wear in the morning. There are too many options, like when IT comes to the books, movies, music, and magazines. If something strikes you as inappropriate, then simply take IT back and exchange IT for something better. One experience I can think of that is a good example of this is when I was 10 years old. My mother took me into the library and I found a book, 'A Child Called IT.' I showed IT to her just like any other time we had gone to the library. Only this time, she did not want me to check IT out. She saw IT as too harsh of a book for me to read at the time, she wanted me to wait until I was older. IT was about child abuse and she saw IT as a very inappropriate book for my age, at the time. But she didn't blame IT on the libraries, asking why they would carry such books where children could reach them. Other mothers and fathers are the same way, as I found out. My best friend's parents had been the same way with her. Only instead of a book, IT was a music cd that she had wanted to listen to. They thought that she should not listen to IT because the lyrics in the songs were too 'sad' for her to hear. They agreed that if she were just a little older then she could of borrowed IT. They did not blame the library. If someone else wanted to listen to IT, or have their children listen to IT, then IT was their own personal choice. I do not believe that libraries should have censorships. They can have different sections, such as adult, children, and young adult. But I believe that they should not have to take books, music, magazines, etc. off the shelves just because of certain people. IT should be a person's personal choice. If they do not like the item that they picked up, they should take responsibility for their actions, and not blame others for their mistakes, allowing libraries to continue offering diverse materials.
358	3335	2	3	I think books, movies, music, and magazines that are offensive should not be pulled from the shelves. If you find something offensive then don't pick it up, it's that simple. It might be offensive to you this month, but it might not be to someone else. It is all according to your own personal opinion. Sure, there are some things that are very offensive to certain people, and those people will try to put a stop to it. But I think that is wrong. Because it might be offensive to you but what if there is someone studying that topic but can't find the information on it because you thought it was offensive and got it pulled off of the shelf. Then it disrupts that person's study and their access to information. I am not promoting violent books and movies or other offensive material; all I'm saying is if you find something offensive then turn the other cheek. It might be offensive to you but other people might not think the same way. There are many books and movies out there that are offensive to many people. And if we were to take all of those movies and books off of the shelf then there would be very few subjects and titles to read and watch. In my conclusion, I support the fact that offensive material should stay on the shelves. It could be helpful to many people and at the same time it can be offensive to a lot of people. But if you are one of those people that find something offensive then don't pay any attention to it and find another subject or topic. For someone to take another person's right to read a book or watch a movie is wrong; everyone has their own opinions and rights.
359	3336	2	3	"Some books should remain in libraries, free from censorship, as past experiences show it can diminish a book's impact. For example, in the book @CAPS1 @NUM1, the burning of books leads to societal collapse. Censorship sometimes stems from individuals of diverse ethnic backgrounds concerned about children's exposure to inappropriate language. Recently, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 has faced censorship, primarily due to the word ""nigar,"" deemed offensive by some, leading committees to consider its removal from school shelves. I believe censorship is unwarranted simply because parents wish to shield their children from certain words at school, as these children will inevitably encounter them elsewhere, perhaps even from their parents or television. Committees should reconsider their censorship efforts, recognizing that they cannot control adult language around children and young adults, so it is better to allow for exposure in a learning environment."
360	3337	2	3	Katherine Paterson, a well-known author, presents an idea with which I strongly agree. She states, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf left for any of us.' If everyone has the right to remove certain books that they find inappropriate, there **would** not be anything left for people to read. Although it is a good thing for parents to have a voice and stand up for what they believe, books should not be banned. Many people have different views on what is right and wrong. Some **might** suggest that a certain book is obscene, while others **may** be offended by a different book. If every parent had the right to get a book banned, there **would** come a time when no books meet the approval of the parent. Some of these books present great learning opportunities to students. Books often allow students to think in different, new ways. They can learn from a new point of view and broaden their understanding of the world. Often times, a student can look at his or her own morals and values, which is a good thing, and reflect on their own beliefs. If a teacher finds a book which they think is appropriate, parents should respect the decision of this teacher. They **can** suggest another reading, or offer other ideas, but to go as far as getting the book completely removed is not right. While removing books for reading **may** be going to far, things such as movies could go the other direction. Personally, my parents would be horrified to see grotesque, inappropriate movies set out in broad daylight where everyone can look at them. I think that this difference between books and movies is a simple thing: Books do not normally have an inappropriate cover, while bad movies often do. Because of this, even the people who do not wish to view the movie are often forced to see images which they find disturbing. If one was to walk past a book they did not intend to read, they do not have to be apalled at the cover as they pass. Although parents care about the things their children read, books should not be banned. Although other things **may** have affects on youth, books are a different story. They allow one's self to dive deep into thought, to make observations, and to form opinions. They are a key to growing, learning, and discovering; therefore, protecting access to a wide range of books is essential for fostering intellectual development.
361	3338	2	3	I do like censorship laws to an extent. However, the government cannot ban everything that they deem inappropriate. I think it depends more on what the family deems inappropriate. I do not think they should have any completely inaccessible areas in libraries for children of younger ages, because this limits exposure to a variety of ideas. I believe that the viewer should have a family member's consent to view said content. I also believe that if the content is not relative to the viewers interests, then they should just not look at it. They are not required to look at it so if they do not like it, then they do not look at it.  However, if the library does not consent to holding the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., then they do not have to and the viewer can go somewhere else, as the library has the right to curate its collection based on its mission and community needs. And if they do have the books, music, etc., then they can put limits and ratings on them. But I do not think that an adult could go in and complain about inappropriate material. As I said before, if they do not like it, then they are not required to look at it.  I actually think that the government should not tolerate parents whining and complaining about the content of different materials. One parent should not have the ability to take away others' privileges to books, because they deem it inappropriate. Just because they do not like the content, does not exclude all others from enjoying it.  Also, if a library does have an age restriction on certain materials, then appropriate acts of discipline should be taken for the viewer of said materials. However, if the viewer has an adult family member with them and has their consent, then I think they should be able to view the material, regardless of ratings, as parental guidance should be prioritized. Ultimately, a balance must be struck that respects both individual freedom and community values regarding access to library materials.
362	3339	2	3	There are so many books and magazines, music, and movies to be discovered in this world. Some are funny, sad, weird, scary, etc. And then there are some that are questionable to others on whether it was even necessary to even put the material on the shelf of a library in the first place. I for one am not one of those people who would question a book, magazine, movie or music. I believe that everyone's voice needs to be heard somehow and if we all take a voice away that we do not like, then we will lose a lot of voices. We are all entitled to our own opinion. When it comes to some things some are more opinionated than others, but in the end we all have something that we feel strongly about. There are some people who want to express their feelings with the whole world with people that understand and agree with what they feel. If we take that away from people, then how will we all connect? Some things may come across as offensive to others, but who has the right to say that something should not be shared with the rest of the world? I have observed that when people have the same interests in things like music, books, or movies then it gives people a way to come together and talk about something. I have witnessed at concerts everybody seems to connect because we are all there for the same reason, to see the band or person that we all like to listen to. Everybody's different and likes to have their own personal preference on something. Like Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think she was trying to say that if we all take a book off the shelf that we do not think should be on there, then there is going to be nothing left for anybody to read. Then what will we do? There's such a variety of materials that are needed to be discovered whether it is a book, music, or movie everyone has their own special type that they enjoy. I do not think that censorship is a good idea for any sort of material on a shelf. These materials are what keep people connected with each other, and by embracing diverse voices, we foster understanding and growth within our communities. I think it is very important to not censor anything because it does not just give the writer a voice, it give a voice for the people that agree with the material of the book, movie, or music.
363	3340	2	3	There are many books, movies, and music in the libraries. These things can come in so many varieties. Have you ever been to a library and not found something you liked? Well most people find a lot of things that interest them in many ways. Many people come to a library a day to check out something they will enjoy and have a good time listening, reading, or watching. So many people are different and each person likes something different from one another. So the question is, 'Should we remove some books, music, and movies off the shelves because they're offensive?' From experience, yes there are things at a library that children or younger teenagers should not read, hear, or see. Though that most libraries split a lot of their sections up by ages. Depending on your age you should go to the sections that mostly provide the thing you want. Do not go to a place that provides something that is not your age group, instead go to the place that looks like you belong. I personally have seen younger teens or children get a book or magazine that was not their age group, but **that** children wanted to look up on that thing. You have to understand that most younger teens and children are curious about many things before they even get to that age. As a parent or legal guardian, most children look up to you. **If** you read, listen, or watch something that is not to their age level, but the child wants to be just like you. Children look up to their parents or legal guardian. They want to **try and** do the same thing you do, so they copy you. They will find something that is similar to what you doing. They might go find a book, movie, or CD that is not their age group. They will do this all because **that** they want to be just like there parents or guardian. So as a parent or guardian you have to watch what you do also and try to set good examples to you children so they do not find offensive books or etc.. There are so many reason why people might think some things are offensive. Even though we are the reason why books and other things are brought into libraries today. Children today are growing up a lot faster then we want them to, but sometimes we cannot stop that. Just set good examples to children or any person not to get a book, movie, or music that is not there age group. Libraries can be a fun and learning environment for everyone. Just sometimes we all do not think alike or like the same stuff. There are just to many people in this world and I have read articles about libraries. I have read why libraries might not be a family place anymore all because of the varieties they carry. Have you ever thought though, **that** its use humans that makes the libraries carry these varieties?' I think so, because we are what makes up a library. We the people are the ones that want these books, movies, magazines, and music. So think about it next time you walk into a library and you see something that you **do** not think is right. Think about how **that** someone **else** really likes that. We all need to accept things if we like it or not at times, and by setting good examples, we can help guide people toward more appropriate choices. Libraries can be a welcoming and diverse place for everyone if we make an effort to understand and respect the different tastes and interests of others.
364	3341	2	3	Libraries should have whatever they want in the library. Everyone has their own thoughts on things. If you don't like what they have on their shelves then don't go there anymore or pick up something you like. Everyone is different so you can't just take offensive stuff off the shelves, it might be offensive to one person, but not to someone else. Materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, you can't just start taking stuff off the shelves just because they are offensive to you. The only way I would say take books or magazines off the shelves is if the facts are not right and misleading to the people reading them. Libraries hold almost anything anybody needs: materials, books, music, movies, magazines and everything for facts. So don't start taking stuff off your shelves. Teenagers might have to write a paper about something that people think is offensive, if you don't have everything in the library then we won't have good facts for them to use. No one in this world agrees on anything, all you would be doing would be picking a fight if you are taking off offensive materials. Libraries are open to anyone that wants to read about almost anything they want to read about. Music, everybody has their own type of music, you can't just start taking music off because you think it's offensive. Most people have their own type of everything. Children are their own person, you can keep them from whatever you want to, the thing is you can't hold them back in life. They get older you won't be able to tell them what to do or what not to do. If you keep them from a book or etc. they might end up reading it in the long run. Keeping your kids safe is important; I understand your kids are going to experience things you don't want them to. Just by taking offensive stuff off the shelves doesn't mean your kids won't find them somewhere else. I could understand if the books or magazines were offensive to you because it was about your family, but most of the time you are going to have offensive things come up in your life. That means you are going to have to not let it get under your skin or get over it. Things get under people's skin too easily. This is why the world don't get along. If you don't like something don't be around it. Find something else to read about. That's what I do if I don't like something, and this approach allows for individual choice and avoids unnecessary censorship.
365	3342	2	3	Libraries provide us with knowledge, entertainment, and peace. You can go there to learn and to do research if you have to write a paper. You can rent movies, music, and books at your pleasure as long as you take care of them. Also, if you're just having a hectic day and need some peace and quiet, libraries become a perfect get away. But, heres the truth. Many people find certain things in libraries to be offensive and would rather them not be on the shevles. So, do we remove these things or let them stay? My opinion is to let them stay. I believe that books are too important to throw out just because they might contain a few vulgar words or images. It's the same with magazines and movies. Also, music is changing as the years go on and many people, especially elders, don't enjoy listening to this new style of music. Just because one person my find something offensive, doesn't mean everyone else will. People have many different views when it comes to these things. Take history for example. Many history books contain harsh, real life facts about things that went on in the past. A song, book, or movie about slavery can cause some people to be offended. Whether it's because the person opposes slavery greatly or they believe that slavery was a good thing, people have different feelings towards it. Another good example is movies. Some people might find a movie offensive because of words said or if a certain person dies first, while others could care less. Additionally, many things that are found offensive to one person can make something more interesting to someone else. There are many movies nowdays that can be seen as very offensive. But honestly, the offensive things happening might just make someone else want to know more about what's going on. It is practically the same with books. I myself have read plenty of things that would make some people cry or even get really mad or disgusted. Even though in the end, I find them to be exceptionally books. It just on how you view it. So, should things that are found offensive to one person be removed from a library? The answer is no. There are just too many things that can be taken offensively. If you start taking away these things, libraries are only going to become vacant. Younger people will stop coming because materials will be less interesting. You will lose artifacts and stories about the history of the world. There will also only be so many books to read, if ever a non-offensive book could even be found. My advise to libraries, keep materials that can be found extremely offensive in their own area, away from younger people who might react strongly. Maybe even put a sticker on the book, if possible, letting people know just what they're dealing with, because ultimately, censorship does more harm than good.
366	3343	2	3	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I adhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I believe that the books and other items should stay in the shelves of the library that censorship in libraries is unnecessary. As Katherine Paterson stated there will be no books left on the shelves if you take every book off that someone in the community finds offensive. What is offensive to one person may not be considered offensive in another persons point of view. Children, teens, and adults have their own right to choose whatever book they want to read, movie they want to watch , or music they want to listen to. If it is a child or a young teen then I believe that the parents should have a say in what their children read or watch. In my case I am not allowed to listen to offensive music or watch rated R movies but that shouldn't mean that it should be taken off the shelves of the library. Just because that is what my family believes to be right does not mean it is the only way to live. A person has their own rights to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to. They can make the choice by the way they have been raised or just because that is what they think is right or wrong. If they think that a book is offensive then they don't have to read it, they have the right to say no and put the book back on the self. If they think that the book is appropriate then they can read it and there is no law stating that they have to share the book with anyone else. If there is a book out there that is offensive in your view and you read it there is no reason you have to agree with it. Every person is free to disagree with anything they want to disagree with. If you are a parent to a child and you are uncomfortable with them reading, listening, or watching something that is offensive you should set the rules early in life with them. Parents should make sure that their children are not reading inappropriate things or listening to offensive music or watching 13+ or rated R movies. Therefore, if you are comfortable with your children seeing and hearing offensive things then you don't have to worry about what is out there in the community.The things that your children are watching, reading, listening to isn't a problem and if it becomes a problem in the parents eyes then they have the right to stop the children from reading the offensive books or watching the bad movies and listening to the music that the view as offensive. Every parent and family is different, as long as your child knows the rules and what you believe in then there is no need for censorship in libraries. In my family I am not allowed to listen to offensive music. Offensive music in my house is considered music with curse words in the lyrics. The words that my family considers offensive may be different then what other families consider offensive. I know that I don't want to and can't listen to those certain songs but that does not mean that I can't be friends or be around people that listen to that kind of music. Just because that is what my family believes in does not mean that it should be taken of the shelves of the library or any other place. What my family believes in may not be the right thing in another familys view. Every person has their own right and if they want to listen to that music then they should be able to. My family also believes that at my age right now I should not watch rated R movies. If you took all the rated R movies off the shelves, then half the movies would be gone and that is not fair to the people who enjoy rated R movies. What my family believes may not be what other families believe in. I know what I stand for and I will do what I think is right and I won't listen to offensive music or watch rated R movies. In no way though does that mean that other children, teens, adults shouldn't enjoy that kind of music and those movies. In conclusion, I believe that censorship should not be used in libraries. It is every persons own right and they are capable on making decisions that they think are the right thing to do. Parents also have a say in what they want their children to watch, read, or listen to. They can monitor what their children are reading, watching, or listening to and if they find it offensive they can stop their children. It is not necessary to take the items off the shelf. In my family, my parents find some types of music and movies offensive and I know when I go to the library or any other place that I won't get those
367	3344	2	3	Offensive media is everywhere. From books to music lyrics, our culture embraces us with it. Children that see inappropriate media can pick up bad behavior. This can then lead to a child having a hard time associating with his peers. Adults are also affected by inappropriate media if they see their favorite celebrity or any other role model use inappropriate behavior. This could make an adult emotionally unhealthy and they might become violent or depressed. Finally, our world could be better if offensive media were abolished altogether. People's lives could be enriched with good, clean entertainment instead of being corrupted with inappropriate media. One can clearly see that offensive media must be pulled from our country's libraries immediately. Inappropriate media is surrounding us daily, including children. What children see they imitate, even in the first couple years of their lives. So if they hear a swear word on t.v or see someone doing drugs, they might imitate it. Clearly this is inappropriate behavior for a child. If the child is exposed to inappropriate media, for a long period of time, they might think that it is ok to use it in everyday life. Their social skills and mind is being corrupted because of offensive media. Libraries should pull inappropriate media off of their shelves because it can corrupt a child's mind and stunt their development. Another reason why libraries should pull off offensive media is because adults can pick up different offensive habits as well. Just as children can pick up the offensive habit of swearing, so can adults if they are exposed to it for a long period of time. Besides swearing, adults can also think that killing someone is ok because they saw it in a movie. They could then pick up a violent weapon and try to kill someone if they are angry. This is not a healthy way to express your feelings towards someone if they are making you angry. Our country's libraries should pull off inappropriate media from their shelves because it can turn adults into being emotionally unhealthy, leading to harmful actions. Finally, inappropriate media should be pulled off library shelves because our world could be a better place without it. Media is one of the root causes of why people act the way they do. If they see their favorite celebrity getting arrested for a DUI in a magazine, they might think that it is ok to drink and drive. Another example is if people read about someone doing drugs in a book, they might want to try and experiment with drugs themselves. This can lead to people doing crazy things that can be harmful to other lives around them. Offensive media is almost anywhere. When children see inappropriate media, they might think that it is ok to imitate it. Adults, when exposed to enough offensive media, can pick up nasty habits like swearing, killing or doing drugs which, in turn, can lead to to being emotionally unhealthy. With out inappropriate media on our library shelves, our world would be a better place. We would have less conflict, less deaths, and better lives that are enriched, not corrupted, with quality media. Millions of lives could be made better if libraries pulled off inappropriate media from their shelves, thus fostering a more positive and healthy society.
368	3345	2	3	All of us have rights, all of us have the same chance to express what we feel, think or believe. Freedom is the most beautiful and important thing we have and nobody can take that away from us: its just something that belongs to ourselves and that everybody does have. As humans it is not easy to understand other people's thoughts and it could turn kinda of hard to accept the opinions that strangers from us can apport. A library is a place where we can find all kind of material that can easily answer many or our questions, sometimes some material can be offensive and make a target of people feel unconfortable as well as there is material that can be really helpful through our searching. If i had the right to remove any magazine, book or movie off the shelf, i would at least think about it before remove it and consider how helpful and worth it it could be for someone that really needs it, and if everybody else had the same right as me, the we wouldn't have any material at all in the library. Music is a big topic to talk about, we all know there are people that are really used to listen to a type of music that other people can call it as 'rude music' and i could be pretty much offensive for kids. I trully believe it wont be fear for any of us to labeled people because of the music they like, the books they read or the movies they watch. We need to understand nobody is better than nobody and we also need to respect other people's feelings, its something that we have to work on, and remembering that freedom of expression is important, we should approach potentially offensive material with careful consideration for its potential value to others, even if we disagree with it personally, as labeling and censorship ultimately limit everyone's access to diverse perspectives.
369	3346	2	3	Should books, magazines, or movies that are found offensive be removed from the shelves? I think that the book, magazine, or movie should stay on the shelf even if it is found offensive. If it is offensive to one person, it doesn't mean that it is to every person. Everyone has their own view on the subject of offensive or not. These materials can be seen as art or expressions of thought.  I don't think the person that wrote the book or magazine meant for it to be offensive. They were just writing what they thought went along with the story and some people took offense from the book or magazine. But, they shouldn't argue over it because, like I said before, the author probably didn't mean for it to be offensive. People have the freedom to choose what they want to read or view.  In conclusion, the books should stay on the shelves. Everyone has different points of view, and censoring material limits the diversity of thought and expression. The author probably didn't mean for the book or magazine to be offensive, so maintaining availability allows for individual interpretation and choice.
370	3347	2	3	Censorship in the world is getting worse everyday. Many people believe that some material is unsuitable. I believe that if it is unsuitable for others does not make it unsuitable for some. I believe people have the right to read,watch, or listen to what they want as long as it is not breaking any laws. I am torn on this topic because I am against censorship, but I am also for it when laws are being broken. I believe that people should have the right to read whatever they want. Granted, some people read very incriminating books that could get them in a lot of trouble, but not everyone should be punished for another persons mistake. Sometimes you hear about terrorist groups and other illegal groups, but usually they do not market to everyday people. I think that when it becomes a threat to the United States they should remove material. Another simple fact is that the constitution in the United States that we have the freedom of speech, which basically means we can print and read whatever we want. Many people depend on the constitution to make their lives seem safer and sometimes there is a book,article, movie, or a song that goes beyond our limits. I believe that some people use materials wrongly sometimes to get ahead and to make a name for themselves. I just think that people should write for the pure joy of it, not to persuade people to do something bad,or give bad thoughts or ideas. The government has the right to control what we partake in, but does that seem fair? I understand thier logic behind this matter, but just because it has offensive matter does not mean they should remove it from society. I believe that if people want to experience it they should be able to without wondering if it will gone the next day. If people do not agree with this 'offensive' matter, then they should not take part in it. This is a true enough statement that it just makes you wonder about their logic. So, does the government have the right to say what we can and cannot read? I don't believe so, but that is my opinion. I believe that people should read whatever they so choose to and should not think they are breaking laws for some 'offensive' material. Freedom of the speech is what people have to look up to for the government, but how are people supposed to feel secure when they are reading a book, watching a movie, or listening to music that can be assumed 'offensive'? In conclusion, the line between protecting society and infringing on individual liberties is a delicate one, and I believe erring on the side of freedom, while holding individuals accountable for their actions, is the best path forward.
371	3348	2	3	Yes, I have come across books, movies, music, and magazines that deal with topics like drugs, sexuality, and violence. I believe that books, movies, music, and magazines should be taken off library shelves if they contain anything related to drugs, sexuality, and violence. One reason for this belief is that young children might access these materials and learn about harmful behaviors. Another reason is that a library shouldn't be a place where parents and kids are exposed to such content. These kinds of materials, in my opinion, should be kept in a separate building, away from children, with restricted access. Also, from personal experience, I once found a book about drugs that was inappropriate for kids, showing images of drugs and their effects. In conclusion, I hope that readers understand the potential impact of these books, movies, music, and magazines on those who consume them.
372	3349	2	3	There are tons of books in the library that people @MONTH1 find offensive to young readers today. I think that these materials should not be removed from the shelves. People have a right to read what they choose to read. There are many reasons why I think these materials shouldn't be removed from the library. First of all, there are so many books that could be found as 'offensive.' @CAPS1 removing all of these offending books, you would basically be removing half the books in the library. Most young adult books have something to do with teens, drugs, violence, and other things that would come off as offensive. These books are usually the ones that teenagers read. Just because they're reading them doesn't mean their actions will be affected. These types of books are read for the purpose of entertainment and not meant to harm or offend anybody. Libraries offer a diverse selection, and it's up to the individual to determine what's suitable for them. Secondly, I think that people have a right to choose what they want to read, listen to, and watch. Books, music, movies, and magazines are sold for this purpose. Everyone has a different opinion and taste to what they like or dislike. Limiting access goes against the principle of intellectual freedom. Finally, I think that censoring what is put on the shelves would be a mistake. There are tons of great books or movies that could be found offensive and to take them off the shelf would make them less known. Children wouldn't know about them, and they could be missing out on some great stories. Exposure to different perspectives is important for growth. Everyone has an opinion, and watching out for your children is understandable. Censoring what is available at the library would make finding books harder for other people. Libraries are meant to have different types of material because everyone has a different taste. Removing materials based on subjective offense would limit the library's purpose and deny access to those seeking diverse perspectives.
373	3350	2	3	I don't think that they should be removed from the shelves. Everyone has a right to read it at some point in time. To where no little kids can rent the book. If they are complaining about how it's vulgar or sexual, then you shouldn't take it away. Try something else such as an adult section to keep it away from younger readers. One person in @MONTH1 may love a book that has some violence in it, and on the other hand, you in @MONTH1 have a person who is really religious and can't stand to see it.  There are very many viewpoints on this topic. The parents who don't want their kids to be exposed to this type of lifestyle have valid concerns, but some people don't really think about it being as bad as the next person. If it's a book you dislike on a bookshelf and you don't like it put out in plain sight, should you really be the one to make the decision on who takes it down?  Some people don't know what their kids like to read. If they have the final say on what gets taken down, it in @MONTH1 may affect the kids' reading habits. What if your kid wants to read a horror book and you choose not to let those kinds of books on the shelf anymore? Then they don't want to read the books that are left up on the shelf. I'd rather read a book that interests me than a book that I dislike.  My point of view on this topic is simple: I don't think the parents should be in control of what we read as long as it's appropriate. I think the decision should be left for the government to say which books should and shouldn't be taken away, ensuring a more balanced and less biased approach to censorship.
374	3351	2	3	When it comes to censorship I believe that very few things should be removed. Just because it is found offensive by some does not mean it is offensive to all. A material should only be removed if and only if that material offends an over ruling majority of people. If you find it offensive just ignore it you don't have to buy it. Maybe somebody else finds it interesting and it comtains the information that they have been seeking. When it comes to books, music, movies or magazines I believe almost anything should be allowed except for material that depicts nudity or drugs and alcohol. Other than that a little cursing here and there and some violence is perfectly acceptable, but it should probably be kept from small children if it's to bad. Usually if a child is exposed to that type of material they usually grow up believing that whatever they saw as a child is completly acceptable. Sometimes it's violence sometimes it's other things like drugs or alcohol, whatever the case may be. Many parents believe that certain material should be banned because it exposes their child to bad morals. But my belief is that if your a good parent then shouldn't have to worry about that type of stuff. If you really do not want your child to be of any part of it then take actions to do such. For example if you don't want your child watching a certain television show then block it. Don't just think they won't watch it and then when they do you get mad at the people who created the show. It's not their fault maybe you as a parent should have made sure in the first place that your child did not see that material. There are some people out there that believe that if any material depicts anything bad then it should be removed. But what I believe is that this is America and people can read and write whatever they want, and if you have something to say about it then that's fine by me you can believe whatever you would like to believe. People should be able to keep their freedom of speech and be creative without being ridiculed by people, because limiting expression ultimately diminishes us all.
375	3352	2	3	Yes, because children should not be reading anything that is like that. Children should be reading books that have good information in them, information the children should be learning while they are in class. Well, if the books, music, and other stuff to read and look at have bad stuff in it, it should be removed from the shelf because children should not be looking at it. Some music has bad language in it, and children should not be listening to music like that. Also, movies that have inappropriate scenes in them should not be watched by children because it's not good for the children to see all that, and parents should do something about it if their children are watching movies with inappropriate scenes in them, as well as magazines that have inappropriate pictures, because children are too young to see that kind of material. Therefore, removing inappropriate content is essential to protect children and guide them towards positive and educational resources.
376	3353	2	3	My thoughts on censorship in libraries is yes some books, music, movies, magazines, and etc., should be taken off of the shelves if they are offensive. If they are left on the shelves some very small child or teens could come up and reach for a book and find that it has bad things in it that are meant for adults. The child will ask the caregiver that they are with 'what does this picture mean?', and they will most likely not know what to say at that moment. Parents and caregivers are not always up to explaining or want to explain as soon as they have to about things sometimes. Everyone goes through life with different things they have to learn at different rates. Somethings should be taught when we young like how to brush our teeth, but somethings should be left until we are older like having babies or drinking.  When parents going through the explanation of something like making babies you do not want it to be when they are only five years old. With books in a library with pictures of men and women questions like that do get asked to young. Libraries are public places and should be safe for any age no matter whether they are young babies or adults. Public schools have libraries in them also, and I would not want a child reading a sexually explicit or violent book with bad or offensive things in it. It does not just have to be a book with bad things in it, but it could also be something to do with religions. Everyone has their thoughts and comments on at least one religion. If you have grown up a Christian your whole life, and a kid picks up a book dealing with jews they will ask someone about it.  Young kids and teens can always find things that they should not at certain ages, but why not make it less by not letting a library be censored? When you were younger your parent did not want to take you to the library and be asked an offensive question because of a book, music, movie, or magazine. It has worked for so many years, so we should not have to change it now, ensuring a safe and age-appropriate environment for all library patrons.
377	3354	2	3	I dont believe that it should matter what books are in a library. If you think a book would be offensive to you, dont read it. If you were to read a book with opinions about a cirtian race or religion, just keep your opinion to yourself. Most people make a big deal about cirtian things to get attention. If a library was split up into sections about topics and such, it would help a lot, and it would be a quicker way to get your books and get out to make room for others. I honestly have not seen a @CAPS1 in a school library, but its probly because I did not spend much time lookin for it. And if there isnt one, its probly because someone complained about it. If you are religious, you should have the right to be able to read what you want. Theres all kinds of weird books in the library, and a lot of people just look at them for the fun of it. I dont know why some people have so many problems with certian things. Like I said before, if you dont like it, dont read it. Ultimately, libraries should contain a diverse range of materials, and individuals should exercise personal responsibility in choosing what they consume.
378	3355	2	3	I don't believe any of those materials are offensive if found in a library. But if children look elsewhere to find those things, they will find them anytime. The offensive materials are out there to be picked up by some people, including children. The books aren't offensive if found in the adult area, because children wouldn't read them as they're too long and lack pictures. Music is offensive, but only if found in the adult area, as kids aren't interested in music at that age and wouldn't bother with it. Movies and Magazines have offensive things in them and can be found anywhere, but finding them in a library is rare. The only offensive thing you'll likely find in a library is a magazine, as they come in various types and are easily accessible. To explain the offensive and non-offensive books, I'll talk about '@CAPS1 @CAPS2.' @CAPS3's book has bad words, sexual scenes, drugs, gang violence, and racism. @CAPS3's book is so offensive that children's parents wouldn't let them read it, but it's based on a true story. Everything in that book was real, and people need to know what happened and why those people did those things. Some books @MONTH1 be offensive, but you can learn from others' mistakes by reading them. Everything @MONTH1 be offensive in one way, but from another point of view, it's a learning experience. People who made those mistakes could tell children that those things aren't worth it, because everything has its purpose. Books can tell people's life stories, movies are based on stories, and music can tell the life of people by poetry, even if magazines are mainly for gossip. Therefore, while potentially offensive material exists, it can also serve as a learning opportunity, offering different perspectives and highlighting the consequences of certain actions.
379	3356	2	3	Is the censorship in libraries really necessary? In my opinion it is, but only to a certain extent. I believe that most people who frequently go to the library know what types of books, movies, magazines, etc., are for more of the adult group and more of the teenage/children group. I think the censoring is helping to keep our youth from taking the words and actions and using them in their daily lives. If we don't want them to read or even hear them, I think the censorship is a great thing in ways.  I believe if the censorship were to go away in some forms, I would use a different method of censorship that was a bit more on the more favored sides for adults. The censorship would still be at the library in a certain form. There would be something just a bit different or new about whatever that person is checking out.  If we could, when people are checking out these books, movies, magazines, etc., we could use a rating just like movies do. When a child who is 10 comes to the library to check out an item and they find one they are interested in, they could bring it to the librarian, and the librarian would check the rating and the age of the child with their library card and see if that item is appropriate for that child. There could be many ratings G, PG, PG-13, and R. I think ages 6-12 are for the G-PG, the ages 13-16 are for PG-13 and ages 17 and up for rated R.  I see many times when children are learning words, phrases, and actions from movies, books, etc., that make them think it is ok to do or say these things. I think not. In my opinion, I think that this idea could help out our youth and their parents make better choices in the content they are submitting themselves to. So if you feel like this is a good idea, contact your local library and tell them you are in favor of the rating, 'rating system.' Don't wait until you have forgotten, call now. Such a system would allow libraries to maintain a balance between protecting young people and providing access to a wide range of materials for adults.
380	3357	2	3	Books, movies, music, and even video games are all important in this life, and enviorment of ours. They all have a learning process. When you read you learn, when you watch a movie you learn, even when you listen to music you can learn. Weather its about past present or future, everyone has the right to learn it's part of being a citizen. Speaking of all this I belive just beacuse one book, or one movie makes someone uncomfortable i dont think that you should take that away. Thats not only taking away from your kid, or yourself thats taking away from everyone else. Just like the book huckleberry fin it's a wonderful book i love it because it's about the old days where they still belived in slavery, and there were still some good-hearted people around. This book to some would be very offensive beacuse of the fact it has the word nigger in it one-hundered and twenty-seven times. In fact last year at my school a mother tried to get it taken out, because she didnt want her son to read it he was actually a mixed boy but thankfully the committee saved it and it's still here. That's our history and everyone needs to learn some of it, weather it's offensive or not. As well as movies that can and mostly likely is offensive to people, they still should not have that stuff taken off either, like I said earlier thats taking away from everyone else. If you dont wanna see it then dont buy it, or if something that you find innapropriate comes on just change the channel. History is important and I dont think people should keep you from your right as a citizen and deprive you from learning what you wanna learn or need to learn for the future. Now the music part i can understand, some songs be a little innapropiate for younger listeners so like i said before again change the station or dont buy that CD. Dont deprive people of what they wanna learn, watch or listen to. People that feel offended or embrassed should be ashamed of them self because that is very selfish, and rude. No one should be ashamed of who they are or any movie that describes the old days in the way it actually happened, if they put it in the nice way then it would all just be a lie. That's why I dont belive in censorship. It should not happen, any book, movie, magazine, CD should be available to who wants it, because limiting access is a disservice to understanding and personal growth.
381	3358	2	3	People see libraries as a good place for knowledge and just an information place, many people like them and some dread the fact of hearing the word, 'LIBRARY'. To be honest I only know a handful of people who use libraries in my life as a source for information now days but; Can some information from libraries be offensive to others? The answer is based by your own opinion to be quite honest, but yes I think some information that can be picked up from your local LIBRARY can be rather, disturbing 'per say'. Theres books and information that you wish you would have never picked up in your whole life, then again thats everywhere. Now music and movies etc. is sort of the same way, some MAY not agree with what he/she picks out and you know they might be interested in. Can it be offensive to people? The answer is of coarse it can, but because people will be people. You MAY not agree on something, but your friend might think entirely different from what you are thinking, everyone is titled to their opinion on anything, well normally. Now if they have graphic movies or explicit music on the shelf where your little son/daughter can just grab, I could see that as a major issue. Some parents do not want their children listening to that music at such a young age, even though the way things are in america your child will hear or see those things, it's life. If that is the case where a five year old can pull a graphic movie or a cd that a parent doesn't want them to see or hear, then I do'nt nessasarily think it should be banned from the LIBRARY. I believe it should be handled well mannered and it should be moved, to a not so easy reach to a five year old. These are common arguements people have, about many places and about simular disagreements. Yes, I agree some things found in a LIBRARY can be found offensive to some but my answer stays as, 'No' it shouldn't be removed unless it really is that offensive. If there is something that offensive in the LIBRARY and multiple people find it offensive in the community, I would take it to the people in charge of the local LIBRARY and discuss the material in question with them.
382	3359	2	3	I think that if you feel like they are saying bad things that you should not read the books or magazines and don't listen to the music and don't look at the movies. If you feel offensive about it, just don't look at it because a person might not find it offensive. It is part of life to look at something offensive, so why do it now? I think that if they do that, they might just take some adult shows off the air because there are a lot of shows out there that are offensive, and some do not like that, but they don't take it off the air, so why take books, music, movies, and magazines off the shelves?  I don't believe that they should do that at all because if I don't like it, I don't look at it, so I don't get mad at something somebody says about my belief. A person might not like the same music you like; I might not like the same music he or she likes, but I don't want to take it off the shelves; they should just stop looking and listening to all this stuff a person says about their belief. Therefore, personal choice and avoidance are the best solutions for dealing with offensive content, rather than censorship.
383	3360	2	3	Libraries should not be able to remove books, movies, and magazines off the shelves just because some kids might be offended. If the town libraries and school libraries took out the cool movies, magazines, and books that most kids love to read and watch then the kids that like those books, movies, and magazines would not return to the library any more. For example, I like to listen to hard rock, heavy metal, and rap. But, the people that go to church just like to listen to church music. If you're with your friend one night because he invited you to come to church with him and you pull in the parking lot listening to your rap music some people might not like it. This doesn't mean that they should take the things people don't like off the shelves in order to satisfy them.  Libraries should have a policy stating that if a child should check out a book or magazine or rent a movie, that they should have the child's parents sign and return a permission slip stating that their child has their permission to rent this book, magazine, or movie. Libraries should have an age limit to check out books and magazines, so children can access materials appropriate for their developmental stage. If kids would want to rent a movie then they would have to have a permission slip signed by their parents and returned. This permission slip will and can be used for all movies.  Libraries should not remove their books, magazines, or movies. They should make a policy to allow older kids to check them out. So, library material should be a choice, and with parental permission policies and age limits in place, libraries can maintain a diverse collection while respecting community values.
384	3361	2	3	Some people @MONTH1 think that certain book, movies, magazines, or music should be removed from libraries because they @MONTH1 be found offensive. I believe that libraries should not rid their shelves of 'offensive' material. What really makes something offensive? If someone were to tell me that it looked as if I've lost weight, I would find that offensive. The person wouldn't have meant it that way, though. Although I would have found it slighly rude, another person @MONTH1 have found it to be a nice compliment. With this logic, can one really conclude that anything is truely offensive? By saying something is offensive, you're stating your own opinion. Even if they aren't the same as everyone else's, everyone is intitled to their own opinions; equality is something most people find very important. Because of this, one person's definiton of offensive shouldn't be held higher than another's. If we rid libraries of 'offensive' material, that is exactly what you would be doing; you'd be making one person's definition of offensive superior to another person's. I also believe libraries should not get rid of 'offensive' material because by doing so, they would probably be getting rid of a lot of interesting material. Let's use my religious beliefs for an example. I am @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Basically, I do not believe in '@CAPS3'. If someone were to write a book about my religion, I would find it interesting. Some @CAPS4 @MONTH1 find it to be offensive, though. So if a library got rid of that book because someone found it offensive, I wouldn't want to go there as often. When I go to a library, I want to find a book that I'd enjoy reading. If all the material that is found offensive was taken out of the library, would there really be anything left? If so, I doubt many people would find it interesting. I also believe this because by taking a book off the shelf because you find it offensive, wouldn't you be offending the author? As I said before, everyone is intitled to their own opinions. Because of this, libraries should allow authors to speak their minds. By taking their books off the shelves, you'd be offending them. They took their time and effort to think about and write that book, and for you to offend them by taking it off the shelf, you'd be controdicting the entire purpose of removing it from the shelf. In conclusion, I believe that nothing can truely be defined as offensive. Also, people should be able to speak their minds, and a library should reflect the diversity of thought in society. Therefore, libraries should not attempt to rid there shelves of 'offensive' material.
385	3362	2	3	Dear @CAPS1: Have you ever seen an offensive book on a shelf in a library? Would you want your children influenced by these findings? These are the question you need to ask yourself about certain materials that appear in libraries. As a concerned citizen I am writing to you to reflect my opinion on censorship in libraries. In my own personal experiences I have come across magazines, books, and music that are offensive. I believe that these materials should not be found in libraries. There are many people that still would want these materials, so my suggestion is that there should be a seperate room for the offensive materials. If there was a seperate room, we can keep these materials away from young kids. When I get older and have children, I believe that the library should be a kid friendly place. In order to make that happen we need find a place for these materials or not have them at all. Libraries need to be somewhere were anyone can go: a college kid trying to prepare for a test, a young child wanting to discover @PERSON1 like Dr. Seuss, or a old man wanting to enjoy the peace and quiet. The distraction of offensive materials are not needed in a library. Libraries are places to learn and explore the different sources that are inside. For young children it is the fairytale land where anything is possible and the unimaginable can become true. If there are materials that adults do not want their children to see, they @MONTH1 may not be comfortable having their child there. Libraries need to be kid friendly places, so that all the ages can enjoy what it has to offer. As you can see, offensive materials should not be in libraries. All ages should be able to enjoy what a library has to offer, and with some materials that is not possible. Please consider the following, so that the library can continue to be a place that is available for everyone. Kind regards, @PERSON2.
386	3363	2	3	The bookstores should be removed because all students want the library to have many books, like Spanish books or books about different cultures, so students can learn different languages and do many things with those books. For example, they can read aloud and rewrite the same book with different words. Also, the music and movies need to be removed because some DVDs are spoiled and need to be taken out. Libraries in the world borrow some books for many people to take, and people can take the books without paying anything, which is why people want libraries to be free. Also, libraries need to expand to many parts of the world; many people think this is a great idea, but some disagree because libraries sometimes can't lend books, DVDs, magazines, etc. That's why libraries need people to know that libraries are not borrowing books as much as they used to. I think the library needs to go to the people and show what they have and lend the books and DVDs that people want. Sometimes, the library can rent DVDs that are interesting and hard to find elsewhere, like new movies. If the library doesn't have the DVDs, people can go to the bookstore to find them. We would have to read more, like many people do, which is a great idea. And the library needs more style to excite people and encourage them to take books and read, making the library a vibrant and appealing place for learning and discovery.
387	3364	2	3	Censorship is important, especially pertaining to what books, magazines, movies, and music almost all people are reading, watching, and listening to. Some of the media such as books and magazines in libraries everywhere can be highly offensive to certain people or can send off the wrong message to children and teens. So, should we take them off the shelves? I personally think no; most media aspects that are on the shelves in libraries can be very offensive to people, but a lot of it has to do with people's opinions. The readers are the ones that are claiming that the books and other media aspects in libraries are offensive. The authors, directors, and singers just do what they do, and the judgment and opinions all come from the people, fans, and critics. We shouldn't be taking it all off library shelves just because it is offensive to some people. This leads back to the quote from Katherine Paterson when she states: 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We can't take everything off the shelves because everyone's opinions are different, so if we censor everything, there won't be anything left. Right now, they are doing a good job with censoring everything such as putting a rating on video games, and movies. Rated R movies are known to be for adult watchers and same goes for video games. Music they play on the radio is censored of all the foul language, so they make an effort. That leaves people the choice to watch, listen, or read the things they want, and they have to know beforehand that it might offend them. Although sometimes people think censoring those media aspects is not enough censorship, that's about all that can be done to not offend others. By taking everything off the shelves because of people's opinions, it could potentially make someone else angry or them being lacked of the things they want to read or watch. Censorship can be wholesome without removing all media off the shelves and in the world, and ratings and edited versions allow for a balanced approach.
388	3365	2	3	Censorship in Libraries I know as well as everyone else does, that you can find almost anything, reading related, in the library. There is all different kinds of stuff in there. From children's books, to love stories and people's magazines, newspapers, movies, and music. Everyone is welcome in the library, of course, but is everyone aloud to look at whatever they want?  I personally think it's a good idea to have all of this stuff in the library, for anyone, even though some of it's not very appropriate. For people who sit at home and don't have a library, maybe they want to know about something specific and the first place they would think about going is the library. Nobody can really help with what people @MONTH1 find in the library but i think it's a good idea to keep that kind of stuff in a public place. You could go on the internet to get whatever information you need, yeah, but, what if the internet doen't have what you're looking for? I like books better then internet myself. Anybody can put information on the computer, but atleast when it's in a book, it's true, because it has to be published and read by someone that wouldn't let a book with false information be sent out to the public. The publishing process itself acts as a filter.  If the libraians are worried about underaged kids getting into books that they're not suppose to, then put it somewhere where they can't reach. Put the adult books in the adult section, and don't let the little kids go in that area. You could always put them up high too so the kids wouldn't even know they was there. All the libraries I've ever been to, had their own sections, the adults would go to their section, and the kids would go to their's. If the parents are afraid of what their kids will find, then keep them home and don't let them go to the library. Make your own at home, then you could put whatever books and magazines you want in there. Ultimately, it's up to parents to monitor what their children are exposed to, rather than relying on censorship in a public library.
389	3366	2	3	Should certain materials be removed from our library shelves just because it has uncensored materials inside of it? My opinion is no, actually heck no! Now don't get me wrong, but I'm not the type of person that likes reading materials like that all the time, but every once in a while there is a really good book or magazine I would like to read that is uncensored. The bad thing is that I am told I cannot just because it says something or shows a picture of something a teenager supposedly shouldn't be seeing. One of my main questions on this material is why are they allowed to show statues of the early Roman times in our history books but not materials we hear and see on a daily basis? Half of the time the statues are of a naked person. I don't see why that is allowed but other materials about our times are not. We are in the time period were people are open that it doesn't bother them to see that stuff. Yes, some materials are not suited for teenagers my age, but honestly I hear offensive things all the time when I walk through the halls in my high school. Someone @MONTH1 have an opinion about how the material is offensive, but if its so offisive why do they bother even complaining or thinking about it. Yes, everyone has a right to their own opinion, but thats there opinion and that doesn't make them always right. That person can have there opinion but other people have opinions that might oppose the other persons opinion. Does that make them wrong? You will never know because everyone has there own and who knows whose opinion is right. Another statement I would like to just throw out there is that we teenagers are learning to make our own decisions because in the near future we are going to be adults and have to make those choices on our own. So, just let us choose if we would like to read material with uncensored things in it. It is our choice, why can't we just choose it without people telling us we cannot. I still do not see why it is such a big deal of reading uncensored material. Why can't they just allow the materials in our libraries. Don't make any decisions for us because we can do it ourselves, we are learning how to be more adult like, right? It seems contradictory to expose us to certain historical depictions while shielding us from contemporary content. Ultimately, restricting access to these materials hinders our growth and ability to think critically, so it is essential that we have the freedom to choose what we read.
390	3367	2	3	"The censorship of certain media is such a controversial topic. Whether a certain piece of material is considered offensive and should be censored or not is more often opinionated rather than logically opposed, because it really does all come down to someone's opinion on this matter. It is too difficult for most people to step in someone else's shoes or be persuaded from a viewpoint different from their own or even escape pressures from the general public to consider something else. Things get censored for a lot of reasons, too! Sometimes they're just so intentionally offensive that perhaps the author or producer wants it to be censored or would appreciate the controversy, or that a new view or opinion is so radical and against a majority of the population that it is just considered offensive for being so different. Well, when does someone have a right to take a song off the air or pull a book permanently from a shelf? The question becomes, at what point does public outcry warrant the removal of content?  The first thing that needs to be contemplated is if something is offensive or not. There are extremes to pieces of media where one sometimes must ask, ""WHAT were they thinking when they made that?"" A movie being so outrageously graphic or violent is a fine example (although the same thing can happen in books, just with words instead of pictures). At the same time though, whether or not something you might think as unnecessary gore in a film might just be WHAT I'm excited to see when I go to the cinema - it's all opinionated!  Another interesting thought is that somebody might come up with a revolutionary, radical scientific theory and write a whole novel or film a documentary explaining it all, but certain groups of people might claim that it is offensive to them. However, we might investigate into that theory ourselves and not be offended in the slightest. This is understandable though, people grow up in an environment that has its own set of ethics and principles, and people will honestly believe them and probably stick with those fundamentals throughout their lifetime. If you go against someone's beliefs that they hold so dear like that, they would of course be offensive to them. Does that mean that the something should be censored just because it offends a couple of groups in a population?  Whether or not something is to be torn from the access of the public is left up to the opinions of the general public themselves. The opinion of the public is created by the current time, trends, ethics, and problems that are going on. When something goes against too many of those things, people get upset. If most people are upset by something, it will probably start disappearing from sight. It's bad for business, and libraries are losing customers already due to most people not having an urge to read anymore with all of the stuff that you can do otherwise. Certain things can just put a bad taste in your mouth, and if someone gets that too often when they go to a library, they probably won't go there anymore.  So when it comes down to censorship in libraries, or anywhere, its just a bunch of opinions. If the general public does not like something, it will stop showing up. Certain books or other pieces of media are asking for the controversy that many subjects bring, while others are just unintentionally going against certain groups of people. People's beliefs are determined by where they grew up and when, and they'll hold on to those things for their lifetime. If something goes against those, people will be offended, and if enough people are upset, it gets taken away, demonstrating that censorship, at its core, is often a reflection of the prevailing sentiments and values of a society at a particular point in time."
391	3368	2	3	Isn't it shocking that some books, music, movies and magazines you find on your library shelf today aren't appropriate for the little ones. I believe that if you have to question whether a child should be listening or viewing this item then it shouldn't be in or around a child section at all. Some content could be offensive to not just children but also to teenagers and adults. Some music today contain words that are children shouldn't be exposed to. Music such as hip/hop and rap today contain degrading comments to men and/or women. I wouldn't want my child listening to this type of music, or reading any book that talks about it. Music today can also be offensive to cultures, religion, sexual orientation and race. Books or music with comments such as that should have notes written on them stating what they contain, like a warning label. I was reading a book called 'Adventures of Lily' that i had picked up in the child section. After the first chapter I had wondered who who call this a children book. The character was using profanity and talking about sex the whole time. My child shouldn't be looking for a book on pie then find out its not about pie. I once was watching a movie with my two year old that we got from the library. The movie was full of inappropriate words, therefore I had to shut it off immediately. Movies like that should not be on the shelf at the library for my child to view. I now have to worry about what we check out. I also have had a few bad reading experiences. Magazines is a big one. Some magazines today contain content such as innappropriate pictures and words. Magazines should stay at the grocery store rather then a library that I take my child to. Books, music, movies and magazines should stay out of the childrens section; if they are only meant for adult viewing keep them in the adult section. Any parent would tell you that they don't agree with some of the stuff on your local library shelf today. Offensive content shouldn't be found in the library at all. I know now to keep a better eye on what my child is reading, but the library also needs to ensure age appropriateness to safeguard our children.
392	3369	2	3	All kid's have their own style of books, some people like scary, funny, or romance books, but can we really take that to an offense? We should think of how taking some books off the shelf would affect more than one person, some people might not be mature enough to read the more 'grown up' books or magazines. Libraries have all types of styles for different people; you just might have to look a little harder to find the right book for you. I do not agree that some books and or magazines can be taken offensively. All libraries have different types of books; for example, an elementary school library will not have grown up or teenager books, and a middle school will not have little kid books. We also have to think, does peer pressure affect what books or magazines kids read? For example, when I was in middle school, my friends were all reading romance books, and I was still reading Goosebumps, and I had to change my reading style to fit in, so that's exactly what I did. Books that have offensive content shouldn't be taken off the shelf. I believe that if there are 'offensive' books in your library, just ignore them; you don't have to get that book. We can't just take the more grown up books out because some kids don't know what they're supposed to be reading. Libraries have all different styles of books to fit everyone's taste, so just look for that right book that suites you, and don't take all the books that have an offensive style off the shelf; don't judge a book by its cover, as there is bound to be something for everyone.
393	3370	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' - @PERSON1 If one thinks about it books are such a magical escape from everday life. They can take one anywhere they want to go at anytime. Imagine a world where books are a luxury or where they are simply not present at all. I feel as if this would become an all too real reality if we censor books.  Where would the line be drawn saying a book is unfit to be @CAPS5 READ or placed into circulation. This would hold the world back since we could not express ourselves through our writing. So much would be left unsaid. I believe the quote stated above is quite true. If we place censorship on one book everyone has a right to ban other books as well. Just because certain books, movies, and magazines are deemed offensive to some, does not mean they should be banned for all. No one should we withheld from a book due to age, race, gender, or any other factor.  If one has ever been prohibited from doing something due to age or size the feeling is not pleasant. No one neccessarily said anything mean or hurtful it just feels as if restritions and boundaries were set for no particular reason. I have felt this way multiple times. I remember one time in particular. I went to @LOCATION1 SIX FLAGS with a group of my cousins and their friends. Since I was the youngest I was also the shortest. I could not ride many of the rides there due to my size. I knew why those heighth requirements were set, for my personal safety. This makes sense, but why should one be required to be a certain age to watch a movie or watch a tv show. Honestly some people are more mature than others and grow up faster. Everyone is different. Everyone has a different personality and different perspective, there is no need to ban a book for everyone when we are all different. One should not be ineligible to @CAPS5 READ a book or magazine or watch a movie. Not wanting to is totally differnet from not getting to.  The popular book To @CAPS1 KILL A @CAPS2 MOCKINGBIRD was banned at one time in the @LOCATION2 SCHOOL simply for using the 'n-word'. This angers many especially when one ponders how much slavery as well as the @CAPS3 CIVIL @CAPS4 RIGHTS affected and shaped us into who we are today. America is a great nation because of the @ORGANIZATION1 FIRST AMENDMENT. Do we need to have a @ORGANIZATION1 BAN to @CAPS5 READ! Why should we restrict ourselves and limit our own personal freedoms? If anything is to be banned, I believe it is censorship, for it stifles growth, limits understanding, and ultimately harms our ability to connect with one another through the powerful medium of literature and art.
394	3371	2	3	When one person is given a right to do something, then everyone else should have the right to do the same thing. But every so often, you have someone that abuses their rights to something. I believe that all books, music, movies, magazines, and everything else has a right on a library shelf. And they shouldn't be removed if they are found offensive because in almost every book someone reads, there will be some kind of offense in it. I also believe that all books, music, movies, magazines, and everything else has a purpose to it. And if the purpose is good enough for it to be published then, it should have a good message worth delivering to people, even if it is a little offensive. I've read a few books, watched a few movies, and heard a few songs that were offensive even to me in some way. But, considering that there was more of a purpose to it, and the purpose being a good message, I liked the few movies and songs that most people would say its 'junk'. I don't have a lot of experiences because there isn't a lot that I can say is offensive, but the few songs, movies that are offensive to even me, I believe that there was some kind of good message there. I personally think that no one should have a right to take a book, a piece of music, a magazine, or anything else off a library shelf, even if some find the content disagreeable. Because everything has some kind of purpose to it, and has some kind of message in it for each and every person to discover, it's important to allow access to a wide range of materials.
395	3372	2	3	Yes, I think some books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are overrated and should be addressed, especially since young children visit the library. There should be shelves designated for kids, teenagers, and adults, creating age-appropriate sections for everyone. Young kids are already exposed to things they shouldn't be, like hanging out in the street or with older kids. They watch inappropriate movies that aren't educational. The music they listen to often contains too much cursing and violence. More parents need to spend time with their kids and discuss these issues. Teenagers also need guidance on what to watch and read. I don't think they should be exposed to content about killing or explicit sexual content. Parents should be open and honest with their teenagers about these topics. Parents have likely experienced similar things and can offer valuable advice. There are also certain magazines that should be carefully considered for library shelves. Young children can develop insecurities because they don't resemble actors and actresses in magazines, leading them to rush their lives and try to be someone they're not. Young ladies may desire unrealistic body images, and young men may strive for unattainable physiques. In conclusion, while I don't think books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be entirely removed from the shelves, there should be clear age-based sections for young kids, teenagers, and adults to ensure appropriate access. The music played on the radio should also be more carefully monitored, and magazines shouldn't be readily accessible to children. Teenagers also need guidance on what they watch and read to promote healthy development.
396	3373	2	3	I honestly think that anything should be allowed in libraries. If you think about it, there is a law called freedom of speech. This law should be all the reason for someone not to ban something for what it says. Also, in my opinion, if you find it offensive, you dont have to look at it or read it or listen to it. I remember walking threw the library in town and seeing a large quantity of books. None of these books really seemed offensive. Then again, this library had an upstairs that the more 'colorful' books were at. For example, some adult books etc. These books were offensive. They should not be banned though, they should only be moved. On a different akasion, i remember walking threw the library trying to find a book to help me with an assignment at skool and i seen several young kids looking at some adult books and magazines. I belive that these were put here for advertisements, however, they should be advertised in different areas out of site of kids and teenagers. The age of these children probably varied, but the point remains that some materials are not appropriate for all ages. Although it would be nice to see some books and magazines banned, it would be quite difficult to accomplish. I don't think that anything should ever be banned for what it says or shows or sounds like. Instead, moved from one area to a different area. For example, instead of showing certain things at low levels where younger people can get there hands on, they should be at a higher level or behind the desk, ensuring responsible access to all materials.
397	3374	2	3	Have you ever found a book offensive? Many people can say they have. They might not agree on the point of the book or certain viewpoints in the text. When this happens, people stop reading the book and other books in the same category. Certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offending to certain people. Everyone has opinions, what would be left without books? At my public library, citizens of my city can request certain books, movies, music, or magazines to be put on the shelves. We are very blessed to have this available because if someone cannot afford certain books, they can always rely on the library. Many people have been very thankful for this system and the access it provides. If certain people at the library do not want to order certain books requested by citizens because they find them offensive, what would happen? More people would stop going to the library because there would be no materials sparking their interest. Everyone is titled to their own opinions. Just because one person does not approve of a book does not mean that book should not be offered at the library. There are thousands and thousands of books on display at the public library, that does not mean you have to read all of them. There are also many different genres of novels, movies, music, and magazines. Everyone has interests in different types. If people all liked the same things, would not life be boring? Therefore, a diversity of materials is essential. In conclusion, certain materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are found offending to certain people. Everyone is titled to their own opinions. If a specific book is requested and one person finds it offending, the book should stay in the library. There are many different genres of books, music, movies, and magazines, and removing options based on personal offense limits access and enjoyment for others. Imagine if the library did not have a certain type of novel you enjoyed, would you continue to go? The availability of diverse materials ensures that the library remains a valuable resource for the entire community.
398	3375	2	3	I think libraries shouldn't remove material from the shelves even though it's offensive. Libraries shouldn't remove offensive material because even though it might be offensive to some people, others might still want to learn about that topic. For example, @CAPS1 didn't like the @CAPS2. In some books, there is some offensive stuff about @CAPS2 that was stated by @CAPS4. Some @CAPS2 might take that offensively, but other people from different races or religions might want to learn about what was said. Just because people read about it doesn't mean all of them are going to agree with it; people might have their own point of view, and no one has the right to tell another person what they can or can't like. If censorship starts to occur in libraries or other community places, I think people are going to get mad and it might cause a bigger problem than some people being offended by the material. They might think that they are being told what they can or can't read, listen to, or believe in, and that will cause a bigger conflict and get a lot of people furious. I think it will be simpler if the library has the materials on the shelves, and people who are getting offended by what they have there should ignore it because why would they read or listen to something if it only gets them furious? They might be offended by what one person says, but who cares? Not everyone is going to think or agree with what is being said. It's just a person's point of view; let them be them and just stick with what you think of yourselves and in your beliefs. Not everyone is right and perfect, so just be yourselves, and allowing access to diverse perspectives, even offensive ones, ultimately fosters a more informed and tolerant society.
399	3376	2	3	Materials should not be removed from libraries. It should be left up to a person to decide what they see or view. Books, music, movies, etc., are materials used by everyone and for some a library provides a haven where they can get their hands on such things only and nowhere else, so we shouldn't try to take away any of these things from anybody. One reason why certain materials should not be removed from libraries' shelves is that there will always be some subjects, and materials that a great many people will argue shouldn't be seen, and there will always be other people who feel differently. And if we allow them to be taken away you will only be taking away a person's own choice, which is something we all should strive not to do. Also, just who would be left to decide what material should be removed and what material shouldn't? Is there really one person who could make such a choice for everyone? Also there is no way everyone could agree on what material should be removed, so by trying you would just be providing something more for everyone to argue on. I believe that if not everyone can be satisfied then why bother. Another reason why certain materials shouldn't be removed from libraries is that by removing certain materials you would be interfering with education. Books, movies and other such things are used for learning even whether people realize it or not, and the more opportunities a person has to learn the better. And who are we to decide what a person decides to educate themselves about? There have in fact been times in history when people in charge have wrongly decided that the public should not be educated or know about certain things and it was wrong then and it would be even more wrong now in our modern society. A society that is based on learning and knowledge, a society that in no situation should hinder a person's ability to learn. Also I realize some people argue that for young children some materials are better left unviewed, but that's where parents come in. It's their responsibility to decide what their children read or see and not anyone else's. And so there is no reason why anyone should interfere with a parent's choice as long as it is in agreement with the law. These are the reasons why I think libraries shouldn't be allowed to decide what materials and subjects are put on their shelves. For some decisions no one can make to satisfy everyone and to be in the right. Therefore it is better that such things are left up to the person themselves.
400	3377	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines and ect. should be removed, unless if it has nudity or a lot of cussing in the books because some books and movies are bad to show little kids. But I think we should have anything that teaches you something in the library. Plus people have to do reports and homework on some books, and if it's about something with a little cussing and kinda graphic it should be ok. I think if the library has these kind of books, movies, music and magazines they should let you if you are a certain age or have a note from a teacher that you need that book, or some kind of rule that lets you choose any kind of book but with permission. The library's would have more people going if they had more books and better ones. Because most of the things that people like is in the books or movies that the library wont have. So it just depends on the situation. There is a lot of offensive things out there, it doesn't mean you can keep it away from people. They will find out anyways sooner or later. I think it's unnecessary for the libraries to do that. I always hate when I try to get something when you find out you have to be a certain age or older or have an adult with you. Plus some people don't have computers or internet access, so they can't look up things easily. They have to drive down to the library to look something up and if you are lucky they might have the thing you are looking for at the library, but if they don't that sucks. So that's my opinion about having offensive things on the shelves, and ultimately, it seems better to allow access with some guidance rather than outright banning materials.
401	3378	2	3	People believe that censorship is important in libraries. They believe that things should not be released if they have a bad subject matter. They feel that it is sending a bad message to children and teaching them horrible things to do and say. I disagree with them on this and these are the reasons why. I feel that books/music/movies/magazines shouldn't be taken off the shelf is they have cuss words inside, i feel that they should continue to sell them even if they have bad words inside. I feel this way because there are a lot of horrible things in this world. Children have to learn that, and I feel like cussing or anything of that subject matter isn't that big of a deal there is so much more to worry about than a couple of bad words children read and listen to. I listen to music that has cuss words on the inside and I also read books with bad words and it doesn't influence me in any kind of way. So we shouldn't always try to control everyone we should just let them be on the shelves and let them or their parents decide if it's inappropriate or not. In conclusion I feel again that they should be on the shelves and people should be allowed to listen/read whatever they want to. If it doesn't harm anyone or themselves then let it go on and happen, let them do what they want to. Ultimately, restricting access based on subjective criteria like language sets a dangerous precedent for limiting intellectual freedom.
402	3379	2	3	Dear @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3 it @MONTH1 concerm; I'm writing to explain that @MONTH1 students are tired of students in their school not returning books to their school library. Many students have reports due on a book that a fellow classmate didn't return, creating significant challenges. Many students either forget they have a book out or are even past due, which makes it hard upon the student who is trying to do a report. If the books, music, magazines, etc., are not returned, people should be punished more than just having to pay an overdue fee. I have witnessed a lot of students who didn't want to turn in the books they checked out. We, the junior class at my high school, had a term paper that required books, newspapers, internet access, and magazines. Luckily, the senior class turned in all of their books, newspapers, internet resources, magazines, etc., that they used on their term papers, and we, the junior class, were able to succeed on our term paper. But many juniors still haven't returned the materials they have used. The teachers have threatened them with overdue fees and/or having to pay for the lost materials. I see that having to pay an overdue fee and/or having to pay for the lost materials doesn't bother them. Even though teachers make them pay, future classes will have to struggle and go out and purchase books, magazines, etc. The classes that have to take @CAPS4 @NUM1 next year and do their term paper @MONTH1 might not be able to succeed. It is unfair that they have to worry about whether they will have the materials they need to succeed and do their term paper. I think if the schools took time out and got parents involved, they wouldn't have as many students who didn't follow rules. Students think that their teachers can't tell them what to do; maybe if their parents were involved, they would follow directions and turn in their books, magazines, etc. In conclusion, if someone wants to take a book, they should provide a lot of their personal information as well as their school name. If people don't return their books, there won't be anything left for other people to use. So I say everybody does have the right to use the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., to their advantage; we should just try to remember to return them for other students as well, ensuring resources are available for everyone.
403	3380	2	3	No, I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the shelves in libraries if they are found offensive. You have the right to either read what you see or keep moving and read what you want to. Certain books, movies, magazines, etc. shouldn't be removed just because someone else doesn't like it. If someone of a certain belief sees something offensive to them or their religion, then they have an option to not read or look at it. Something that someone might find offensive might be interesting to someone else or they might have to do an report or project on it. There's no need to discrimanate against a book or movie just because a certain religion group or someone as an individual doesn't approve of it. It's an public library that has materials on display for the public! Any and everybody can come and read any and everything they please. A library is open to the public which means people of differenrent races, beliefs, religions etc., is going to come through and it's a possibilty that they're going to see something offensive or that they don't like. They have the option of either picking it up and reading it or the option of not paying it any attention and ignoreing it. The choice is theirs to either let someone elses's opinion actually bother them or not let their opinion matter at all and just keep doing their own thing. People have to be strong enough to rise above all the negetivity and keep doing thier thing and keep believing in what they believe in. It doesn't matter if someone hates or have hateful things to say about you or your perticular. Don't pay them no mind at all. I know you think censorship should be in public libraries, but that isn't fair to the people that are maybe being offended but they don't have to read it if they don't want to. They need to learn that in life there's going to be people that don't like. Even people have hurtful or hateful comments to say about you. Learn to be strong enough to stand tall in what you believe in and don't let haters or other peoples opinions bring you down. Ultimately, the freedom to choose what we consume and believe is paramount, and libraries should remain a bastion of diverse perspectives, even those that may challenge or offend some individuals.
404	3381	2	3	I do not think that books should be taken off shelves just because it's offensive or because others don't like it. If everyone took the books, music, and movies off the shelves that they didn't like, then all that would be left would be empty bookshelves. I believe that the library has a right to keep whatever they want on the shelves. Some @MONTH1 say that the library has inapproprite books to check out, or they don't want their kids to pick up a book they don't like and read it. I think that's why the library has the shelves marked in sections for example, adult, young adult, children, and referance. I've never seen a book that was offensive to me in a libray, which brings me to another point. Everyone has a opinion, if a book is offensive to you it might not be offensive to someone else. For example say that you saw a book on animal mating and you thought it was a bad book for the libary to have because, little kids might pick it up. Well that is your opinion because, if a biology teacher seen a book like that then they might want to check it out. Another thing is that the library has certain book for a reason. Say that there is a book in the library that is about slaves, this book might be offensive to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 but, this book is there to inform people about slavery. What is offensive to some isn't offensive to others. In conclusion, I believe that books should not be taken off library shelves just because it is offensive to you. Everyone just has to remember that people have their own opinions about things and you just have to deal with it. That's why I think that books should not be tooken off shelves. Some people may disagree with a book's content, but removing it limits access to information and diverse perspectives.
405	3382	2	3	There are people in the world who might be offended by various types of literature, movies, music, or etcetera. I understand this, but I don't think they should be banned just because someone else doesn't agree with it. Other people might like it or they might like it themselves if they give a chance. Before you go saying that you don't like something maybe you should give a chance. Maybe try looking at a a few pages of a book you once heard about, even if the premise seems unappealing at first. Watch at least one or two episodes of television show. Before you make an ultimate decision about something, give it a chance first.  Some people don't some media because it goes against their beliefs. If this is the case then just ignore it. If you don't like certain type of music don't listen to it. Maybe it is a movie your not particularly fond of then don't watch it. There is no need to actively campaign against something that simply doesn't suit your personal tastes.  In conclusion, people should learn to give some things a chance. They should also shouldn't get rid of something just because they themselves aren't fond of it or find it offensive. That said, I don't believe that certain media should be banned, as individual preferences should not dictate what is available to everyone else.
406	3383	2	3	For many students it is hard to compose essays in a public school's library. Acquiring the necessary information is comparable to finding a needle in a haystack. This is not due to the lack of funding or even the quality of teachers and staff. No, neither of these problems is the cause behind many students' inability to compose thought-provoking essays and analyses over a myriad of topics. This is due to the extremes in censorship that are being placed on libraries and schools in general. Many of the relevant topics and materials needed to truly understand our constantly changing world are being removed from the grasp of those who will go on to lead this new world. Some prime examples of this tyranny on knowledge is the removal of books such as *Huckleberry Finn*, *To Kill a Mockingbird*, the *Bible*, and many other classical works. Each of these, according to many parents, has good reason to be removed from our libraries. *Huckleberry Finn* promotes discrimination and racial supremacy along with being written by what some critics have pegged as one of humanity's most vile of creatures. *To Kill a Mockingbird* uses racial slurs that are not appropriate to be in the hands of our young children. The *Bible* violates the separation of church and state. Many other classical works reference racism, drugs, murder, sex and use rampant profanity. All of these are valid reasons as to why a parent might advocate for there to be censorship of our libraries. These reasons, as well meaning as they might be, are no longer good enough to be valid in today's changing environment. Many of the books that have been recommended to be removed show us an unfiltered view of a time period from a point of view that did not belong to the 'victor' of the social battle. As we know, 'history is written by the victors.' While it is good that the Union won the Civil War and helped abolish slavery it is still important to realize that we still cannot remove the viewpoint from our centers of knowledge. To forget is to remember at another time. That time is when we repeat the same mistakes again. For the parents who also want to save the innocence of their children by forbidding these books from libraries need to realize that the media has been pumping these forbidden images to their children more than books have. To censor our libraries is to cripple our children from the knowledge they need to fully understand our shadowed and fragmented world, and because of this we do our children a great disservice. Just because we try and close our eyes to the realities of the world does not mean that they don't exist; it is better to see and understand than to enter the world blind and dumb.
407	3384	2	3	Should offensive material be removed from the library? I think no, and there are many reasons as to why I disagree with this idea. Many books, movies, and magazines are not meant to offend people, but just to let the reader know how the author feels. I think that the books, movies, magazines, etc. should stay on the shelf because if they are removed what are we left with? Seems like all that would remain would be the dictionary. I think that when Katherine Paterson said, 'Children or any other children have taken off the shelf' that she was making a big mistake.  So what seems to be offensive to people? Topics such as gossip and politics are a gold mine for authors in the present day. Yet people find these topics to be offensive, probably due to that person's background. If someone finds a read to be offensive, then they should stop reading and that be it. Instead, people decide to go on a rampage against that magazine or whatever they read and want it banned for life from others to read. Readers have the choice to read whatever they want and if they disagree with that subject, just move on with their lives.  At the library I attend, many people of different shapes and sizes walk through the door every day. Many of them like a different subject than the others, so it's common to find everybody reading about a different topic. Sure, someone here and there does not agree with an author, but they never decide to go crazy about it. Instead, they just go pick a different read to enjoy for themselves. People read what they want to so they can enjoy it, not to bash the author for his writing.  In my own reads, I have found at times stuff I disagree with. Instead of going off the deep end and getting all excited about it, I choose to think about where the author is coming from and try to understand his side. On the other hand, some movies are meant to be for one type of audience when instead another audience sees the material. This still should not get movies or whatever the material is banned from the library. When on the box it says rated for teenagers and up, that means it is not for a four year old to watch and their parents get mad at them for it. If people followed what the box says and listened to the guidelines, then there would be no problem.  I disagree with a certain person when she said that some books, magazines, movies, etc. should be removed from the library. People have the right to read anything and to see anything they want, and if they disagree well they should just deal with it. In my own experience, I have not found there to be a problem in my community library with people wanting content removed. Only when people start consistently following guidelines and reading the boxes, and still disagree, will we have something to discuss then. But until then, we should keep our nation's libraries the way they are today.
408	3385	2	3	There are big debates today over whether or not certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are found offensive. Plenty of arguments are made from maybe somebody's own experience, observations, and/or reading. I have read plenty of people's concerns regarding this issue, and there are some valid points to be made from both sides of the story. No matter what your opinion on this issue is, there will always be someone who opposes it. You see censorship of offensive language on television, but here is my take on whether or not censorship should take an effect on books, music, movies, magazines, etc. The first point that I would like to make about censorship is that people all across the world have come in contact with something that they might have thought to be offensive. When kids are old enough to understand what other people are talking about, they will come in contact with things that they take in offense at some point in life. I know from my own personal experience that you will see things that people think should be censored. Although I come from a religious family who does not like to offend anyone, I am old enough to realize that not everything in life is going to work out your way all the time. When you honestly think about it, you cannot censor out things that you hear in person, so why censor things in certain materials? The second point I would like to make about censorship is that no matter how much you try to censor certain materials, people will still find a way to take things offensive. There are certain things in life that you cannot control, and being insulted or offended is one of them. Even the most popular man or woman on the planet has been offended at least once or twice. It isn't about trying to censor every little thing that might be offensive to some people. Maybe it is about the people learning to deal with a little criticism. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work i abhor---then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This is a quote from Katherine Paterson that makes a big statement. Almost every well-written book that you will find on the shelf has something that should be censored. What would those books be without those statements? To conclude this debate on censorship, plenty of arguments have been made about the views of censorship. Many observations, personal experiences, and/or readings have been done by many different people. Truth is, there will always be people who disagree on this subject, but that is just the way things are. We may never know who is actually right or wrong about this topic. We do know though, that judging form the previous points above, it is very unlikely that certain materials will be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive, suggesting that tolerance and critical engagement might be more effective approaches.
409	3386	2	3	Have you ever imagined a world without movies or music to entertain you? A world that has no books to read or magazines to inform you upon the latest gossip and fashion? Well, if items are banned from being seen or read then there will be no creativity in the world, there will soon be no books or magazines to read, no music to listen too, and no movies to watch, and you will not be able to express yourself or your opinions. I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. If the world is left without certain materials there will be no creativity. Everyone will be forced to think the same thoughts if they can't learn about other thoughts that are portrayed to be offensive. No one can read about a topic that they are interested in if it is banned, this will cease creative thinking by not allowing people to think differently. In the process of deciding what books are offensive and which are not offensive, all books will eventually be eliminated. Certain topics aren't liked by everyone and, as Katherine Paterson says, '...if I have the right to remove that book... so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Paterson is exactly right too; if one person has the right to remove a book, so does everyone and this will cause everyone to take off that book that they dislike so much. Also, everyone likes different kinds of books and different topics, and this will cause less self expression because if someone doesn't like books about cats, dogs, birds because they think it is offensive to animals, then there will be no books about cats, dogs, birds on the shelves for anyone to learn about it. Everyone will turn out to be the same if they can't express themselves or their opinions. If a certain topic is banned for being discovered as a offensive topic then this will result in the thought being banned. If you can't read or watch a topic you shouldn't be able to think or talk of the topic either because you will offend someone. Also, if people can pick what books can be in a library, that will eventually be transferred over into other areas, such as clothing, food, thoughts, etc.. Eventually everyone will be wearing the same clothes, eating the same food, and thinking the same thoughts. I do not believe that certain materials should be exterminated from the shelves if they are found offensive. If specific materials are banned: creativity will be eliminated from our lives, eventually all materials will be banned, and we will all be the same by the lack of self expression. If you haven't ever thought about a world without books, moves, music or magazines; I hope you have learned how cruel and boring the world would be without all of those materials, concluding that diverse expression is vital for a vibrant and understanding society.
410	3387	2	3	Any one has the right to anything. Right to speak freely; to watch what they please; and so on. The censorship on the media depends. People who like that sort of thing can go to a place where they can buy censorship and un censoredship items. Every place these days has censored books, cd's, video games, ect. But then they also have uncensored items. For those parents or people who disagree with what is shown on the shelf. Also on television parents complain about what's on TV, well there is a channel button and you can change the channel. Or even in todays technology you can block that channel from ever being watched. No body ever said that they had to buy what the person in front of you is buying. People have the right to chose what they want to buy, wheather its censored or not. Say or do as they please as long as it's with in the rights of laws. Its all about your style and what you let your child see. Personally, I agree. Its not as easy to keep children from the volgure things in the new technology. They go to a friends house and that childs parents don't care and let there child watch anything from R-NC-17 rated. The most you let your child watch is G. Its hard to keep a child sheltered from what you'd perfer them not to see. But what people have to realise is that there going to find out one way or another. Also a child who is sheltered will go to the extremes to find out whats on the other side of the railroad tracks to get a taste of the water, to see what they have been missing out on. Childeren will be childeren and they will sneak behind your back and do what they want to because they never knew what it was like in the first place. Any one has the right to anything, you as a person chose not to allow your child you have a 13 year old rated game, but his 16 year old friend does have it. Remeber hes going to play it at his friends house. Everybody has a different taste on censoreship. Some think everything should be a little cleaner others think different. So thanks to both sides, stores sell to you what you perfer, thereby catering to individual choices and preferences.
411	3388	2	3	Freedom of speech allows us to read, write, and listen to what we want, albeit with some limitations. I believe all books should remain accessible. As Americans, we possess the freedom to express ourselves without fear of reprisal. However, we should also consider the potential impact of our words and actions, taking responsibility for any harm caused. While I generally support open access, I agree that certain books promoting ideas detrimental to our country, such as those related to terrorist groups or excessive drug and alcohol use, should be removed to protect our youth. Our youth are heavily influenced by media, shaping their behavior, appearance, emotions, and interactions. Freedom of speech is a right, but we must exercise it responsibly, being mindful of the potential consequences of our words, as they could ultimately affect us. Therefore, while freedom of expression is vital, a degree of caution and consideration is necessary to maintain a healthy and productive society.
412	3389	2	3	People should not take all the books out of the library, because other people would probably like to look at those books also. If people start taking all the books out, all the books will be gone. So that would mean there would be no books for people to look at. So that's why there should be a law that you can only have a book out for a given period of time. That would help to keep all the books in the library.  So if people just start taking the books from the library, there won't be any books left in the library to check out. So there needs to be a law that says that you can check out a certain number of books at a time and how long you can have the books for. If you don't bring the books back in a certain amount of time, you will be charged a fine. The amount will build up every day you don't bring the books in. Also, if you don't pay the bill, you don't get to check out books until you pay the amount. So that would be a good idea for people not to steal or take the books.  About the books, movies, and magazines that are in the library, all the books, movies and magazines should stay on the shelves. Because if you take one out, you should take out all of them. Because everyone needs to see these things in life, even if it has something bad, like a movie or a magazine, it should stay on the shelves. If a book, magazine, or movie gets taken off the shelves, all of them need to be taken off the shelves. Just because it's not fair to their author, because they took time to make whatever they did. If you get them mad, they'll stop making books for me and you to read.  So that's what I think about the things you should do if you try to take books off the shelf in the library. But if it's something really, really bad, maybe you should get it taken off the shelves at the library or anywhere they sell that book, movie, and magazine, to protect the community from harmful content. Ultimately, libraries should strive to balance access to information with responsible management of their collections.
413	3390	2	3	
414	3391	2	3	"""Don't you dare say that word!"" That is exactly what I said to my brother after he had read the front cover of a magazine in the library one afternoon. Personally, I am an advocate of not saying curse words. Yet, my brothers are influenced by things, such as the media, to say them. Should we allow the media to sprinkle words like this on to magazines and books? Or should the items containing these things be removed from the library's shelving units? Magazines are one of many ways that we get the latest gossip on the most interesting scandals. They also appeal to a lot of people across the world. Most of those people are teenagers of age. Libraries will most often place the magazines on the shelf so that they can rake in some adult costumers. Most of the content of the magazines are pictures of half dressed women or men and explicit language on the covers these days. Should that be the new normal? I personally don't think so. I enjoy reading. I personally think that reading is better than sitting on the couch and watching mind numbing television. But, the material of some books have gotten to be where every other word is a curse word. Or they contain degrading scenes that no one should have to read. It used to be that books were read to learn something new, or to open your mind to a new culture or piece of information. In these times, though, it seems arduous to come across a good book that is like the classics. As though day by day, we are replacing the majestic words of authors for common words that anyone can use. Replacing such books like these on the shelves for anyone to read isn't right. It shouldn't even be allowed. With electronic devices such as the MP3 player and so on, most of the music comes from online sites where you purchase the song directly. Most parents don't even know half the songs that the children buy, especially when they do buy it at home. With internet in many libraries kids can plug in their device and buy songs with offensive language or graphic material without anyone knowing. Why don't the librarians put restrictions on the sites? The answer is that they can't. And, even if they did children would find a way to get around the restrictions. So, personally I think that they should remove the availability of being able to download and purchase music at the library.Or take out the awful language all together in songs. Because the language that they use is not needed. Although times are constantly changing and things are different than they used to be, with a little help we can restore it to where it used to be. Kids using such foul language is an issue that needs to be taken seriously. From my own experiences I know that it is a growing problem. But, maybe if we put censorship in libraries then some or most of the problems can disappear. From magazine articles, books, and even songs explicit language and graphic scenes are almost everywhere. So, speak up and talk to someone about the idea, for it might just start a revolution and begin to make a positive impact."
415	3392	2	3	Everybody does not have the same opinion on censorship. Some people don't like books and movies with profanity in it, but some other people do. Also somebody does like the scary mystery books and movies, but others do not. I think all movies, music, and books are acceptable. I can understand why some people do want to remove some movies or books from the libraries. They want to because they are inappropriate, but the thing is, they are not inappropriate to everyone. A lot of people like the books and the movies with profanity in them because it brings out the real in the book. Personally I think that some magazines need to just stop being made. For example; PLAYBOY magazines are horrible to me. There is nothing but nude women in there. I say that the women don't respect themselves enough to cover up, but there are other opinions. Others do think it is creative and beautiful how the women look in the magazines, and it isn't just magazines it's movies also. More and more movies are advertising sex and drugs in their movies. Everybody has their own opinion on censorship and everybody can not get what they want. I think if you are offended by a movie, music lyric, book, or a magazine don't read or watch it; at the end of the day, it's a personal choice.
416	3393	2	3	Should certain materials be removed from your public library? Not everyone has the same views as each other. What might be offenses to you might be enjoyable to someone else. I personally don't believe that anything should be removed from a library, just because something you might not like someone could really enjoy. If you don't want to learn about something you shouldn't take that away from others who do. I think that if they do start removing things from library shelves they should still be allowed to be viewed to those who want to. Even if you just put them away would be better than taking them out of the library completely. More and more books are banned everyday, and I personally don't think that's fair to the growing generation who don't get to enjoy the things the old generation have. So I believe that no books should be removed from library's, as censorship limits access to diverse perspectives and knowledge, which are essential for an informed and open-minded society. If you don't believe or enjoy something doesn't mean someone else won't, therefore, libraries should maintain a wide array of materials to cater to all interests and viewpoints.
417	3394	2	3	What is appropriate in libraries these days? The opinions differ throughout the variety of different people across @LOCATION1 communities. Censorship has taken a turn in public libraries, but it has still been strictly forbidden from school libraries. Personally, I think that there is a difference between vulgar and inappropriate items in a public library versus a school library. A public library is a place for anyone and everyone to come and find an item that they are interested in. As we all know, everyone is different and have their own interests, so they should be able to find the book, music, etc. for them. The problem is, how do the libraries keep these uncensored objects out of children's hands? The answer should be simple. For thought, maybe all public libraries should be broken up into sections, each with their own subject matter. These different sections could include Children's, @CAPS1 YOUNG ADULT, and many more different titles. This set up is often used in well known book stores and libraries such as '@CAPS2 BARNES AND NOBLE and @CAPS3 BOOKS A MILLION' and '@CAPS4 THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS'. Overall, censorship in public libraries does not need to be as strict as school libraries. School libraries are a whole different idea. School libraries are made to help assist the students' academic achievement, nothing more and nothing less. However, I also think that the content in the school libraries also depends on the maturity of the students. For example, elementary and middle school libraries should have a stricter censorship than high school libraries. The students in high school should be mature enough to handle uncensored material without creating a huge scene, like we all know younger students would do. I have personally seen and witnessed a few so called 'inappropriate' books on the shelf at my high school library, but the readers of the book have been mature about reading it. I believe that some offensive and vulgar items can be interesting and educational. It is all a part of growing up. The censorship in our libraries today vary from each library to the next. School libraries and public libraries are completely different places of literate and media content. I think that it is a person's own personal decision dealing with which library they go to. If a family with young children want to go to the library, the parents need to choose the appropriate areas in the building to search for the children. Therefore, there should be no problem in running across a 'bad' book. The author, @PERSON1 RAY BRADBURY, states, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf... And then we have no books left on the shelf for anyone.' Thus, striking a balance between access and age-appropriateness is crucial to ensure libraries remain valuable resources for all members of the community.
418	3395	2	3	The Author should be the judge on whether or not they want there book censored. I believe that libraries shouldn't have to take out books with offensive language. If the author likes how it was originally made, then that's how they would like to present it. It would be taking away a Right in the FIRST AMENDMENT. If you were to write a book and somebody says you can't put a certain word, that isn't up to the public to make a decision.  It's almost like rewriting history. It would be like having someone take out a word in the CONSTITUTION. If any word is changed it is a incorrect CONSTITUTION. It just changes the entire subject. You cannot reword what's been written.  Public views are starting to take over the world. Instead of letting the facts be the facts, people want to adjust things so it is less offensive. Next thing you know there will be a replaced word for slavery. Slavery is a strong, bold word that represents a horrible thing. If somebody switched that word it could lead to it happening again. I say with all my heart that people need to respect what has been written and leave it that way or don't read it, because altering an author's work diminishes its intended impact and meaning.
419	3396	2	3	First of all, I don't believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive; that question should never be asked. There are many people out there who read and listen to things that you might not like at all. When I first saw this question, I answered to myself that if all people thought the same way, this world would be boring, and I answered that there should not be any books or music removed from any shelves because we all don't like the same things or do the same things. I know that there are many different kinds of things that people do because they love doing them, and some don't do those kinds of things because they really don't like or don't care about them. This answers the question about removing books, music, or magazines from shelves, even if the article, book, music, etc., says something offensive to other people; that is not a reason to remove stuff. There are things that you enjoy doing and things that you enjoy reading, listening to, and looking at that other people don't like or hate. Not only because you don't like something should people stop doing those things or stop buying those things. No, you shouldn't just care for yourself or do whatever is right for you. If you are a good person that wants to be someone in the future, don't just care about you; care about others too because you'll need those people or those books in the future whenever you're falling down. In my conclusion about this article, I think that people should not remove anything from any library, even if it's found offensive to other people; those things help others in life to do what they really want to do, while others are getting hurt by those offensive things that are written on a little piece of paper. Hopefully, this helps you all think about and change your decision about this case, and I hope you all make the right decision that would not affect anyone in general. Thank you for taking your time to read what I really think about removing articles from libraries, and I firmly believe that maintaining a diverse collection, even with potentially offensive material, ultimately benefits society by fostering critical thinking and tolerance.
420	3397	2	3	One person's strong negative opinion affects everyone else, which doesn't seem logical or fair. A library is a sanctuary for people to read their favorite books for free, containing books from all types of genres. There is a book for everyone in the library; it's a matter of finding it. Therefore, finding a book offensive or unsuitable does not give one the right to take that privilege away from everyone else. Books have a way of putting our mind at ease, whether that's because it's an escape or measured on how enjoyable it is to read. Books found offensive to one person could have a completely different impact on the next reader; some people even find the books relatable. For example, if there was a scene that one reader thought was too graphic or horrific for other readers, there might be someone out there who would find this scene enjoyable because they can relate to it. People who aren't capable of relating to such a scene would only find it as inappropriate and try to remove it from another's reach. One person's opinion is not of any more importance than the next person's. The book '@CAPS1' is a professionally written, fictional novel that has been praised for its quality, hence the numerous awards won. Although, this book contains a rape scene and numerous other inappropriate events that this woman was subjected to throughout her life. Even so, it is still on the list of suggested college-level reads for Psychology, Sociology, and English classes. It is disappointing to think that people nowadays focus on the graphic scenes in a novel, versus the exceptional writing style. If all readers were able to look past the surface among these scenes, fewer books would be contemplated on shelf removal. One person's negative interpretation of a novel affects everyone else's right concerning the censorship in libraries. Readers are fully warned beforehand of the maturity of the contents. The books are ranked, critiqued, summarized (back cover summary), and even sorted in a library. If one finds a book offensive, look in a different section. Books are sorted by genre for that reason as well; different genres appeal to different people. This applies to the maturity of the reader as well. Books are sorted according to what appeals to what age. If you find a book offensive, instead of having it removed from the shelf altogether, look in a section for younger people, or a different genre completely. If someone finds the book offensive, the fault is not of the book being there, but of the person being in the wrong section. The main problem concerning book censorship in libraries is not the content, but how the interpretations differentiate towards such content. On this issue, the other readers' opinions on specific books being removed are being significantly overlooked. For one to complain about a book's contents automatically gives someone else the right to protect the book's contents. For libraries to remove books in order of censorship is viewed as favoritism and is completely against the rights America has stood for; therefore, we should strive to be more open-minded and inclusive in our reading habits and allow others the freedom to explore diverse perspectives, even if they differ from our own.
421	3398	2	3	Do you feel that some material should just not be allowed in libraries? Censorship in libraries are a touchy subject. Many people with young children believe that some books should just not be allowed in the libraries, while others believe that because it is a book, no matter what, it should be allowed to be in the library. Who knows, someone may need to write a paper over that certain 'touchy' book. I think, personally, that as long as the book is in a proper section, it should be okay for a person, of the right age, to be able to get that book or other material. The libraries should have a certain area for children's books and another area for adult or teenage level reading or material. This way, there is a less likely hood that a young child will end up getting a book with material for an adult or teenager. The library in the town that I live in has a clearly marked area for children and teenagers. This way, young children are not going to be looking for their favorite book with a book over something many adults should not even be reading. If people are concerned about someone being to young to read or view the material, the library can also put an age restriction on the material. This way anyone who is under the age limit will not be able to get the material. The people who are of proper age will be able to get the material, however. Libraries are very important sources for studing in many people's lives. If people did not have a library, they would not be able to research a paper, or something else, that they need to get finished. I feel if people do not like the material that they see in their local library, then they should just not look at it or borrow the material from the library. I do feel, however, that little children should not be given even the slightest chance to stuble upon a book with disturbing material. There, in my opinion, needs to be a room with said materials that children have, in no way, access to. This way, children are not able to access the material, but they are still able to go into the library without their parents feeling that the children may see something unsuitable for them. I feel that those people who love reading should be able to go into a library, and not be afraid of if they are going to see a book containing material they believe to be unsuitable. I also feel that if I need to research something that is deemed, by others, to be offensive, I should somehow be able to research my subject. Also, if I was the author of a book that was said to be 'bad,' i would not want my book to be taken away, so that no one could read it, or study and learn from it. I do not think that censorship is something that people should take lightly. We all have the freedom of speech, so why not let the authors of the materials have that same freedom. There are procautions that parents and people who do not want to see this literature can take. Total censorship, I feel, would not allow for people to broaden their minds. If people just take procautions, there is no need for total censorship of materials, that someone worked very hard on for everyone to see. With proper precautions and designated sections, libraries can maintain their role as vital resources while respecting diverse viewpoints and protecting younger readers, ultimately ensuring access to information and fostering intellectual freedom.
422	3399	2	3	Libraries should not remove a book from the shelves just because someone didn't like it or finds it offensive. If there is a group of people that are interested in a book and want to read it more then once they will like telling a new person about it. Then if another student has decided they don't like the book and they don't want anyone else reading it because they find it offensive then I honestly believe it shouldn't be taking off the shelves. I think it would be different if everyone found the book offensive, but if it's just one or two people complaining then I don't think they should take it down and ruin it for everybody else. It's just a book and students should know just because it's there doesn't mean its directed towards them. I think they should overlook it.  If your playing some music, dacing around, and just having fun with it then thats good. Now, if there is cussing and talking about drugs and those sort of things in a song then don't play it in a school system or around someone that might be religious or against that kind of thing because they might not like it and think that your into that sort of things. They might not want to be around you as much. Show them respect and play something everyone can have fun with. So if the libary has this type of music it should be monitored as to who checks it out. It should be checked out by responsible adults.  Movies are something you have to look out for too. Movies already have ratings so this kind of helps for people to check them out and make sure the movie would be safe to watch. If your getting movies from the libary then I would think it would already been watched by an adult there to make sure it can be watched by a student or a child. I wouldnt want my little sibblings watching something that they didn't need to see or hear. The ratings are there to help.  You have to watch out for magazines too. You want a magazine that is going to be interesting and clean. Kids might not know what is bad from good, but you still have teenagers. You don't want kids seeing nudity, cussing, or drugs in any magazine. If I were to walk in a library and see those kind of things in a magazine I would suggest you to take it off the shelves. I would only suggest that so the kids will have a healthy thought about things. I wouldn't want them thinking about doing anything bad like they saw in the magazine. I'm just looking out for their safety.  Libraries might always need advice. They need to always have an eye out for things and make sure everything is clean and so that everyone can look at it, read it, or watch it. I'm glad we have these safety ideas for kids. I hope everyone has an eye out for these kind of things. I know I if I were to ever have children I would want them around something they understand and know, nothing bad and harmful. So thanks to libraries that have an eye out for things like this, helping to ensure a safe and enriching environment for everyone.
423	3400	2	3	People @CAPS1 Offensive by Libraries I think that libraries are sometimes offensive,but not all the time. It all depends on peoples different beilfs and thier culture. I can see where some things in the library are very offensive and where somethings are not offensive. I believe parents are more offended by things in the library ,because they don't want their kids to experience these things that are not the childs age. Movies that are at the library @MONTH1 be offensive ,because if a parent rents a moive for their child and gets home and puts in the @CAPS2. Then finds out that the moive they wasn't a kids moive ended up being an adults moive. Parents who don't want their kids to look at inporatiate things should not be suable for their childs age.One way to sovle this problem is to keep a eye on their child and make sure they don't go anywhere esle except the childrens area. This would sovle so many problems if parents would actually follow through with this it might work. Some parents bring their child up they way they want to. Also the parent or parents teach their kids that they don't need to go in any other area expect the one they are suppose to go in unless their parents tell them otherwise. I do get offensive sometimes when I go in the library, because they are some people who thinks it's funny to look at things just for fun not for any purpose. They make a big deal about and I don't like when people do that ,because it makes you think of the library as not such a place you wanna be at. If i was a person who got offensive by something that was on the shelf at the library I would pass it up and not pay attention to it. But some people would tell the people who are running the library that this certain thing on their shlef is very offensive to me and bothering me. If I had an issue with the library for some certian reason I would complain. Because complaining will more than likely do something about it. Instead,of not saying anything it won't get done or change it so it's not offensvie to others. I would let them know how I felt about a certain product in the library in a soft and calm manner. When you complain about something might as well complain in a nice way, because if you do then that person you are complaining to will be nice back. I know that everyone is not the same and feel the same about everything. But one thing is for sure is to keep on living life and don't let simple things about a library product offending you or bother you.You could not got to the library anymore if it's a problem or ignore the image that is offending you. There are so many ways to handle a situation like this it's just how you handle it. One way is to be respectful to people and people @MONTH1 be respectful back. Your attitdue has a lot to do with telling someone that something is offending you. If you can't get anywhere that way then just forget it and move on, ultimately choosing to focus on your own reactions and behaviors.
424	3401	2	3	I do not think books, music, movies, magazines etc... should be removed because they are offensive. There are books, movies, and music that offend everyone; if we took them all away we would have nothing. There's no reason for all that. That's why I say we do not take away offensive materials. First, if we took away all the offensive materials off the shelves, they would be empty, as would the library, the movie store, and everything else. If something like a book or movie offends you, I feel bad for you anyways, but just put it down and don't worry about it; there are plenty of other things to choose from. Second, I don't think we should remove offensive materials off the shelves because of what they mean to us. They show us the good and the bad, the right and wrong; that's what books are for. Books are important to this world, as well as movies and magazines and such, but to some more than others. You can't get mad at a book or a movie, so just learn from them. For instance, say we did take away all the offensive materials; what is that going to do? Is it going to make the world a better place? I don't think so. I think we need stuff like that on earth to show and to teach us the way to be, to educate and inform. Materials deemed offensive can spark important dialogues and help us understand different perspectives. In conclusion, I do not think offensive materials should be removed. We would have nothing and the libraries, movie stores, and books would be empty. We would also be pretty misinformed about life, and unable to engage with challenging ideas, so we should not remove offensive materials off the shelves.
425	3402	2	3	In the world, there are just some things that our children should not be exposed to. I believe that the media such as music, magazines, and movies set a high bar for the individuals in our society. I highly disagree with what the media feeds to our minds as to the way our looks and lifestyle should be. The library is a place where most children go to feed their imaginations with colorful books with morals; but the library is also where adults go to free their minds of work and to escape many of life's responsibilities. Most children from ages @NUM1 to @NUM2 draw a curious mind to the very adult world and seek to find answers. Now the library is not a place where a child can recieve adult information right? Wrong! the library shelves are open to any and everyones advantage. A child can just as easily come across the wrong track to take ones innocence. Some parents in sociey believe that their neighborhood is a perfect harm free enviornment to raise children. Little do parents know, it is a very uncensored world and at anytime a child can learn of it's exsistance. The media draws it's attention to captivate our children. We have to watch what we let our kids watch, listen to, and read. For example, the girl in the magazine who just recently got a nose job because her nose was too big is feeding the idea to your eight year old daughter. She believes that she can recieve surgery to fix her big nose that the kids at school tease her about. Maybe your son listens to rap or rock music that condones the use of violence, drug, and alcohol use. He will think its ok to pick fights at school with other children or curse the teacher. Or the movie with the sex scene in it could give your child the idea to go out and practice what was taught. In our society, there should not be an image that our children should try and sustain. We should teach our children that life is better explored through @PERSON1's '@ORGANIZATION1' or through the wonderful adventures of 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2'. Parents should feed kids 'imagination' and not feed their 'image'. Life for our children should be about fun, knowledge, and life experience; but not everything that is on the shelves of our local library, as certain content could prematurely expose them to aspects of the adult world they are not yet ready to process, and ultimately, protection is key to nurturing childhood.
426	3403	2	3	Have you ever been to a library? Have you ever thought that some material from the libraries could and have been found offensive and wanted them to be removed from the library? I'm here to talk about the content of libraries and what we should do with them. Every time you walk into a library, you are surrounded with books and other learning or reading material. Yes this material is helpfull in finding things to pass the time or to help understand a certain subject, but some have been found offensive. Stories such as romance novels or vulgar horror and action stories have been viewed as innapropriet to some ages. These novels contain anything from brutal horror, to adult material, or foul language. Parents argue that these books should be removed from the libraries. I do not agree. I beleive that such books and novels can be a great help to the immagination of others and get the mind flowing. Yes i do agree that some novels are not age apropriate for young children, but that does'nt mean that they should be removed. I think that if people are so worried about their children reading these books that they should either go into the library with their child, or simply give the child a certain area that they are allowed to pick a book from. Another way of avoiding these wrightings getting into the wrong hands is to section off the more aggressive and adulterated books to a certain spot in the library and allow only age apropriate people inside, ensuring that young children do not stumble upon mature content accidentally. An age restriction of thirteen years and up would be a responsible decision. An age younger could be innapropriate for them, but any older and it could keep them from learning and expanding their mind to it's full potential. The point of this writing is to show that removing these books and novels from the libraries is not going to help anything; if anything it could hurt us by not allowing our minds to reach newer and higher limmets by learning and understanding the complexity of these novels, and so we must allow access while implementing safeguards. Sectioning off these novels in an age apropriate area or having parental discression will help to keep the age correct for the books that they get.
427	3404	2	3	Censorship in Libraries In our libraries there are a lot of books that are very helpful. There are also a lot of magazines, music, and movies. A lot of the movies are adult movies ,but they do have a kid section at a lot of the libraries. Most of the books, magazines, and movies are all reachable by little children. I have been to the library as a child and seen all the books there. When I went to the library as a kid, I went with my parents. We would go there and mainly go to the kids section. I can also remember going with my grandparents. I would read books or I would put a puzzle together or something. I cannot remember a time when I went to the library and seen something that was offensive. I've never been to the library and seen anything that seems offensive to me. I'm sure that there is a book or a movie somewhere in every library is offensive, but to give you an example of a personal experience is something that I cannot do. If the libraries do have books that are offensive, they do a good job hiding them from me and other kids. I havn't heard anything about people finding these kind of books in other books or magazines that I read. I tend to not read very many books about the world. I like to read biographys about sports players and types of books like that. Whenever I read magazines usually they are about sports or cars, so I don't read much about offensive things that are going on, if they are. If the libraries have offensive books, but no kids or people that shouldn't be reading them, than the library doesn't need to remove them from the shelves. Some adults come into the library looking for one of these books, so then they can ask and find them. So in my opinion, I think that the libraries shouldn't have to remove these books from the shelves, as long as they are not easily accessible to children and remain available for adults who seek them out.
428	3405	2	3	We see them. We read them. We gossip about them. Books that are found with inappropriate language, pages with the word 'sex' on them, disturbing thoughts and ideas, cuss words, it's all there, but yet they are still in our libraries. My views on censorship is that, yes, our libraries should be more modest and not have books on the shelves with these things in them. The books in libraries across the nation that have found and profane ideas in them, is one of the direct faults in our teenagers today. In my personal experience with this, I have come across books that have had inappropriate language in them. I have also read books assigned to me at school that have had descriptions of sex and bad language in them as a third grader. As a young boy, I would go home to my parents and show them the content of the book and how despiteful it was. I've always been raised in a Christian home and seeing these things not only in schools, but on the bookshelves in libraries I believe is uncalled for. I know that there are so many things that could offend people. Racism, sex, cussing, rules, religion, but you need to eliminate the main things. It is impossible to please everyone. These ideas in magazines, books, in movies, and even in music has changed the world upside down. Even when I was young, we were taught no cussing aloud, and yet you see this all the time in books. In America, of course we have the freedom to do what we want. Authors have the right to put profane language in their books, and even dirty ideas. However, libraries are not forced to keep this content in their libraries across the globe. I believe that we should keep the future of America in the back of our minds, that if we teach them this material, they are going to grow up in the world with no morals at all, and the world will become worse than it already is. In the quote by Katherine Paterson, I believe that she has made a strong point. If we take the books off of shelves, then our students, children, grandchildren won't be taught properly, and then there would be no education at all. However, I believe that from this quote even she agrees we in America fear what our children read. So yet, why do we keep these books in our libraries? I believe that if we take these certain books, magazines, movies, songs, and internet sites off the computers, and out of libraries and schools, teenagers wouldn't be traveling down the road they are. Today, the world has turned to a disaster. The kids we saw 20 years ago were on the right path. Now those same kids are smoking pot, having sex, getting girls pregnant, abortions, miscarriages, things that are not appropriate. And I truly believe that this content students read in schools and libraries across America has something to do with it all. It is now in the hands of the school board, whether our kids grow up to be the future of America, or the joke of America. We need this fixed. If we don't take action now, the harmful content will continue to influence our youth negatively, potentially leading to a society devoid of the values and morals we hold dear.
429	3406	2	3	Offensive literature, sexual content, disagreeable topics – books all have those things to someone somewhere. It would be impossible to get rid of all of the books that offended everyone and still have books left. There are many reasons why censorship is pointless and wrong. Censorship only causes curiosity. Censoring books could take away from learning. The real world is not censored so books should not be either. Censorship only causes curiosity. Young kids every day are told what to do and what not to do. Many people know that children are most likely to want to do exactly the opposite of what they are told to do. Being censored from things makes people want to rebel and learn the truth. No one likes to be told what they can and can not do. The same goes for being told what you can and can not read. No one wants the truth cut out of their reading materials, as it only fuels their desire to uncover what's hidden. Censoring books could take away from learning. In school children are required to read many different books in their english classes. Some books, depending on the teacher, have what some would consider offensive language and topics. What some people do not understand is that reading those things are a part of life. Reading foul language would not be any more offensive than if someone was to use the same foul language in front of you in real life. In fact, the real life situation would seem to be more offensive. If we are censored from these things how will we learn that they exist, stifling opportunities for growth and understanding? The real world is not censored so books should not be either. You can not go walking down the street and expect a loud beep to randomly play over someone's foul banter everytime they curse. When someone says something offensive in the real world you have to learn to deal with it appropriately and maturely. We can not cut out peoples offensive banter in real life so why should we do it in our reading material. Has no one ever heard of freedom of speech? That ammendment was created for a reason, to let people speak their beliefs. Everywhere we look today things are being censored and 'cleaned up' to make others happy who might be offended by whatever it is they are censoring. Sometimes it is appropriate for offensive language or topics to be written about. People need to be able to speak their minds and beliefs. But people also need to be able to have constructive criticism and be mature about offensive writing. Everyone will be offended in one way or another some time in their life by something they will read or already have read. It is just life, and censorship offers no real protection from that inevitability.
430	3407	2	3	"Books play a multifaceted role in human life, serving purposes from education and entertainment to various other needs. However, some books contain content that some readers find offensive. The question arises: should these books be avoided, discarded, or even removed from shelves altogether? There are arguments against removing offensive material, including the idea that individuals should learn to discern and avoid harmful content, that perceptions of what is ""bad"" are subjective, and that even offensive material has a right to exist.  The subjective nature of offense is a key consideration. What one person finds objectionable, another might find acceptable or even necessary. For example, some may object to strong language in a book, while others believe it is crucial for portraying a character's intense emotions or creating a realistic narrative. Similarly, descriptions of violence, while disturbing to some, might be seen as necessary for conveying the full horror of a situation to others.  Furthermore, individuals are typically taught to recognize and avoid potentially offensive material. If a reader encounters content they find objectionable, they have the option to stop reading. Just as one wouldn't knowingly choose an @CAPS1-rated movie when seeking family entertainment, readers should exercise discretion when selecting books. Resources such as online reviews and recommendations from others can help readers make informed decisions about content they might find offensive.  Even if material is deemed offensive by some, removing it from shelves is problematic because it imposes one person's opinion on everyone. If someone needs a book, they would be unable to obtain it because of its removal. If materials were removed based on individual objections, a decline in available reading material would occur, as anyone could claim offense, potentially exaggerating their reaction.  Therefore, materials should not be removed simply because they are deemed offensive. If everyone were to label content as offensive, the literary landscape would become barren. Individuals should not have the power to dictate the removal of books, as personal spite could influence such decisions. Ultimately, the question remains: should potentially offensive materials be removed from shelves? Given the subjective nature of offense and the importance of individual choice, the answer is no; books should remain available, allowing readers to make their own informed decisions."
431	3408	2	3	Every parent has their own opinion upon topics like this; but even if you were to censor out books, movies, music, etc., your child would still be allowed to find that book or movie on the internet uncensored. Yes, parents believe that having things censored will be better for their children, but children have much more technology and much more access to uncensored music. As each day goes by the minds of children become more and more curious as to what the world has to offer. The more parents keep their children away from things in life the more chance they have of their child sneaking out or just not being the person you thought they would be. Every person is their own person; I personally would say to just leave the books, music, movies, etc. on the shelves of libraries; children will find out anyways, whether it is from friends, or the media, because curiosity is a powerful motivator.  It's not to say that your child will become corrupt if listening to such music, but I believe that at a certain age parents should have talks with their children about stuff that is happening in the world, because children are not going to be children for long and you will not be able to control them forever. Open communication can help guide them.  Everybody was a child at one point in time and I am pretty such that most parents very much disliked when their parents would keep them away from things they wanted to do or maybe that they wanted to see, but life always is not fair and these are just one person's opinions.  Either way if you decide to take all the music and censor it out or if you do the same things to all the books and movies, etc. there will still be unhappy adults and unhappy parents. No matter what happens odds are is that children will find their way around these things, it never fails. There will always be some way your child can get around you, always going to be some way your kids will get past your rules; just think about it, if they disobey you once they will most likely do it again. It is in a child's nature.  So like I said before every parent and every person has their own opinion upon topics like such, me personally I say just leave it and lets the parents of these children handle it the way they would like to, because you can not please everybody, and ultimately, each family must decide what approach works best for them.
432	3409	2	3	Should books, music and movies be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Books, music and movies have a certain view set aside for the reader or viewer at hand. If someone has a different view of the text then they should not even be reading or viewing them, but to have books that are great be taken off of the shelves because they represent different views to someone else is unreasonable. People should give these things a chance because sometimes the non-original things just don't work. To have movies banned from the public because they are offensive is something that is just a way to control what we see and what we hear. Books, music and movies should not be taken from shelves for the fact that they teach us a lesson about life without it really happening to someone. Books are a way that people can express themselves without actually going out and hurting someone or something. Poetry, for example, gives the reader a feeling of what the writer was feeling when it was produced. Books that have political or social views on something should not be discriminated against because someone does not like the side that they chose or the way that the author presents it to the people. In novels, just because someone uses profanity does not mean that their message is any less clear. Their message might be that profanity is used too often or that the way that the next generation below them may turn for the worst, but it is not used to harm.  Music is a way that people can express their emotions without taking it out on the people that have hurt them or the people that they have hurt themselves. When someone uses profanity in a song, it is not specifically said at one person; it is used to say how bad they feel about what has happened to them that they need something to really show how they feel. Many people who hear these lyrics sang to them believe that the person is telling them that that really is how they feel when it's just a verse. Music should not be taken away because it is just words and they should not hurt someone, especially when it is only a way to express.  In movies, you see someone get shot, brutally murdered, or attacked, and it's already a horrible thing because someone died or because someone did not have a fair life. This violence shown on the screens in homes, movie theaters, and schools is shown to teach people what dangers are really out there; they are not shown to teach people other ways to severely injure another person although that is how people perceive them. Movies are about taking an idea and showing the world your idea; to show the world that this is what you are thinking and that this is how you feel about something.  To have this all taken away shows that the generations before us are scared of what it is that we can do when we are a whole or what we can be if we stand alone and say that we don't like something. Books, music and movies that are all based on something that is real should not be banned just because they show individuality; just because they have the decency to show us the truth in all the lies told to us by a higher person. These people most likely believe that there is a thing as a perfect life when there is not one, so when people show the way that things are, they get scared that their ideas of a perfect thing are ruined by those who know the truth. The censorship of only things that are truly vile should be censored, not the things that have nothing to do with the way that the communities are today, because it stifles creativity and the opportunity for diverse perspectives to be shared.
433	3410	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves, in libraries or any place else. I believe that if someone wanted to know more information about something the library or the museum should be able to provide it for them. Imagine if the libraries and the art gallery started putting these materials away; many people wouldn't bother to go to either. The museum, in my eyes, is a place that shows me where we have been, what we have been through, and things we have accomplished while we have been there. In the art gallery, could you imagine walking around touring, seeing nothing about your past? No, I couldn't. Even though things may seem offensive in one's eyes, it could be the history of another's. Many people nowadays rely on the usage of magazines, books, and music to get information from. I believe that everyone has a right to know what has happened in their past to have gotten to their future, so taking away information that may seem offensive to someone else isn't fair. I believe that we should keep all information in libraries, art galleries, art shows because everything has its own history behind it, and if we just cover it up we will never know. I myself would want to know, than not to ever have known, because understanding our history, even the parts that are difficult, is crucial for progress and a more informed future.
434	3411	2	3	I believe that certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from public libraries. What if a young child were to stumble across an inappropriate magazine? They would have the images stuck in their heads and could lead to unlawful decisions. There are many books and movies that aren't appropriate for most young aged children. I think that they should either be placed more appropriately or removed completely. Some people will take certain materials to be more offensive than others, but if read, the person might get angry or start to have bad thoughts. Personally, I think that most fictional books are entertainment only. They do not display actual happenings or thoughts for the most part. If someone reads them as offensive, they might just be taking it the wrong way. Most libraries have areas sectioned off for adults only, but they aren't monitored. So how would anyone know if a child was in this restricted area where they shouldn't be viewing this material? They wouldn't have the slightest clue.  I think that in today's society, most children already know about sexual graphics and whatnot, so why limit them to what they already know about? There are a lot of television shows and movies in the world that are much more graphic than books and magazines. Shouldn't they be banned too? The accessibility of these materials elsewhere complicates the library's role.  The world is exposed to offensive material every day. We just get used to all of it and do not take it the wrong way. But young children don't know better, so there is no guarantee that they won't take ideas from inappropriate viewings and use them. So maybe things do need to be taken off shelves, to protect the innocence and well-being of children who might be negatively impacted by certain content.
435	3412	2	3	Offensive libraries are where you know you are going to find something interesting to read, listen to, or even watch. Most people use libraries to find information on a certain topic; some of these topics are not always appropriate for certain age groups. I do believe that materials on any subject should reflect how people see the world now. Most kids go to the library and look to find books that interest them; sometimes they cross books about stuff they shouldn't know about yet. Libraries should be allowed to have anything on their shelf that they please but allow it to certain age groups. Imagine you were a little kid and you wanted to look up information on racing; you might have passed by many books about racism. As a little kid, you might not know what that is, but all you have to do is pick it up and read. That kid just went from reading about NASCAR to reading about racism and different races. I believe that books should be kept in order of age. Imagine a teenager goes into the library to look up a book; they should be able to go to a section for teens and get a book on their topic. In most libraries, there are topics such as sex, killing, and violent matters. Kids should not be allowed to view that detail until they are ready for it.  If I am at the library, I will always look for a book that interests me. My skills on choosing books for myself have changed since I was 10 or 11. Now that I am older and like to read, I read more books about action and mystery. I was at our hometown library and saw a 7-year-old kid looking at books about pregnancy and was shocked to see what he was reading after he put the book down. That same day, I came across a younger kid approaching his father with a book about sex and one about killing. When I saw this, I was surprised to see what was happening. I do believe that libraries should be able to showcase what they have but in certain age sections.  Kids visit the library all the time and are looking for books to strike their interest and will always find something different that they should not be exposed to. Libraries would have trouble containing what kids read, so they should expose all the different topics. If you're little and you're reading about these topics, you will then be more informed when you're just a little older.  Next time you visit the library, check and see what kids in your local town are talking and reading about. You will be surprised when a child approaches his parents with a book about sex. I think that all libraries should expose what they want, because they want to ensure knowledge to everyone, and age-based sections can help guide younger readers appropriately.
436	3413	2	3	I don't think anything should be taken off the shelves at the libraries; if it's educational to your child in a certain way, it should stay. Children can learn a lot from the books at the libraries, gaining knowledge and expanding their understanding. If you need help or answers about certain things, you can often find what you are looking for in a library, as they hold a wealth of information. You cannot get everything off the internet; some things you have to look up by opening a book, delving into the details provided. As I was growing up, I was able to get what I needed done for my school at the library, utilizing its resources for my studies. It's so many things at the libraries that's educational, you just have to know what you are looking for, exploring the diverse collection. For some of these adults, if you were having a hard time looking for what you needed at the library, do not assume the same for your child, as their experience may differ. Sometimes your children have a better time understanding than you did at their age, grasping concepts more readily. Parents, please don't take away the good things out of the libraries that could really help your child at times; these resources can be invaluable. If it was not helpful, they would have never put it in the library from the start, as libraries aim to provide beneficial materials. There are things that you would be better off finding in a book, because not everything is on the internet, ensuring accuracy and depth. So many scientists found their information in a book, because it's often easier to access and more comprehensive. You learn so many good things from libraries, broadening your horizons. The books and things in a library help you with so much research, supporting academic pursuits. Taking materials out of a library, I would have to disagree with, as it limits access to valuable resources for everyone. Therefore, preserving the diverse collection of library materials is crucial for fostering learning and intellectual growth for all.
437	3414	2	3	Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines, do not need to be removed from the shelves in libraries if they are found offensive. There are multiple reasons to back up this statement, including an accurate quote from author Katherine Paterson. People build their character through their reactions of how people treat them. For example, in life somebody might offend another person, but that does not mean the offender is going to disappear after doing so. How does this relate to libraries you might ask? Books and movies do not need to be taken off of shelves in libraries if they are found offensive because there are a lot of things in the real world that are offensive. It is your choice in what you want to read, listen to, or watch. Just because you might have the option of checking out something you do not think is appropriate or is offensive, does not mean you have to check it out. Some people might enjoy reading or watching things that are offensive. You might be wanting to argue, 'But I don't want my children being exposed to such offensive materials.' That is why most public libraries are split into children and adult sections. If you happen to come across an offensive book in the childrens section, then do not let your child check that out. It is as simple as that. Trying to take the book off the shelf or complaining about it would only take up more time. The quote, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us', by Katherine Paterson, is a perfect example to conclude the reasons why books should not be taken off the shelf. She is saying that if one person is allowed to remove a book, then anybody else would be able to have that ability as well. Therefore, a book that might not offend you at all could be taken off the shelf because somebody else does not approve of it. Eventually, there would be no books left. In conclusion, if there are books, music, movies, or magazines that offend you, simply do not check them out. You do not need to get rid of them because somebody else might want to check them out.
438	3415	2	3	No, I do not think that books and other materials should be taken off the shelves of a library if someone thinks it's offensive. Everyone has a different opinion on what books they like to read.  I think that if you don't like the book and think it's offensive that you shouldn't get the book and just leave it there because someone else might like that book and want to read it. Not everyone likes the same books, but every book in a library is there for a reason. The library screens all of the books that they get and wouldn't buy something if no one asked for it or if it wasn't a good book to have for their collection.  I think that everyone has a right to read what they like to read and that no one should have the right to take books off of shelves in a library because what if someone is looking for that book and the library is the only place that has it? Then where would people spend their time reading and enjoying the books that they have an interest in? If everyone could just pull a book off a shelf when they thought it was offensive there wouldn't be any books left on the shelves, and no one would have books to read. I also think that if you don't like the selection of books on the shelf that you shouldn't be looking in that section; go to another part of the library and look at the types of books that you like to read. There's something for everyone in a library, covering a wide range of topics and interests.  This is why I think it's not a good idea to be able to take books off of shelves; no one would have any books that they like to read if everyone did that when they saw something 'offensive', ultimately limiting access to diverse perspectives and knowledge.
439	3416	2	3	Some books might be better suited for personal ownership rather than library lending, while others require a more mature understanding, like history books about sensitive topics or books with strong language. School libraries, especially at the elementary and high school levels, should curate their collections to match the age groups they serve, and librarians can guide younger readers away from inappropriate material. Similarly, music, magazines, and movies should be age-appropriate, as young children don't need exposure to excessive profanity. Libraries are often organized into sections for babies, toddlers, pre-teens, teens, and adults to help people find suitable material. If a teen finds a book in their section that seems more appropriate for adults, they should be able to inform a librarian. While individual sensitivities vary, libraries shouldn't remove every book that offends someone, as that would be unfair to others, especially since no one is forced to check out a particular book, so a balance between access and appropriateness is key.
440	3417	2	3	"""Hey, what book is that? Let me see it, because I don't think I want you to read it because it is too graphic for a [age] year old boy."" This is what some parents might say to their child if they don't want them to read a certain kind of book or even a certain book. I feel that censorship is not needed in libraries, because either way, the kids will be exposed to something the parents don't want them to see sooner or later.  I do not believe that anyone has the right to remove anything from the shelves except the library. They can go ahead and complain that they don't want it there. But if the library has it, the library should be able to keep it there whether or not people don't want it there. I think the only real people that can remove a book from the shelves are the managers or manager if they agree with the patron. Other than those certain people, I don't think a regular person can remove anything from the shelves.  At the library I go to, they have any kind of book, music, movie, and magazine you want. Whether it is an adult content book to a rated R movie, they have anything, and they get new things every week. So if a person does not want a certain thing on the shelves they should not be able to by themselves take it from the shelves because what if another person wants to see the movie but they can't because a parent took it from the shelf because they did not want their kid being exposed to it. One time at my library I saw a verbal fight between a patron and the library manager; the patron did not want the book in the section it was in because they felt it was too provocative for a children's book. The manager refused to take it off the shelf because the library can have whatever books they want on their shelves. Another time I saw a person break a DVD because they thought children at the age their children were should not be allowed to see those kinds of movies. But breaking the movie is just putting other people that want to see it out because now they can't because it is broken.  To summarize everything, I do not think citizens should be allowed to remove anything from the shelves; only the managers of the library should be able to remove anything if they want, because ultimately, the library should be a place with access to a variety of information, and that access should not be dictated by individual patrons."
441	3418	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I strongly agree that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are young chirlderen that will pick up a book, movie and/or @CAPS3 DVD case, or even a magazine and read off whatever the front says. We @CAPS5't need younger childeren reading off whatever they know what to say. @CAPS7's already bad enough that they hear @CAPS7 it from family members or @CAPS2 people near them. The seller could also make an edited verison of the book, movie, @CAPS3 DVD, or magazine.  The sayings,'You @CAPS5't like @CAPS7 it, than @CAPS5't look.','@CAPS5't got anything nice to say, than @CAPS5't say anything at all.',and 'If you wouldn't want to hear @CAPS7 it, than @CAPS5't say @CAPS7 it.',strongly apply to this. The way this world is coming to, @CAPS7 they seems like they @CAPS5't really mind who sees their product, as long as @CAPS2 people are buying their product.  Now a days, @CAPS7 it seems like the younger the child is, the smarter @CAPS7 they'll be. If a four-year-old picked up a @PERSON1 Britney Spears @CAPS3 DVD case, saw a pretty much naked grown adult on the case doesn't put a good thought in their head. That child's gonna grow thinking, '@CAPS7's okay to be naked. @PERSON1 she did @CAPS7 it. Why can't I?'. Childeren learn more things from family and freiends, before they start learning the truth in school.  @CAPS7's just like you wouldn't want to take your child to the @CAPS8 strip club @CAPS9, half naked to naked woman just walking around freely. Not something a little five-year-old needs to see. Just like a little five-year-old doesn't need to hear cussing or using the @CAPS10 Lord's name in vien.  Having young childeren see, hear, say, think, or read things like that puts thoughts in their heads, making them think @CAPS7's okay to say whatever you want or to dress however they want, while they think @CAPS7's perfectly natural. Although, this @MONTH1 day seem like a huge wake up call to some parents, but @CAPS7's not normal. @CAPS7's not more normal than telling your kids that they were a mistake. Things like that shouldn't be said to/ near childeren.  Every parent wants the best for their child, they @CAPS5't want their childeren growing up in world that is full of bad nor do they want their childeren doing wrong. By letting companies sell their prodcut with half naked @CAPS2 people on the front cover of a magazine or @CAPS3 DVD case, or by selling books that talk about murding someone, hiding the body, and prays to @CAPS12 Satan that they @CAPS5't get caught, or by playing music that is offensive in stores with younger kids, let's them think that they can sell whatever they want, promote their music where ever they want, makes the companies win.  I'm not a mother, nor am I soon-to-be-a-mother, but I find @CAPS7 it highly offensive that companies and stores would do that. i wouldn't want my child looking at a magazine than asking me questions about the @CAPS2 people nearly naked, or have them ask me what a word means when @CAPS7's a cuss word. I certainly wouldn't buy a book that just looks strange or offensive to my child.  As well, I strongly do believe in '@CAPS13 Freedom of Speech', so the companies, in a way, do have a right to sell their product how @CAPS7 it is. Just, if they really wanted to selll their product that much, that bad, than they should sell @CAPS7 it online. @CAPS7 It @MONTH1 would cost more, but at least everyone would know that their childeren wouldn't see @CAPS7 it. Although, once you owned @CAPS7 it, than @CAPS7's the buyers fault if their child saw @CAPS7 it. That would be on the parents plate to deal with.  Another thing with childeren, is
442	3419	2	3	I myself think that all books should be off the shelves because I do find some books to be offensive in their contents. I also find it very annoying when people have books and you are trying to talk to them ALL they do is ignore you KEEP READING I find that disrespectful. Myself though I do not like reading I find it to be boring SOMETIMES TIREING unless it is actually a good book. I also could say that some movies should be taken off shelves because they are so stupid HAVE NO POINT such as Harry Potter, Twilight and most other books that have mythical creatures in them. Music on the other hand should BE taken off because it is alot easier to relate to and understand I MAY be wrong but that's my personal opinion of the whole ordeal. Some music in the lyrics can show who you are and what you stand for in life. Music shows character IS EASIER to follow than movies or a boring old book. I listen to music all the time you hardly ever see me with a book in my hands. I sometimes do watch movies but they are more action, comedy though I really DON't like scary movies though I do watch some I DON't like ones with weird looking creatures in it that's just not what I look for in a movie. I can list some books, movies AND music I like, for instant two books I like are Blood is Thicker and Until We Met Again by [Author's Name]. Movies I like are all five of the FAST AND FURIOUS movies, Transformers, The Equalizer and my all time favorite MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, DIE HARD and the new Karate Kid. Music I listen to consist of Drake, Eminem, Taylor Swift, Bruno Mars, Nashville, Lil Wayne, Billie Eilish, Post Malone, Def Leppard, Atlanta, Rolling Stones, Memphis, Metallica, ACDC and [Artist's Name], they are all great singer song writers and do a great job at what they do MAKE MILLIONS off of it I mean come on people love music more then anything. There are movie music albums sold in the world than there are book and movies combined which I really think proves a big point when I say music is better. Surveys have been taken music wins every time. So therefore this concludes my opinion on this subject and I hope I voiced it good enough to prove my point to people in the world that say books AND movies are better because they're not.
443	3420	2	3	"I think it's beneficial to have potentially inappropriate material available in stores or libraries because offensive content often attracts buyers. People who've experienced hardship might seek books reflecting their struggles, even if the content is offensive. My stance on censorship leans towards keeping offensive materials accessible because they are popular. Music, magazines, books, and movies can entertain adults and teenagers with their provocative content. Teens often adopt styles and behaviors from music, which can be a major source of this ""inappropriate vibe.""  Furthermore, offensive movies and television can be educational. Movies can offer life lessons or guidance, even within offensive contexts. Similarly, television shows, despite potentially inappropriate content, can teach viewers what to avoid. Books, a popular form of entertainment, often resonate with readers due to their relatable themes like personal reflections, struggles, love, humor, and drama. Readers may seek out offensive books to connect with shared experiences or gain insight into others' lives, or to be insightful of future career choices.  Magazines are the least offensive item on shelves, though I question their value due to their focus on gossip and misinformation, which ironically drives sales. While I believe magazines need improvement, offensive materials like music, movies, and books should remain accessible because they attract consumers, provoke thought, and offer potential learning experiences. In essence, the demand and potential benefits of these materials outweigh the concerns about their offensive nature."
444	3421	2	3	@PERSON1, an author, once said; 'All of use can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In other words, she argues against censorship, prooving the fact that books should not be censored in any form of way, in which I take the affirmative side on. To begin with, censorship is simply the banning of certain things that are thought to be offensive. An example of this would be the society in the book '@CAPS1 @NUM1' by @PERSON2. In this book, @PERSON3, the main character and eventually the protagonist, is a firefighter that cause fires instead of putting them out. The government believes that books are dangerous because they cause people to become knowledgable so as a result, they order people to burn them, making society ignorant and a potential 'slave' to their government. Despite loosing his job and almost being killed by the goverment, @PERSON3 rises to understand that books have true meaning and that what the government is doing is wrong. This topic now poses a question: Is all censorship bad? Of course not. Some censorship should be allowed as a matter of fact. For example, any form of media whether it is books or magazines that portreys hatred toward a certain religion or group should be censored by the government because according to our constitution, people have the right to believe and practice whatever they wish (also know as 'freedom of speech'). However, the majority of censorship does not take a good side. In the political world today, censorship is applied to people who speak out against their government or leader due to the fact that they had been dishonest or ruthless to the people. Even in our country today, the government applies this which in some cases violates the constitution because people have the freedom of speech, but to a certain extent only. Overall, the negative outcomes of censorship outweigh the positive outcomes. Censorship causes people to become uneducated which on the other hand makes it illegal for a person to speak out against something even if it is wrong. On the other had, censorship towards things that portey hatred is not bad either. In conclusion however, bad censorship causes people to become uneducated, at the end resulting in pure ignorance.
445	3422	2	3	I find it interesting that people think it's their problem to go to the bookshelf and say this and that shouldn't be allowed here. I also feel that if you don't like the book, don't look at it, or read it. I mean, I kind of understand about the magazines because sometimes they can be pretty bad. I mean, at the same time, it's no one's job to say what is right and what is wrong. The music, I am somewhat in agreement with it being taken out of the libraries. Some of the music people listen to today is just not right for kids or adults. People are wanting to know why there is so much killing and hate in the world today. The movies at the libraries are pretty good; they don't let them get too bad. I can't complain too much about that. All around, the libraries are doing a good job with how they handle it. Just some stuff that I would change, but really what I think doesn't matter. I'm only a thirteen-year-old kid; I mean, I can give my thoughts about it, but that's about it. I love the libraries; nothing will ever stop me from going. If I don't like something, then I just don't read it or look at it, and that's how everyone should be. So, overall, while I have some reservations, I believe libraries are doing a commendable job balancing access and appropriateness, and personal choice should be paramount.
446	3423	2	3	'Should libraries censor reading material's to students at school.'That is a yes an no quistion because reading is good for people of all age's its just is the topic suitable for certain age group. Yes, I do think they should censor reading material, But to an exstent they need to have books for kids at certain age groups. like have sections for young kids then teens and then adults. if the child wants t read more graphic material then they must have pramission from their parent. the reason i say that is there are things that get published by authord that are ment to be read by certain people. Therefore, having age-appropriate sections and parental consent for more mature content ensures both access to reading and protection from unsuitable material, balancing intellectual freedom with responsible guidance.
447	3424	2	3	Regardless of if we are speaking of the religious demanding books such as the *Harry Potter* series to be ripped from our shelves or conservatives wanting to burn the libraries, books can always bring about controversy. In this country we are given the rights to freedom of speech and press, so why can anyone demand that a book be banned? Everyone in our world has different thoughts, beliefs, morals and values so why should we try to force our own views on others? We should not. Imposing our views upon others can be done just as easily through putting a controversial book on the shelves as it can by taking it off. Music, movies and magazines are no different, all express the ideas and beliefs of their respective writer, and all deserve to be accessed by anyone who desires to do so. Books, there are lists of hundreds of banned books and honestly you could find a dozen reasons to ban any book ever written. If you ban one writer's words because they speak passionately or discretely on a controversial topic, then you must ban them all, and if you have to ban the words then you must also ban the writer so that he or she cannot voice his or her opinion. If we did this then our country and our world would be without opinion, voiceless, and without a voice their is no direction and no moving forward. If the people of our world are denied the right to write a book on their opinion then what kind of world do we live in? If you can ban my words, then I can ban yours and we have both lost our voice and our chance at somehow brightening the future. Imagine the impact if the Nazi's had locked away every copy of the *Diary of Anne Frank* because it brought about change and controversy. Imagine a world where we had never heard of Shakespeare or Dickens. It would be a would far different from our own. A world without powerful voices influencing not only our daily actions, but hundreds of years of war, love, and hate. It would be one without direction, where people are left to wonder but never to express or discuss. It would be a terrible place. While children should not exactly be watching porn or reading *Playboy*, they definantly should not be kept from reading, listening to, or watching anything they desire. Values and morals should be gained by reading, discovering and thinking, not forced upon us by our government or our parents. Rap music may have lyrics that some would consider rude but to another they may speak a message. To a creationist Darwin's views may seem stupid and offensive, but to an atheist they may be what makes sense. We should all have access to all opinions so that we can develop our own. We should not have the values and ideas of others beaten into our heads, we should be able to develop our own through an exploration through those of others. Censorship is wrong, our government has no business in what we choose to explore and no one should be restricted by the views of another, as limiting access to diverse perspectives hinders intellectual growth and societal progress.
448	3425	2	3	I believe everyone has their own choice when it comes to taking a book off a shelf. You should know what you're picking up. If you think it might be offensive to you, then set it back on the shelf. It's as easy as that. Taking offensive articles off shelves of libraries just because a couple of people are unhappy ruins everyone's opportunity on maybe finding what they were looking for. Censorship in libraries is just unneeded. Everyone should be able to take care of themselves. Read the title before you pick up the book. It could give you a good hint on whether or not it might offend you. Children on the other hand should be overlooked by an adult just to make sure they don't pick up anything that should not be viewed as a child. Taking offensive articles off the shelves ruins good books for everyone else. Not everyone is offended by the same material. For some it might be pictures. For others it could just be words. But this offensive material happens in everyday life throughout the world. It just can not be avoided. So why take it out of libraries. If it's really offensive in any way put a warning sticker on the book. It will warn people that the book might contain material that might offend the reader of the book. It will benefit both sides of this argument. People will be less offended because they won't unexpectingly pick up a book and be offended. But the people that might enjoy reading the offensive books still can read them. Everyone has their own choice when it comes to picking up a book. You should have an idea of what you're picking up. Just because you made a mistake and picked up an offensive article, why take it away from others that might enjoy reading them. Everyone is exposed to offensive material through everyday life. So why have censorship in libraries. It's not accomplishing anything, as we should trust individuals to make their own informed decisions about what they choose to read.
449	3426	2	3	I think that we should censor things our children read and look at in the libraries. They are young eyes and they are too young to be looking at that stuff. They would be taught the wrong thing at a very young age. They would grow up the wrong way. We need to take a stand on what our kids look at, ensuring they are shielded from inappropriate content. For the future we need censorship, carefully curating what influences their developing minds. This proactive approach is essential to guide their moral compass. Please everyone take a stand and protect our children's innocence by advocating for responsible library content.
450	3427	2	3	No, we should not have to take certain things off of library shelves. Think of it in your own perspective. For example, say you like horror books. If someone else doesn't like horror and you do, and they take it off of the shelves, how mad would you be. I like @CAPS1 magazines, like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @ORGANIZATION1. If there is a bad picture or anything in it, they took it off. My perspective is that if you don't like what you see, then put the book, magazine, or whatever it might be up. Don't just sit there and complain, because how would you feel if the same thing happened to you? I have had personal experience with these kinds of problems. At my school, we used to have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1, just non-hurtful things. All it took, though, was one person to complain about it, and boom! They were gone. @CAPS1 fanatics like me don't like to see our favorite things gone. So really, what is the problem? The problem is that people can't handle what they see. It is understandable to a certain point. Like if you're a very religious person, then yes, I understand that you couldn't look at those things. But when you do it just to spite someone, then that is very hurtful. I just want to say that if you have a problem, keep it to yourself. Just because you don't like something, doesn't mean someone else won't. You wouldn't want it to happen to you, so extending that courtesy to others is a good idea.
451	3428	2	3	First comes censorship along with its totalitarian prowess, second comes the downfall of humanity. We have all seen the horrors of totalitarianism over time. From the STALIN regime of RUSSIA to the banning of BOOKS in the OTTOMAN empire. It always is a terror that falls violently. Farenheit 451 was written by BRADBURY in the mid twentieth century, forshadowing a wicked future if censorship is brought to humanity. The human populaion will no longer have actual knowledge, only what they have been told. In this book, the population is forbidden from having any kind of book. Their history is completely makeshifted by the government into a psychological madness. As if propaganda doesn't warp the minds of people enough, censorship of books would be the end. Man must know his foundation and where he comes from. All it takes is one little book to be taken of the shelf. Eventually they all will start coming down til there are none. The government will erase history as it is and create one that warps the minds of all to believe the goverment is righteous. When the malignant being is the government itself. This all brings up one of the worlds greatest questions. What actually should be kept out of viewing for all to see? We all think it is correct to keep pornographic material and adult language away from children. What is it that actually made these things intolerable in the first place? We have been taught our whole lifes that these things are, but when real censorship comes in, so does the apocalypse of all knowledge. People believe anything they are told as long as enough people are saying it. I, without slight hesitation, stand against censorship in every way. People have the right to know everything. Parents still have the ability to keep things they see as unacceptable from their children as much as they please to do so. Let man choose what is intolerable to him. Censorship goes against everything the western democracies stand for. All freedoms are taken away by that one word. The democracies feared communism due to its totalitarian government. The communists censored everything inside the SOVIET UNION. History has shown us time and time again that totalitarianism is unsuccessful. The people must be free and must be able to live their own lifes. Only then will they defend their countries so they can preserve freedom. Both world wars resulted in totalitarian regimes beeing taken down by the free, uncensored men of the democracies. A word is simply a word. People will always have their own views on everything. Arguments about every little thing will always be at hand. We all must understand that although we all have differences in our beliefs, we must prevent censorship and accept all. The day we dont, censorship will come, and noone will have the right to believe in what they want, therefore it is humanity's decision and it must be made at this time when the world is at its greatest.
452	3429	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that if a book is on a shelf the book should be taken off if found offensive. People at libraries fight over a book. They need to have more than one copy of a book if they fight over one book. If the library dosen't have more than one copy of a book it will create a lot of prolums for everyone.  People in library fight over a sigle book. I think who ever gets there first should get the book, but that just me. If two people fight over a book they should be kicked out of the library and never come back to the library. And that is why we have fights over a book. The next time you are in a library think frist before you act. Ask yourself '@CAPS3 did they get there before me?'.  The library should have more that one copy of a book. Lets say '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1' book sreies is in the library and thay have one of each book. Now the lat move of '@ORGANIZATION1' is coming out this @DATE2 (@DATE1) and people what the last book to read. The kids what it, but there is one book. So what do you do? Get more copies of the book. This is why libraries should have more than one copy.  If the libraries don't have more than one copy of a book it will create a lot of prolums. If they have one copy of a book it will begin fights. You don't what to fight in a library (look @CAPS4 @NUM1). Now if it was me, I will let someone have it that whan it. So, libraries need more than one copy.  In conclusion I think that if a book is on a shelf, the book should be taken off if found offensive. There fighting for a book and you don't whant that. The libraries needs more than one copy of a book, so they will not fight over it. If the libraries don't have copies of a book it will create prolums. So, think before yo act because it can be found offensive at time.  Sincesly, @PERSON1
453	3430	2	3	The perception of what constitutes an offensive book is subjective. Determining whether content warrants removal from public access is complex, as sensitivities vary widely. While some material, particularly graphic or explicit content, might be deemed offensive by many, others may not share that view. Designating a separate section for potentially offensive items could be a compromise. Ultimately, complete removal is debatable, as items arguably have a right to exist on shelves. Parental guidance is crucial; policing content becomes a personal responsibility. It's for parents to set boundaries and decide what their children consume, instead of expecting institutions to universally censor material. If parents don't want their children exposed to certain content, the onus is on them to manage that exposure. Therefore, it's difficult for an outsider to dictate what is offensive and should be restricted, as individual values and parental control play a significant role in shaping exposure and perspectives.
454	3431	2	3	Every book holds a potential meaning or message valuable to someone. Removing a book from a library diminishes access to knowledge for those who might need it. Disagreement with a book's views does not justify its removal. Books, regardless of potentially offensive content, should remain accessible. Both positive and negative perspectives should be available for interested readers. Music and movies, while potentially suitable, require careful consideration. Their inclusion in a library, traditionally a place of peace, should be contingent on maintaining a tranquil environment. While positive music and movies can offer comfort alongside reading, disruption warrants exclusion. Magazines present another challenge, often blending educational content with entertainment. Because many prioritize entertainment over education, their presence in a library is questionable. A library should prioritize learning, not entertainment. Removing books restricts potential knowledge, so books should remain accessible regardless of content. Music, movies, and magazines should have limited presence in libraries to ensure a learning environment.
455	3432	2	3	'@CAPS1 Should be Taken off the @CAPS2' @CAPS1 should be taken off the shelves? Nothing. At least thats @CAPS1 I think. For any book you can find some bad thing about it. People can not keep bad things away from kids it doesnt work @CAPS4 that. Whether it is cursing, sex, gore, racism, teens will find them and I think it would be better if they were found in a book instead of real life.  Most young adult books have cursing. There is no way around it. Teens hear cursing every day. At home, school, or even at work and yes it is offensive and no there is nothing you can do to stop it. It is there and part of our life.  Most adults think that if they don't shelter teens then they will find all this bad stuff in music. @CAPS1 adults don't understand is that teens do @CAPS1 ever they want to be happy. The music of today's is very offensive, but the @CAPS4 it!!!!! That is @CAPS1 is 'hot' in the music world right now.  Ok say a kid was from a run down home and all he had was a radio, and that radio only got one station and the station was pop music, which most parents don't @CAPS4. That pop music would make the kid happy. Would you really take that away from him just because it is offensive???  Sex a lot of really good books have sex in there, but if a kid is at home reading about sex the he or she is not out doing it. Plus sex makes books better. I read books that contain rape, and other sexual acts but I've never done it only read about it.  Race is another big deal. 'To @CAPS5 a @CAPS6' is an amazing book and every kid should read it so they can learn. That is the whole point in reading is so you can learn. We need to learn about those kind of thing.  Keeping us sheltered is not going to protect us it only makes us want @CAPS1 ever we can't have even more. Music, books, magazines, and other stuff help us learn dont take that away from us. If we don't @CAPS4 it we will not read it or listen to it. Don't chose for us let us learn on our own. It is our life. Let us make our own mistakes, because ultimately, these experiences, whether through books or other media, are crucial for growth and understanding.
456	3433	2	3	Libraries, not many people like them, but most people do. Libraries are almost in every town. People like to go there to read books, get on the computers, and do activities with their families. But there are some things that people would really want to do there but they cannot because of their age or so, or it just might be prohibited at all times. Do you think the advantages and disadvantages at the library are fair enough for everyone? Most people really do not think that you must always go to the library for things because if you are an irresponsible person with all the damage that you have done to the item that you have checked out or how late you turn it in, it could cost the same amount of money as buying that item. If you are a responsible person then you are fine. But some do not think that the libraries should be putting stuff there if they are not going to let anyone touch it or check it out. So if they are not going to let one person get an item from the library then it should be removed from there, because there will be at least one person who will want to get that item and it would be rude if the librarian tells you no you cannot have that. Libraries should just stick to the same old same old: a section for kids with kid books, a section for the middle schoolers and the teenagers, and a section for the high schoolers and the adults, and mostly everything will work out fine. Just want to make it fair for everyone since it is the public library of your town. Now that some facts and opinions have been stated, hopefully the libraries and librarians do think about what they are going to put and what they are not going to put on the shelves of a public library to make it fair for everyone. So do you think the advantages and disadvantages at the library are fair enough for everyone? This ultimately depends on how well libraries balance accessibility with restrictions, ensuring that resources are available while also setting reasonable boundaries for all members of the community.
457	3434	2	3	"Dear @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1, I'm writing your newspaper company this letter because I feel the same way Katherine Paterson feels, and we should not be able to have any of the following books @NUM2, and any sexual books. Because they can scar a kid's mind forever, so in my opinion any books with that stuff in the book should not be on the shelf for any public library. Also, we should have more censorship in books with inappropriate speaking because it can give a person a change in thought. Also, let me give you an example: let's say a little boy asks where the action books are. The librarian would say, ""Well, aren't you a little too young to be reading these books?"" and the child would say, ""No, but I heard this was a really good book, and my big brother said it's a good book too."" And in my opinion, that is all I need to say. Therefore, I strongly believe that carefully selecting appropriate reading material is crucial to protect young minds from potentially harmful content. Sincerely, your customer @PERSON2."
458	3435	2	3	This statement is not right. People should be allowed to read whatever they want or listen to or watch whatever movie they want. When someone reads something that's bad they might or might not like it. So people should not take away books, movies, and music that are bad. One thing that people should have is a choice of what they read and other stuff. Books some people like reading bad stuff because they enjoy it. If the person do not like it they should put it back and find something else to read. Now movies are a lot of fun to watch. But when you watch a new movie you should rent it first to see if you like the offensive scenes or not. And the age thing, you should watch a movie with an adult if you're too young. Now music is one thing that is offensive should not be taken off the shelves. Because if you don't like it do not pick it up from the shelves and tell people that's bad music when it could be some great music. Ok there is one thing that can be taken off the shelves is the magazines. It's bad for people to be reading those type of magazines. If they want them they should order them online mail at their house. So people should not take off the shelves are books, movies, and music but they can take away magazines. People like the books and stuff that have bad stuff in them. And there should be no taking off the shelves, because people should have the freedom to choose what they consume. That's what I think if someone took something off the shelves.
459	3436	2	3	I think that books, music, movies, and magazines should not have to be removed from shelves of libraries. People find entertainment in movies with sexual or violent activity in them. I believe that if we do take all of the stuff that involves offensive things off shelves then some people will be upset. In our generation today, people look forward to see things that they can't see at home with their parents. Music these days has a lot of bad language in them, but that's what makes people interested in them. The same with movies. Books, music, and movies today talk a lot about sexual intercourse, illegal drugs, and criminal involvement. This kind of stuff gets our attention, and makes us interested.  If you have a child or someone in the family that you don't want them to watch, listen, or read about offensive stuff then don't let them see it. Most stores with offensive stuff have a back room where they keep all of it, so they don't have to worry about others seeing it. However, libraries are public spaces, and people do take offense sometimes, but that doesn't mean that libraries should have to take them off their shelves.  People can make their own decision of what they want to listen, watch, or read. Everybody can choose what they prefer. Everybody has their own opinion on things. I think that libraries will have more business with the offensive things then without. Younger people find more interest in the things that seem like a dream, or things that seem so unreal. Therefore, I think that they should keep offensive music, books, movies, and magazines out on shelves, because we have our own freedom to do what we want, and we should respect that freedom. Lots of people find many pleasures in watching offensive things. If you don't want to see or listen to stuff you don't prefer then don't look for them at the libraries, as the choice of what to consume should ultimately rest with the individual.
460	3437	2	3	If you get offended because of a book, magazine, music, or movies then don't read, watch, or listen to it. America shouldn't be censored. Censorship should be for young children. If you're grown and get offended by something having the '@CAPS1-word' on it then don't read it. If a movie drops the '@CAPS1-bomb' then don't watch it. I completely disagree with someone wanting to remove vulgar words.  I don't get offended by swearing because it's usually used in a funny way, like telling jokes, or it makes a crappy song good, adding a layer of expression. Censorship is helpful for children, but vulgar things shouldn't be removed from society, and it never will.  More often than not, kids learn cuss words from parents or friends. If you don't want your kid to cuss or be surrounded by cussing then remove them from that situation. It's the parents responsibility to protect or 'censor' a child's environment, steering them clear of potentially harmful influences. Ultimately, personal choice and parental guidance are more effective than widespread censorship for adults.
461	3438	2	3	The books in the libraries that I have read so far dont seem like they would be offensive to anyone and I havn't really listen to the music in the libraries or watch the movies and the magazines seem fine to. That doesnt mean that there isn't any of those that can be offensive to other people but if there is then I think that they should take them out of the libraries but I think if someone found something like that they would probably just put it back and not go there again. If they took out every book, music, movies, and magazines that people thought were offensive then I bet alot of them would be out and that wouldnt be fair to other people because maybe they want or listen or read or watch them and they would be really mad if they found out they was taken out because other peoplr thought they were offensive. Some people would probably understand that some of those could hurt someones feelings or be offensive to other people but then theres other ones that dont care. I think that some of them should be taken out if they are really bad and I wouldn't want other little kids reading them and gettin their feelings hurt or anything but if there not that bad then I don't they should be gone and I don't think people would really care if those stayed in them. If thiers ones that are really bad and if they stayed in the libraries then probably no one would want to come back to the libraries and sooner or later less and less people would stop going. So the best thing to probably do is just take them out and keep the people that keep going in the libraries because alot of people enjoy reading and thats what they do for fun and they would be really upset if they couldnt go no more over something that stupid. This is especially important because libraries are supposed to be welcoming places for everyone in the community, and it's a shame when offensive content drives people away from using valuable resources.
462	3439	2	3	I believe that most books, magazines, or any reading material containing offensive content should be accessible. Many individuals need exposure to these materials to understand their content and perspectives. People often react negatively to minor elements like curse words or discussions of drug use. It's difficult to find a book entirely devoid of curse words, and often people focus on these small details when the material could contain significantly more problematic elements. I have encountered books with inappropriate language, and once, a book with a promising title turned out to be filled with profanity. It seems that this is a common occurrence now. People need to accept that offensive content is prevalent in various forms of reading material. I strongly disagree with removing books, music, movies, or magazines from shelves because what may be unappealing to one person could be interesting to another. Since people hold diverse opinions, the decision to engage with specific reading material should be left to the individual, and ultimately people should be allowed to choose what they want to read, listen to, or view.
463	3440	2	3	Should taking books, music, and movies off shelves of libraries even be questioned? As stated in our constitution, people have the freedom to information. People have had this luxury ever since the beginning of this marvelous country. Also we have the choice to either pick up a type of book or not too. So to answer my question, taking types of books and movies off shelves is completely out of the question.  In the United States, it is understood that people have the freedom of speech, religion, and many others including freedom to information. Due to this reason places like libraries should have as much information as possible out on there shelves. Even if some of the conduct is inapropriate, it still serves a way to educate. Which for children, education is largely what their childhood is for. Parents and teachers are always pushing their kids to go out, read and learn new topics other than what is being taught in the classroom or at home. If books were to be taken of the shelves, we would only be depriving our youth of knowledge in the world. All books or magazines may be benificial to some and offensive to others. However for those who would find this beneficial do we want to simply go against our constitution and deprive them of that information?  Another topic in the United States is the freedom of choice. Even if bad books or magazines are on the shelve, children have the choice to pick them up. Parents should simply tell there kids to leave those types of materials alone and choose something else. Having books that may seem innapropriate to some, aren't hurting anyone by just sitting on the shelve. However some, may come aross a book like this and find it very interesting and decide to check it out. This action plays no effect on child who is not supossed to be viewing material like that. Finally, it is very simple to avoid this type of information, all one has to do is simply not choose to look at it and walk right by it.  As for myself, I personally as a child was not allowed to view certain types of movies, books, or magazines. For example I was restricted from watching rated R movies or things with innapropriate sexual actions. Since this was the case, I simply avoided those types of movies or magazines that had those types of content. For most of my childhood I did this and it was very simple. However, I don't think it would be fair to remove those types of things from other children. For the reason that it's their choice to do what ever they would like and that it has no affect on me at all. Lastly, I feel like removing certain things from libraries would be very unfair to children who have the privelage to view them.  In conclusion, removing materials, such as books, music, and movies is completely absurd. As I said before doing something like this, would be going against our constitutuion. The answer to solving this problem to me is black and white, children should just not pick up those types of materials end of case.
464	3441	2	3	The library has many books; they would have anything that you could possibly imagine. The library is a great resource for any information. They have so much information that if you were to go to the library, you would be there all day. Libraries carry many different kinds of books. They would probably even carry a book perhaps on hats. There are libraries all around us and are very convenient. If a library carried misleading books, music, movies, or even magazines, I would have to say that they could get in a lot of trouble, especially if a magazine or a movie or any other source of information, would show anything that would offend someone in any way, then someone should tell the librarian or the manager and say this should not be on the shelf. When people go to the library they are expecting clean reviews about the library. If a library were meant to carry offensive products it would not be called the library. The library is meant to be a quiet place where someone could go there and browse around maybe, or just go in and get what they need and come right on out . Most libraries are pretty particular of what they should or should not put out on their shelves. If someone put something way out of the ordinary, and that person knows that they should not put the book on the shelf they should automatically be fired. The staff has to be cautious of what they put out. In conclusion libraries are very nifty and important to the town or city. The only thing would be is to keep an eye out for any offensive books, music, and etc. You never know when they will be randomly out on the shelf, and if you happen to find one you should immediately tell the librarian or the library's manager, because the library could get in trouble and then again they may not.
465	3442	2	3	DO I BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN MATERIALS, SUCH AS BOOKS, MUSIC, MOVIES, MAGAZINES, ETC., SHOULD BE REMOVE FROM THE SHELVES IF THEY ARE FOUND OFFESIVE? I WOULD HAVE TO SAY NO. THE REASONE WHY I STATE THIS BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE BOOKS THAT HELP YOU THROUGH OUT YOUR LIFE. THERE ARE RUDE AND HORABLE THINGS OUT IN THE WORLD. LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS EASY AND SOME OF THOSE BOOKS WOULD HELP YOU WITH YOUR DESION MAKING. NOW THESE ARE THE REASONS WHY I THINK SO. FIRST, HOW WOULD THE BOOK HELP OTHERS IN THE LONG RUN. I THINK IT WOULD BECAUSE SOME BOOKS TALK ABOUT THRE REAL DEAL. LIKE HOW TEENAGE GIRL BEING A MOTHER AT A YOUNG AGE, OR HOW KIDS DONT FINISH SCHOOL AND NOW THEY ON THE STREET, IN JAIL, OR WORST. BOOKS MATERIALS LIKE THESE MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN SOMEONE LIFE OTHER THAN YOU. BOOKS CAN HELP PEOPLE NAVIGATE DIFFICULT SITUATIONS OR MAKE INFORMED CHOICES. SO THATS ONE REASON. SECONDLY, THESE BOOKS IS LIKE A GUIDE TO OTHERS. THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE, IF PEOPLE READ ABOUT VOILENCE AND STUFF THEY WOULD SEE WHAT THEY DONT WANT TO GO THREW LIKE MYSELF FOR EXAMPLE. I WAS READING THIS BOOK CALL MY HOOD. AND THIS BOOK TALK ABOUT ALOT OF STUFF THAT I HAVE SEEN WITH MY OWN EYES LIKE GANG BANGING, SEX, DRUGS, HOOD FIGHTS ETC., THAT HAPPENS IN THE REAL WORLD. READING ABOUT NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES CAN ACT AS A WARNING, HELPING INDIVIDUALS AVOID SIMILAR PATHS. THIRDLY, MANY PEOPLE THAT I KNOW OF DONT REALLY LIKE TO GET ADVISE OR TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR PROMBLEMS. AND THEY CAN GET A BOOK OR SOMTHING THAT HAVE THE SAME FEATURES AS WHAT THEY MIGHT BE GOING THREW. THOSE BOOKS AND THINGS IS NOT VERY BAD THEY ACTUALLY HELP. AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE THEY REALLY NOT BAD THERE LIKE A LITTLE GUIDE TO MANY PEOPLE. BOOKS CAN PROVIDE COMFORT AND INSIGHT FOR THOSE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO SEEK HELP ELSEWHERE. SO IN CONCLUSION DO I BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN MATERIALS, SUCH AS BOOKS, MUSIC, MAGAZINE, ETC., SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE SHELVES IF THEY ARE FOUND OFFENSIVE. ABOSULTLY NOT BECAUSE THOSE BOOK TALKS ABOUT REAL LIFE AND LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS FAIR. By offering a glimpse into the harsh realities of life, these materials serve as valuable resources for personal growth and decision-making.
466	3443	2	3	Censorship or not? That is the question. Many people @MONTH1 don't realize it, but what they read and watch greatly affects them. If children watch a scary movie, then nightmares seem to occur more often. If teens read a book where parties seem cool and bad things are glorified, they too start to see bad as good. What if @CAPS2 article you are reading right now contained offensive language and inappropriate ideas? Most people would be offended and complain. If you saw an old man walking down the street yelling out obtrusive things, you would be mad and tell him to quit. So then the question is arisen, why is it alright for us to watch movies like @CAPS2? Yes, books and movies should be censored. Children are very naive at a young age. When a child starts getting exposed to violence, illegal acts, alcohol and drugs in books or movies, they start to think it's okay. For instance, when I was younger, I watched the movie '@CAPS1.' @CAPS2 movie contains a profanity every other word, so it seems. I saw my favorite actors on @CAPS2 movie saying bad words, so I figured it was alright. It's not okay for a child to talk offensively like that. One day I even heard a little @LOCATION2 quoting lines from the '@CAPS3.' @CAPS2 movie is hilarious but extremely suggestive. It made me sad to hear an innocent little @LOCATION2 talking about things that are way over his head. Teenagers that listen to music from @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2 are getting bad messages. Although these two rappers are seen as modern day music heroes, they shouldn't be glorified the way they are. They're songs are all about smoking weed and getting high. They make it seem cool. So teenagers think, '@CAPS5 if they can do it, so can I!' They start to engage in activities that were once frowned upon. If teenagers weren't exposed to @CAPS2 kind of music, they wouldn't be as apt to take part in such things. As for adults, their movies and books should be censored too. One @MONTH1 think that once they're older they can do what they want, but that's not the case. Let me throw out an example to you. Let's just say a husband and wife are watching a movie together. It's great until a rather, inappropriate, shall we say, scene comes on. Not only does it make things awkward, but it sends out the wrong message. When adults or unmarried people see their favorite actors being naughty on television, it makes it seem right. They start to lose the concept that you are supposed to remain abstinent until marriage. After all, it is the only way to remain free of any diseases. If movies, books, magazines, and music continue to be left uncensored, the world will become a giant brouhaha. People will begin to lose the sense of what is right and what is wrong. We are on the brink of violence and total chaos. If we continue to let our children and ourselves watch these types of movies and whatnot, things will get ugly. Yes, if libraries or stores find anything offensive on their racks, then they need to censor it before it corrupts any more minds.
467	3444	2	3	I do not believe that movies, books, music, etc. should be removed from shelves. I believe that people are entitled to their own opinion about what they choose to listen to, read or watch, everybody has their own level of maturity. Parents who are concerned about their child watching/reading something, always have the right to tell them no, and to keep whatever it is out of their grasp. People are entitled to their own opinion on what is appropriate level material for themselves. Whether it is books, movies or music, a person always has the choice of whether or not they want to be in contact with that item, making the decision personal. It is a good idea to keep more explicit things only for adults, but if it is supposed to be for a certain age level, it should be out for the choice to be up to that certain person. Different people have different levels of maturity, so it is hard for one person or company to say what age level should or should not be using that material. A lot of parents will disagree with this issue, because they think that children should be kept away from the violence and vulgar images or language that are in the media these days. But at the same time, they fight for the right to raise their child the way they want to. People have the right to take away material that is too mature for their child, but no one should be able to say that someone else's child should not be able to view that material, because just because one person finds it offensive, does not mean that other people will. If someone should find something offensive they should have the common sense to not view that material any more, it's that simple. Everyone has that right so I do not think that companies have the right to take that away from them. Parents can censor what their children watch, and adults have the ability to make their own decisions about this topic and what they consume. This proves that certain items, like books, movies, and music, should not be taken off the shelf, as the choice ultimately belongs to the individual and their family.
468	3445	2	3	"I personally don't believe they should use censorship in libraries. I feel as though no one has the right to say people are or aren't allowed to enjoy certain material just because someone thinks that it is offensive because that's just one person's opinion. What's one man's trash is another man's gold; what one person finds offensive could be sought out by millions. Plus, in today's world, if everything was censored, there would be nothing left, not even church, because everyone has their own opinion and their own belief, which would eventually eliminate everything because there will always be at least one person who thinks something is offensive in some way, shape, or form. If everything was censored, people wouldn't even be able to express themselves. If censorship was used everywhere, schools wouldn't be able to teach half of the material they teach today, and kids would have nothing to be involved in. Author Katherine Paterson once said, ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf—that work I abhor—then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" I, for one, completely agree with this quote. It's true, as I have already stated, if everything was censored, there'd be nothing left to be enjoyed. Think about it this way: would you like someone telling you that you're not allowed to read or listen to certain material just because someone felt as though it was offensive and thought it should be taken away from the public? I'm pretty sure that would make most people upset, especially if they're an adult. I feel as though everyone has the right to choose what they read and listen to; such freedoms are essential to intellectual growth. So, if you ever get asked if censorship in libraries should be allowed, then think back to everything I've said before you give your answer. Once they start censoring what everyone can read and listen to, then they'll feel as though they can censor any and everything and control people's lives, ultimately diminishing individual autonomy."
469	3446	2	3	The quote that Katherine Paterson declares is a very strong point and is completely true in my eyes. Everyone thinks and functions differently so therefore something offensive to one person might be completely fair and good in another's point of view. Everybody thinks different and as you go to school or work everyday you find that obvious by just about anything the person is doing or owns. For instance, their clothing. Belongings can show a lot about a person just as much as actions or words. So what do you think? Do you think that any material from the library should be taken off the shelf just because someone or a couple of people think it's offensive or terrible? In my opinion, no. Every book, magazine or anything in the media can send out a different message in everyone's personal thoughts. For example, one movie could touch someone in a very special way and at the same time, someone right next to them could think it's disgusting and cruel. I have actually had a real life situation were this has been a conflict. During the years of my seventh grade experience there was this Playstation game that I loved to play and enjoyed playing every single day with all of my friends. My mother, and pretty much the entire town of Maycomb found it very offensive. It was really awkward and annoying that one of the things I loved is something that they tried to ban and not allow it to be sold from local stores. Now being in my shoes how do you think that felt for me? I thought it didn't feel very fair at all, it's selfish and inconsiderate. That's like taking somebody's possessions and telling them your opinion on them and then ditching them into the trash to rot and vanish forever. I believe that you should be able to read anything you would like in the library without the fear of your next favorite book being taken off of the shelf because a group of people protest from the language or whatever they think is offensive to them in the novel, because the next time you know it, everything will be gone from the shelves since everyone has different opinions. If you don't like the novel, then I assist you to return it, and to never read it again. I feel this conclusion is very fair and considerable, as everyone should have the freedom to choose what they consume. So what do you think as readers, is it fair to be able to read whatever you want or do you think if you or someone finds it offensive, you can take it off of the shelves?
470	3447	2	3	Throughout the world, there are thousands of people with various opinions. If one person thinks an art piece looks unique, another may not see any true beauty. But when people hardly understand the concept of other people, they should not be exposed to books or movies that could be defined as offensive. Some people don't know what it is like to be truly offended. When I was in middle school, I was a shy, fragile, young girl. I had just moved to a new school and was petrified of my new surroundings. For the first couple of weeks, I felt like an outcast; like an outsider looking in. I didn't fit in with anyones' group. Everyone seemed to of already have friends for years and here I was, a new student with no friends to communicate with. I was isolated and was desperately trying to find someone to be my friend. I wondered if something was wrong with me; if I has a bad odor or was dressed in an out of style fashion. I tried buying new clothes and changing my hair color. It seemed as if I wasn't even noticed. Before I knew it, school was half way over. I was still a nobody. Then David came along and made me a somebody. David, who had just moved to my school, looked bold and confident. At first, people waved a friendly hello but nothing more. As I sat at my empty lunch table, David approached me and asked to sit down. I couldn't refuse the offer so I nodded a sincere yes. The entire lunch period, we sat talking. We had a lot in common and I was glad to have made a friendship with David. Months went by before I realized David and I were great friends. I knew I could trust him with all of my secrets. Even though David and I were close, I felt as though he was always hiding something. Occasionally I would have enough courage to ask if there was anything he needed to tell me, but as the same as every answer before, it was a no. David and I had always walked to my house after school. But on one afternoon, something felt wrong. The air seemed to linger for miles. We didn't talk until we got inside my house. Suddenly David spoke and said, 'Why are people so cruel?' I was shocked by this question for I didn't know how to respond. David sensed that I had no clue what he was talking about so he continued. 'I'm gay.' I was appalled. Not because he was gay, but because he had never told me. I asked, 'What happened?' He sat on the couch then and told me about how he was in the library overhearing some of our classmates reading a book about people making fun of gays'. I felt awful for David. It wasn't his fault he was gay. I believe that certain books, movies, or music that are offensive to people should not be allowed on shelves. Some have never been offended. Some always offend people for many reasons. Everyone has feelings and it hurts when they are offended. We, as a community, should love one another and respect them, not read or listen to things that can hurt someones' inner feelings, thus creating a more supportive and understanding society.
471	3448	2	3	Dear Newspaper, I do indeed believe that certain books, magazines or any other form of reading material should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive. I say this because, in every situation, either one side benefits, both sides benefit, or neither side benefits. If you do not want that article or piece of writing to be seen by certain audiences, then do not put it on a public display.  It is best that they are in a solitaire area for audiences mature enough to handle the influence and/ or consequences that go along with that type of material. I say influence, because studies and personal views have shown that teens and even young children are often influenced by explicit views portrayed by media. These children act in ways that reflect what they have seen. If they watch a movie full of violence, they often feel it is their job to act in violent manners. Until they reach an age of maturity and responsibility to make their own decisions, they let the outside world decide what is best.  As a child grows up, they are obligated to follow certain rules or take authoritative matters seriously. Authority teaches us, as children. We develop through our teachings and grow through our surroundings. You may ask what it is I am speaking about. Well, I believe that this situation relates to the phrase 'think before you speak' because it seems that the people displaying this media don't think about the after effects of their actions.  Suggest that certain material may not only be impacting children and teens, but adults are highly affected as well. I am not speaking as though everyone who watches a movie or reads a book about a murderer will go out killing people. I am only saying that our surroundings almost make us who we are along with the way we were raised. The media gives us insight and ideas, in which sometimes revolve around our every thought.  I do believe that certain media, should be displayed in confidential locations. If not, then it should be a recommendation and obligation to have an age limit. My concern for public media display pertains to the concern of the impact on human lives. Thank you for your time, as I firmly believe that responsible media consumption is crucial for a healthy society.  Sincerely, A Concerned Citizen of [City, State]
472	3449	2	3	Many people find certain books, music, or magazines offensive or inappropriate for some young reads. Many people think that this material should be removed from libraries completely. People think that have young people exposed to this offensive material will effect the choices they make, and how they will react in certain situations. At the same time other people say that we should not remove it from the book shelves. They say that everyone has the right to read or listen to whatever he or she wants to. Its that persons right to choose weather or not it is age appropriate for them or not. Its not some elses right to take away choices that aren't theirs.  People who belive that they should remove this material from libraries think it will corrupt young minds. They believe that this material will convey a message that it is alright to do what these books and music are saying. This in turn will create a different mind set for the young reader. Which @MONTH1 cause the young reader to be more aggresive or more like to make bad decisions about there well being or the well being of those around them. These people want there libraries to be about learning and be a healthy eviornment were young minds can grow naturaly and unharmed by offensive material.  People who believe that they should leave this material on the shelf say its no one elses right to make this decison for you by removing them. Its the readers right to choose weather or not to read the material. The read will most likely learn what the material is saying regaurdless of weather it is in the library or not. They believe that it would be better for a young reader to learn about it in a safe enviornment then to have some one else later in there life show them or tell them. The enviornment maybe alot more dangerous then a library if learn though some one else.  I believe in both in a way. I believe it is not some one elses right to remove these books from libraries. But i also believe that it should not be avalible for young readers to get. These books maybe be offensive to some people but its there choice to read it. They do not have to read these books it does not affect them. I believe the books not suitable for young readers should be placed on either a higher shelf or in a different part of the library where young readers do not have acsess to. If a readers parents want them to learn about it in a safe enviornment then they should sit there children down and explain it to them themselves. In the end we all have our rights and we use those to choice weather to read or listen to certain material. It is no one elses choice besides your own, and it is important to remember this when considering censorship and access to information.
473	3450	2	3	While there are many books written out there, some have offended many types of people. Some just need to be wiped off the face of the earth; those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. That is one of my favorite quotes, and I don't use it lightly. Take, for example, 'The Anarchist Cookbook,' a book that gives instructions to build bombs and teaches you how to use firearms. This book is all about hate amongst people we don't fully understand, like their religion and how they look. This book frankly makes me sick to the stomach. That's why I think this book needs to be taken off the shelves for good. There was also hate propaganda in the books about how the Jews shouldn't be alive, and that's disgusting. I would be able to sleep better at night knowing this book was gone. One other book that should be taken off the shelves is a book written by none other than Adolf Hitler, the man that put so many people into gas chambers and many others to their undeserved graves. He sent men, women, and children to his many death camps and work camps. One of those many children was Anne Frank, who was in hiding from the Gestapo or 'Secret State Police'. Because of this monster, the Jewish community lost one of the world's greatest and most deepest writers for the 1940's. This book was filled with hate messages and how the Jewish people shouldn't be allowed to live amongst the 'supposed' Aryan race German people. But if we did not have this book, we would be sure to expect another Hitler on our hands. All in all, censorship in the libraries should be a rule, but only to the books worth keeping, not these horrific books.
474	3451	2	3	The library is a public area where anyone can visit to find a book, movie, or magazine of their desire. Not everyone is interested in the same book genre. The library is meant to have almost any book someone could think of. If someone discovers a book or movie that offends them, they should not make a big deal about it. They should not be removed from the shelves of the library. I am against the removal of offensive entertainment because it is not fair to everyone else that is a member of the library. What if a group of adults enjoyed a movie that someone else thought was disturbing? If the library took that movie off of the shelves, they would lose business due to one person. If a mother of a six year old boy wanted to report an inappropriate movie to the librarian, it would not be fair to anyone that is mature enough for that movie. It just is not fair to everyone else. The library is public property. With that being said, it is the library's job to please the public's desires for entertainment. They are obligated to supply books, movies, etc. for whomever. If one person does not like a particular book or magazine, they should search somewhere else for what they want. A few years back, my mom stopped taking my brother and I to the library because there were too many complaints about inappropriate books being supplied or taken off of the shelves. That year, the library lost @PERCENT1 of their customers because every time the library tried pleasing them, someone else was not pleased. If every article of entertainment were to remain on the shelf in the library, everyone would be happy, fostering a more inclusive and diverse environment. If someone does not approve of a movie or something, they can simply search another shelf, finding content that suits their tastes. Those who complain are only making more work for themselves and potentially limiting access for others, so maintaining a broad selection benefits the community as a whole.
475	3452	2	3	Do you think that certain books should not be shared with certain people? In all honesty yes, let them read and listen to whatever they think is interesting. No matter what the content that the book or song contains it's their choice, there is a power called freedom in this world. One might think that if you are able to read and comprehend the words that are wrote in that book or sang in a song, then yes read and listen to anything you want. If a young person such as a kindergartener picks up a book about sex you know there is no way that child will be able to comprehend it. So yes any books should be left on the shelf at libraries, open to anyone and everyone who are willing to read them. Its not that you have to be mature enough to read a book its that you have to understand it and are able to read to get what the book is trying to say. Yes some things parents don't want their children to know, but this world is filled with awful things and they are bound to figure some of those horrible things out sooner or later. Reading and music lets you learn and experience different situations that you might have never been in before. Both books and songs are a way to express yourself and everyone should express theirself in some way. When it comes to movies that's a different story. Those movies are rated for a reason. On a rated R film i could see 16 year olds on up watching it, because by then those kids have been in high school and everything sexual and perverted have been put into their little heads. Also most have been in sex education class. Blood and all things cruel have been talked about and heard about too. So yes let 16 year olds on up watch rated R films. The one thing that isn't suggested is taking a little kid to see a film that isn't rated for them. Say a parent took a 5 year old to see a scarry movie, more than likely that child is going to be scared and scarred from see blood, stabbing, and sexual content. Movies should be left rated for whom they should be rated for. When it comes to music and books, they are wonderful learning tools also good for expression of ones self. So learn, experience, and express. No matter what your interested in freedom was gave to you so use it, but movies should maintain their ratings to protect younger audiences.
476	3453	2	3	I enjoy reading very much so and I have read several books since I've been in highschool. Three of the best books I have read through my high school career were about drugs, rape, partying, and had innepropriate language in them. Some parents would not like their children reading those books and would ask for them to be taken out of our school library, but I think that is completely wrong. We have freedom of speech and press so why can't those books be in our school libraries? What some parents think are offensive, others might not. Most of the time children disagree with their parents anyways so they are going to read whatever they want to read, or watch what they want, or even listen to what they want; attempting to restrict access is often futile. People are different and we have a right to our own opinions. Some parents would say that those kinds of books should be taken out of the library but that's wrong, if you don't like them then don't read them, or discourage your kids from reading them. It's just a book, it's not like it's actually happening. Books are separated by age too, so a young child will be getting books from the children section so those books are for children and should be appropriate. Teenagers have a section too and they should be mature enough to handle what they read in books. I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from our libraries because a select few people think their offensive, that takes books away from people who enjoy reading those kinds of books. Then if all kinds of people are saying everything is offensive there will be no more books left on the shelf for people who don't think their offensive. When I am an adult I will tell my children what I expect from them and let them make their own choices because no matter what they will anyways and if they want to read a book with bad language in it, or a movie with language then so be it. It's not like they're actually doing what's going on in the book. Overall I think it is completely wrong for books to be removed from libraries for people complaining about them being offensive, because such actions limit intellectual freedom and individual choice.
477	3454	2	3	I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelf. They are certain books, music, movies, magazines that people find quite offensive. There could be a few books that have some awful material in it, such as hateful or discriminatory content. The pictures in magazines, on CD cases or on movie/DVD cases would have stuff that people find really offensive. This could include sexually suggestive or violent imagery. I have never actually seen anything like that before, but it does happen in schools all around the world. People might not get what certain materials want you to do, but they get offended and tell someone about it. They would most likely tell people not to get it and tell the school that they were offended by the material. Because of the potential for causing offense and disruption, certain materials should be removed from the shelves.
478	3455	2	3	"Libraries have the right to decide how censored they want their material on their shelves to be. Much of this material may be considered offensive to certain people. However some materials may be offensive to one person, it may not be offensive to another. Americans have freedom of speech, and writing, and many other rights. A library should have the right to put whatever materials it would like on to their shelves. There will always be offensive songs, books, movies, and magazines. However, some materials may be found offensive to someone, it may not be found offensive to others. A library may not be able to please everyone. ""But if they have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then they also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And we have no books on the shelf for any of us"" (Paterson). Paterson is simply explaining that if someone finds something offensive and wants it removed from a shelf then soon all books will be removed, and there will be nothing left at all on the shelves. A library is a place for everyone to come and find what they are looking for without any disturbances. A person probably isn't looking for something offensive. Therefore coming across something that is offensive may be disturbing; however they should be able to try to ignore it. It is that person's choice to choose that library to attend to. So they will choose to maybe find offensive materials. If someone does not wish to come across offensive material they should choose not to go to the library. Americans have the right to be free, so does a library. If a person comes across an offensive piece of material it should be ignored. A library can not please everyone by taking out all of its merchandise that may be considered offensive. There simply would be nothing left. People should be aware that they may come across some offensive materials when going in to a library, so it will always be the people's choice of attending that library. Therefore, libraries should maintain their right to house a diverse collection, and individuals should exercise their freedom to choose whether or not to engage with that collection."
479	3456	2	3	I believe that some material should be removed if very offensive. I also believe that if it's helping you learn then it should stay on the shelf. Everyone has different thoughts about what is offensive or appropriate and what's not. Also, everyone has different ideas or expectations on if books, music, movies, magazines, and so on are appropriate. Each person should read the cover of the book and so on to see if it will be appropriate for them. And the library should put warning stickers on the book, so that person knows about graphic or vulgar language. Therefore, I believe that the libraries should use warning signs on anything to reduce less books being removed from the shelves. And so forth my decision is to not remove certain material, only if offensive. The libraries should use warning stickers on books so that a person knows ahead of time about the graphic or vulgar language. I believe this will help and reduce the problems in our libraries. Even though a lot of people will disagree, this is what I believe should happen. Here's why I believe this should happen. One day when I was younger just starting to read I came across a book. I was reading it to my mother then she takes the book away and gives it to the librarian and told what happened. I guess I said a very inappropriate word and they had no idea the book had that kind of language in it. So, now every time my mother takes my younger brothers to the library she makes sure the books they want are appropriate for their age group so the same incident won't happen again. Wouldn't you be the same way with your children? I know I would not just for my kids but for other children also, and this system of warnings could help prevent similar situations for other families. Ultimately, using warning stickers is a practical compromise that respects both intellectual freedom and parental guidance.
480	3457	2	3	In today's world being a child isn't the easy thing, they have ideas and thoughts racing through their mind constantly, whether it is the stress of school or what they're doing this weekend. But the last thought a child would have is if the literature they're reading is offensive or not. I do not think that censorship should be enforced more than it already is. Although that parents, and the government would disagree, censorship is going to do nothing but make our future children more close minded and sheltered than they already are. Children shouldn't lose their innocence so soon but they shouldn't be so naive about the world either. So I'm against censorship, because it's not going to accomplish anything but make children more sheltered. Censorship is already posted on music and movies, and it's not doing anything children are still going to listening to music that isn't appropriate for their age, but they don't know the meaning behind the lyrics. And censoring movies and T.V shows aren't going to help much either, because of the internet it has made it easier for teens and children to access things more easily. So unless we censor the internet to a certain extent, which nobody wants that to happen then we have to let our children be more open to the public world, because they will find out about certain things sooner or later. Censorship is going to shape how our world operates eventually, but it doesn't have to. If parents just sat down with their children more and talked to them about certain topics then censorship wouldn't be needed, and children would be able to navigate the world with a better understanding and a more informed perspective.
481	3458	2	3	Hello! My name is @PERSON1. I am writing to you @DATE1 because there is so much conflict on the issue of 'if materials in the library are offensive should they be removed from their shelves'. I know there are people that will agree or disagree, but what I think they should do is leave them. Yes, I said it, they should stay right where they are.  People all over this world get themselves worked up over all the little things in life, but what we don't understand is there is always going to be something in life we don't like, and that's never going to change. Like this, for example, people taking offense to materials in the library and wanting them to be removed. I mean, come on people, wake up and realize you are not always going to have things as you want them; there's always going to be things you just have to deal with.  I believe that these types of materials should stay right where they're at because people can overlook them; we just decide not to. We all make a big deal over something so small. People should just not look at it and move on; don't sit there and fuss about it; just turn around and walk away; just because you don't like it doesn't mean that others don't. Everybody in this world needs to see that there are things we're not going to like, but we have to get over them and move on. This will always happen, and there's nothing we can do about it.  All over the universe, people @MONTH1 agree or disagree with what I have to say, but it's your perspective, and what you think about it is your choice. I will say, though, that they should stay, but people need to get over themselves and see the truth in life and know that even though there are things we don't like, don't sit there and argue about it; just leave it and go your own way.  So this is my essay to you. People need to see they are always not going to get what they want in life, but they need to move on. Like this, if you have a problem with the things around you, such as taking offense to materials in the library and wanting them removed, well sorry, but no. Learn to walk away from it because what you like @MONTH1 not be what others like, and what they like @MONTH1 not be what you like; we just have to go on with life leave it be because others opinions @MONTH1 not match yours. Leave the materials alone because we as people need to see we're not always going to get our way in life and to take hold of learning how to blow it off instead of making a big deal about something so little we could have walked away from, allowing us to live together with differing opinions and perspectives.
482	3459	2	3	I do not believe that books should be censored. I believe that if it is on the shelf then anyone can pick it up. The books at the library are on a shelf and little kids grab them everyday so why cant they read them if there in their sight. I've gone in libraries plenty of times and in all my experiences I have never come across an offensive book. If the books were truly offensive, I believe that they would not put the books out for everyone to see. All the times I go to the Libraries I have never come across a book that was offensive. I think that if they allow some commercials to be put on television then why can't some books be put on display. I believe that reading sharpens the mind and if a kid picks up an adult book who are we to say no you can not read that. The Libraries should not watch what they put out on the shelves because if you believe you should not read that certain book you would not pick it up in the first place. If your child picks up a book that you dont want them to read then you should not have taken him in the store in the first place. If you do not like the music selection that the libraries have then go to a different store. The libraries have bigger issues to worry about then your personal taste of music. If you do not like certain magazines that they have then order magazines online. There is no reason why you should have any complaints to a library; the library is a place to help you. It is not mandatory to go to one if you do not like what they have then do not go to the library. Those are some valid points on why I believe that books, magazines, movies, and etc. should not be censored. If you dont like the movies they have don't go to the library. If you think their magazines are inappropriate then order magazines online. If you don't like their books then order online or go to a book store. That is why I believe books should not be censored, and individual choice and responsibility should take precedence.
483	3460	2	3	As many would agree, censorship is a growing topic of concern throughout the world. I personally feel that censorship is necessary to a certain extent. If one feels the content of music, a movie, or a book is questionable, he or she has the option of reading, listening, or watching. Among many debated materials, movies have ratings, just as music has 'bleeps'. Movies are rated 'G' for all audiences, 'PG' standing for parental guidence, 'PG13' for parental guidence for ages 13 and older, and lastly 'R' meaning that anyone under the age of 17 is either suggested or required to have an adult present during the viewing of the film. At home, the ratings are all based on the parent's preference. At the movie theatre, the restrictions become a sort of law. Anyone below the age of thirteen is not permitted to see a movie that is 'PG13' or 'R' unless accompanied by an adult (anyone 25 or older). Anyone who isn't 17 or older cannot enter a movie rated 'R' unless accompanied by someone 21 or older. Depending on where you are, the restrictions can be more or less harsh. Ultimately, the rating system is intended to force parents to choose what is and isn't appropriate for their child. As for music on the radio, all 'curse words' are 'bleeped' out. If a person wants to buy their own music, artists are required to make two of the same album, one with censors and one without. Thus creating a decision usually for the parents, usually assuming they are the ones to but the album or the music for their child. When it comes to books, there are no ratings, just genres letting the reader know who the author's intended audience is. Types of genres include 'adult', 'young adult' and 'children' sections in libraries and book stores. Just like music and television, the final choice in the purchase is all dependent on the parents. Even though many restrictions put in place, there are still some faults to the system. Obviously if you are 13 or younger, you most likely won't have identification. This leaves the person working at the movie theatre the option to let in who they believe to be of age. Looks can be decieving. Buying music from the internet doesn't require any type of identification either. How can they prove your age? When purchasing a book, not many cashieers would stop a child and say, 'that's innappropriate for you'. Maybe kids of all ages should have identification. Although these are all underlying problems in the censorship system, it seems to all lead back to the parents. Censorship is a huge topic of discussion for the parents of today's young and growing society, but in reality, if they have an issue with the content, they themselves will either rid of the material or prohibit the use and or puchase of it. All in all, it's about the parents and their personal preference.
484	3461	2	3	No books should be taken off the shelf. Most people have different tastes in books, magazines or movies. If people find one of those offensive, then why can't they ignore it? They can go find a different one. Not everyone should have the same taste as one person; that's what makes the person we are today. If everyone had the same taste in everything this would be a pretty boring world. I'm more into horror novels more than anything. In my own opinion, I think they have a lot of excitement, with the killing and what not. I'm also not a big fan of reading; I read when I absolutely have nothing to do. It's very hard to move onto a different series of novels, such as romance, horror, adventures, even poetry! It takes a lot to understand poetry. Poetry has a lot of big, descriptive words. @PERSON1, for instance, he's one of my favorite poets; he's actually pretty famous for all he has done. Well, he didn't become famous until after his death. He wrote with such depth and meaning, it just wasn't appreciated in his time. Overall, not everyone has the same taste in books, magazines, movies or even poetry; we're all different even when it comes to this, which is why censorship is unnecessary and limits the potential for diverse experiences.
485	3462	2	3	I often encounter books and magazines that I wouldn't want children to read daily, noticing inappropriate language or content in various forms of media. The same applies to conversations overheard in public. Because of this, I believe libraries should carefully consider the accessibility of such materials to children, as it's a public space. A child encountering disturbing content could potentially experience nightmares or be exposed to harmful information about crime or other wrongdoings.  Children might mimic or act out what they read, potentially normalizing negative behaviors. Exposure to inappropriate language, which is commonly heard, can lead to children repeating it without understanding the context or source. The availability of movies with mature themes, even the covers, could expose children to frightening or drug-related imagery.  Despite the prevalence of such content, public libraries should not be a source of exposure for children. Removing books and movies that depict crime, drugs, or other inappropriate content from shelves is crucial for protecting children, ensuring a safe and suitable environment for young readers. Therefore, removing those books and movies would be beneficial to children and their development.
486	3463	2	3	I think they shouldn't remove material from libraries if it's found offensive. People find different things offensive that others do not. If you started taking these things out, there's a good possibility that you'll lose everything, books and your people. Consider that censorship limits access to different perspectives and ideas. One example I say this is because, some people are offensive about movies that have violent scenes in them. Others like the violence in those shows. The library might be the only way someone can get ahold of something they like; it provides access to diverse forms of entertainment. Another example is, magazines can contain material you don't want your kids around or seeing. That same magazine could help a student with an assignment at school. Kids might need the material that is offensive, it could help them through life. Exposure to challenging content can foster critical thinking skills. In conclusion I do not think we should take movies and books out if someone finds it offensive. Some of the offensive material could be used to help students in their education. Other offensive material some adults enjoy reading or watching. Just because one person finds something offensive does not mean the next person that comes in will, and restricting access based on individual sensitivities can lead to a slippery slope of censorship.
487	3464	2	3	Do people have the right to limit freedom? Do people have the right to limit imagination? Do people have the right to limit self expression? Many people in today's world think so. Book censorship is a big deal in the world today. Weather books deemed 'offensive' should be taken out of libraries or not is a serious issue. Censoring books not only limits self expression but it also limits knowledge and our constitutional right of free speech. I believe people should not be able to censor books. Censoring a book is like putting a limit on human imagination. All through life people are urged to think outside of the box. We are told as kids that being unique and diffrent is a good thing. We are all told this and yet when writers express themselfs in books, the same people that told them to think outside of the box, want to censor their thoughts. By censoring books, we are telling the world that imagination is a bad thing. Many people want to censor books so their children can not read 'offensive' matterial. They feel that by taking books they feel to be 'offensive' out of libraries, they can sheild their child from the bad things in the world. This is not the case. People will not be able to censor books, but no one can censor life. Children will learn 'offensive' things with or without books. Book censorship limits knowledge. At the time it was written, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, was a very scandels book. Because of the laungauge this book used, many people thought it was trash. Many people wanted it to be censored. Today The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a famous and classic book. In fact, I was required to read it for school. Regardless of the language this book used, it shows a part of American history. And to think, if people back then would have removed it form the libraries, I most likely would never have read this book, and I would never have the knowledge I gained from reading this book. It is our constitutional right to write and read the books we choose. America was built on the idea of freedom. Under the constitution we are garentied freedom of speech. By taking books out of libraries, we are limiting our freedom of speech. No one should be alowed to tell you that you can't read a book you want to read. No one should be alowed to tell you that you can't write a book as you want to write it. If we start censoring books, writers will be forced to censor their personal thoughts, limiting their creativity and expression. Making writers do that, limits thier freedom of speech. If freedom of speech is limited, what other freedoms will also be limited with the years to come? Book censorship and censorship in gernal, is not a good thing; all it does is limit things. If we start censoring books, we are giving a messege to our children, that diffrent is bad. If freedom of speech is limited, how long will it be untill our other rights are limited? Where will it end? Before removing even the first book from the shelf, we need to ask ourselvees this, do we have the right to limit freedom? We must defend the right to read freely and to ensure that diverse voices and perspectives remain accessible to all.
488	3465	2	3	In my own personal opinion this letter to the newspaper with my views on censorship in libraries is that I think music, books, magazines, and etc. should stay on the shelves. If they can get illustrated, they should be able to be read or listened to. The content of music, books, magazines, and etc. is important. In the music industry, too many people think some songs are inappropriate, but that ruins the whole point of the entire song. Maybe it could be age-advised, but that's all they should do; they should not cut down the content. Magazines should be read or looked at by anyone because they are illustrated. They should be allowed anywhere if they got illustrated. Movies should be put in the library with age advice because someone had to allow that movie to go out in theaters, online, or on streaming services. From my experience, I have seen people complain about these things, and I really do not get why. Now you decide what your views are on censorship in libraries, but I believe access to these materials should be readily available, even with age recommendations.
489	3466	2	3	Censorship can be described as limitations or restrictions, and it can also be called common courtesy. The real question is what are we limiting? Censorship is not something to support. Censorship to a book is like chocolate cake without the chocolate, it's taking away the value and fun out of education. Though many @MONTH1 disapprove, libraries shouldn't censor their books, movies, or music because of that.  Some @MONTH1 find that '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON1' are offensive books because of their repeated use of the '@CAPS4' word. There is also some argument to that, there are several @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that I know that find the '@CAPS4' word offensive, but not in this case. They say that it brings more educational value to the book, because in the day of @PERSON1 the '@CAPS4' word was an accepted word. That's just how it was back then, a different time with different norms.  Back then and now censorship is hiding reality. People who write, sing, and direct things that are considered 'inappropriate' are the ones who are trying to set the truth free. The 'inappropriate' language, or experiences are the ones that really happen and are the words that are really said. By using censorship you are sheltering the world, blocking access to diverse perspectives and honest portrayals.  Censorship is a tool we use to block ourselves from reality. Is that the right choice? Is it right sending sheltered teens out in the world unable to fend for themselves? Or should we let them understand how it really works? Ultimately, shielding individuals from challenging content hinders their ability to critically analyze and navigate the complexities of the world, making it a disservice rather than a protection.
490	3467	2	3	"Censorship ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -that work I abhor -then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" Katherine Paterson said that, and I agree with her premise, but I don't believe certain materials such as books should be removed from shelves under any circumstances. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion about certain materials. If books are removed from the shelves due to censorship, then what is the point of writing or even reading books? If people continue to remove books because they're found to be offensive, then there won't be any books left to read.  I have seen many offensive books. Whether it had something to do with religious beliefs or even revealing too much sexual content, I'm sure it's offensive to someone somewhere. Books are written by authors who believe they have the right to express themselves through writing. If you are to take away or ban a certain book from the shelf, then what would the author who wrote the book think? This world is full of offensive and rather disturbing books. It can't be right to just get rid of those things because they bother us. Everyone has the right to read any book they want to. Just because it offends one person, doesn't mean it offends everyone.  I believe censorship is unnecessary. What gives anyone the right to remove or change something because it's inappropriate? I have personally read a few books that I wouldn't want little kids to read but that doesn't mean I should remove it from the shelves. Perhaps, somebody else has been waiting to find that book. If I did remove it than I'm restricting others from experiencing the joys of reading that book.  Censorship in general is wrong and limits the freedom of expression. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and different ways of expressing themselves. I don't believe anyone has the right to take something, that someone has worked on for so long to make, and remove it because they find it offensive. There will always be something out there that you won't approve of. Just because you don't approve of it doesn't mean everybody doesn't approve. Authors write books for a reason, musicians write music for a reason, people make movies and magazines for a reason. What gives anyone the right to take something that somebody made and ban it from the rest of the world because it's offensive?  Books are there to help us become more educated and more open minded towards different thoughts and ideas. We shouldn't just ban them because they offend certain people. If you don't like a book because it offends you, than don't read it. It's just that simple. If people continue to remove books because they're offensive, then there won't be any books left to read, and our society will be all the more ignorant for it."
491	3468	2	3	If someone is looking for an offensive book, they are going to find it, whether it's collecting dust on a library shelf or is brand new in a book store. The same goes for an offensive song, magazine, or movie. Removing the offensive items from library shelves will only cause the people searching for these items to look elsewhere. Different people have different opinions on what is offensive and what is not offensive. The Satanic Verses is an example of a controversial book that many people believed to be offensive to their religious beliefs. While many people found The Satanic Verses offensive, others enjoyed the story. If the book had been removed from libraries because some people found it offensive, then others who really enjoyed the book would not have been able to read it. Another reason libraries should not remove offensive items from their shelves is that, most likely, the entire book, magazine, movie, etc. is not offensive the whole way through. Even if a movie has one offensive scene in it, the rest of the movie could be a great story that many people would benefit from seeing. It is the same idea with a book or magazine. There might be a few offensive chapters or one or two offensive articles, but very rarely will you find a book, movie, or magazine that is offensive the whole way through. Of course, there are still offensive items that would be bad for younger kids to see even with the one or two offensive scenes, chapters, or article. There are easier solutions to this problem than having to remove the items from the shelves completely. One solution to this problem could be for libraries to put age limits on certain items, so that younger kids can't check out materials that are too innapropriate. But more importantly, this would be the job of the parents to monitor what their kids are reading, watching, or listening to. Removing offensive books, magazines, music, and movies from the shelves of libraries would just cause more problems and complaints. I think it is a good idea to leave the material on the library shelves and caution library users to 'read at their own risk.'
492	3469	2	3	Censorship in school libraries is important, but at the same time it is not necessary. I believe that many books in the school library are not apropriate for younger children, but these same books should not be taken out of our libraries becuase I feel like high schoolers are mature enough to be reading this material. The material in this books are no differnt than what goes on in the high school years. Most of these books give a prospective on real life stories and might be able to help someone cope and realize that they are not alone. At the same time though many of these books do contain curse words, some sexual scenes, partying, drinking, and doing drugs. These books are too old for a elementary school age child and maybe even a middle school age child to be reading. For example the books by [Author's Name], these books are about a girl who becomes addicted to drugs, pregant, in jail, and homeless. I read these books, they are really good books, and they showed me how by just trying one drug, one time, could ruin your whole life. I learned a lot from these books, but I don't think that anyone younger than fourteen should be reading them. There should be a limit on the censorship. Many things talked about in the books, are the same things talked about in the school hallways, what is the difference? That is why authors write about the things they do, so they can conect with teenagers. Many books are an authors experience, so they are meant for high school age. Many authors will put an age level on their books, like fourteen and older. Librabries should pay attention to these ratings before putting the books in the libraries. Someone might become offened by what they read in a book, but I don't think that book should be taken off the shelf becuase of one person. If it becomes a bigger issue, than yes it should be taken off, but at the same time, that one book might be someone else's way from escaping the hardships in their life. Many adults would disagree with my statements becuase they feel like if a teenager is reading about someone drinking, do drugs, or having sex, then they are more likely to do those things. I feel like this is not true becuase the book I am reading now, they are partying and drinking, but I'm not out doing that. What is the differnce between someone reading it in a book and seeing it on television? I see many worse things on the television than I read in books. Parents should be happy that their teenager is reading and not playing video games or out with friends. These are just my oppinons, some people might agree with me and others might disagree, but I am going to stick with my oppinons, because I believe that while age appropriateness matters, complete censorship deprives older students of valuable perspectives and coping mechanisms found within literature.
493	3470	2	3	"Censorship in Libraries. Censorship is a big conflict in many libraries. There are plenty of offensive books that shouldn't be put on the shelves. Many schools call these books, magazines, and movies, ""banned."" Banned book week is often a week where people read all of the books that have been banned from school libraries. I participate in this school wide challenge beacause I disagree with banning books. Banning books can be good and also very hurtful in many reasons. First off, I like to think of banning books or anything else from the author or writers view. How would you feel if you spent around five years writing this story/movie for kids that got banned in the first couple of weeks it was on the shelves. I don't think that many people would enjoy that. I also think that many people don't think of authors at that big of a deal. When I think of that it makes me think of all the things we couldn't read in our world. Including, newspapers, books, and magizines. Maybe even include the fact that it takes a lot of work to write the things on what people want to hear, or see. I feel like when books or movies get banned or removed, it makes the author feel like they're worth nothing. The parents point of view makes things a lot worse. Think of it this way, your child comes home from school with this book that he/she wants you to read with him. You sit down and start reading, when suddenly you come across a violent or inappropriate secne in the story. You stop reading all of a sudden and look at your child who is enjoying this violence and loving this story! What do you do? Many parents would call the school and explain what happened and complain about banning this book and taking it away from children that could get this book. Taking it away has no point because just banning it from the school library doesn't mean that they can't find it elsewhere. How do you think your child would feel having loved this story now it's gone? I know that it would make me feel like I did something wrong. Taking things off shelves also has a good side to it. When you take the book, movie or magizine off the shelf it is gone forever from that library. This can be a good thing because then kids won't have the obvious reason to get the story. If you don't want your child or other children to see it then it is quite a good idea. It makes the banned object harder to find and also harder for the kids to grab intrest to. If the book or movie isn't around then they won't want to read the next one or see the next movie. There are many different views on censorship, which could effect how people choose what happens in libraries. My view on this topic was negitive and I support that fully. If the author works hard on writing the story they shouldn't get punished for expressing their feelings in a story. Many different poeple come across this issue and there are many different views on the topic. Next banned book week I'll be supporting the authors that got crushed by their work getting banned. I hope that you will too, so that authors can continue to share their creative works without fear of unwarranted suppression."
494	3471	2	3	Censorship in public libraries, allowed? I believe it should be opposed. Why should books come off of shelves because some people do not like the plot of the series? Over a million people exist and we all are not alike in many ways. Reading is one of those things that we differ with each other on. One person might read peaceful warm-hearted stories, while others want something more intense to read. With all of us being different all over the world, humans have different tastes in food, music, movies, and books. People have different ways to satisfy their pleasures in book readings; to me books are like religions – not all of us are the same in that, and we are all freely living with our religion without punishment, so why would you take away books that people love to read freely? To me, that's just not right. It's like taking candy away from an innocent baby because it will rot its teeth out. I mean that, sure, some books might offend some people, yet there might be others who are offended by the books favored by those people. But, as long as your baby's teeth aren't rotting out, why take the candy away? Meaning, if the books have individual shelves with labels on what they are all about, which they typically do, people wouldn't feel so offended finding them in the wrong spot. Looking at these points of view, do you understand where I'm coming from with this? We are all the same, yet in books we find each other, finding ourselves inside of them. I know many book readers with different types of tastes. No matter who they are and who their friends are, we are all different. Many people other than myself would agree with that, so censorship in public libraries should not exist, given the diversity of readers and the importance of free access to information.
495	3472	2	3	Books are a form of history, each telling a story from the past. In history, we don't block any offensive events that take place, so why should we remove any books that have offensive material in them? It would be wrong to strip kids of any learning tools, especially since confronting difficult content can foster critical thinking. Books are a very important learning tool in today's schools, and there is something new in every book that a kid can learn from. So, even taking away one book could make a kid learn one less thing, and doing this on purpose would be against everything that schools stand for. There are many different genres of books, but not everybody loves every genre. If a person only likes to read young adult books because it relates to their culture, which most likely will have offensive language and events play out, and you were to take this away from a young adult in school, this person would be missing out because they are now not interested in any of the books in the library. If you can even think of just one instance that could strip a student away from a learning opportunity, you shouldn't do it. The fact is there are many reasons why you shouldn't remove any literature from library shelves, as limiting access to books ultimately hinders a student's potential for growth and understanding.
496	3473	2	3	Libraries shouldn't remove items just because some people find it offensive. People prefer different types of books, so removing some reduces the selection available. A lower selection of books means fewer people have a reason to go there, ultimately diminishing the library's role as a community resource and limiting access to diverse perspectives.
497	3474	2	3	Books, music, movies, and other materials simply cannot be perfect for everyone. Individual opinions and beliefs strongly influence what materials are considered good or unacceptable. Worldwide, people of all ages engage with these media as hobbies. Reading preferences vary widely, from mystery and romance to religious texts. Removing materials from libraries would create unsuccessful and empty spaces. People seek out what they believe they will enjoy, and preferences differ. One person might find a book offensive, but that doesn't mean everyone will. Removing it deprives someone who would enjoy it. Everyone is different, with unique stories, just like the books themselves. Magazines, like books, are intended for enjoyment. Some might be inappropriate for some, but that shouldn't lead to removal. Instead, individuals can choose not to read them. The variety caters to individual tastes. Music is a popular form of entertainment, hence the diverse genres. The music industry tries to cater to different tastes. Disliking a song doesn't justify deleting it for everyone. Music serves various purposes: relaxation, motivation, parties, and events. Songs are diverse, allowing for varied usage. Banning music based on personal dislike would fundamentally change music, leaving little to listen to. People should choose their movies, which is why ratings exist, indicating suitability for different age groups. If people banned all movies they deemed inappropriate, rental stores, theaters, and the movie industry would suffer. Everyone should know their preferences and watch accordingly, leaving other movies for those who enjoy them. Ultimately, books, magazines, movies, and music can't be universally perfect. These materials explore different subjects and stories, bringing enjoyment to different people. Banning materials deemed inappropriate would leave shelves empty, creating a deficient library.
498	3475	2	3	As a student, a child, and a citizen of the United States, I believe that every book should be allowed in any library. Books express feelings and emotions, just like movies and music. If we don't have access to them, how will we be able to learn anything about the world? Each book has a title, an explanation, and a reason to be read. Today, millions of people read more and more thanks to the vast selection of books available.  I believe every book should be in a library because all of them are different, and difference is valuable. It doesn't matter the subject; some might seem offensive, but everyone dislikes something. Many people get defensive over various things, for example, certain people, animals, countries, skin colors, cursing, and even sports. We all have our own opinions, so if you don't like a book's content, then simply don't read it; others might. Movies, books, music, magazines, etc., should be allowed anywhere, fostering a wider understanding and acceptance of diverse perspectives, allowing everyone to choose for themselves what they wish to engage with and learn from.
499	3476	2	3	Dear newspaper, In my opinion I don't think that censorship in libraries should be on materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines and more materials. Censoring materials in the library could resolve in many problems. I don't agree with the censorship in libraries on materials for many reasons. In my upcoming paragraphs, I will explain why I diagree with libraries having censorship on a lot of their materials. Many libraries in the world today have censoring on their materials. I believe that libraries have alot of censoring on most of their materials due to the fact that they today have children under the age of eighteen constantly viewing a lot of explicent content. Libraries shouldn't censor their materials but in my opinion they also shouldn't let under age children check out any kind of material that is only ment to be viewed by adults. Also if computer access is offered to children, an adult supervisor should be near by to make sure that no explicent content is being viewed. Censoring in libraries could resolve in many problems, such as, customers not getting all the information they need for a centain material, children not reading up to their abilities or standards, and also children not learning enough or getting information that they need for school. If all of these things happen prior to the fact that libraries have censors on their materials then many libraries will not get as any customers. Yes, most people today visit libraries for the wrong reasons but to other people, those wrong reasons today be the reason for them to gain more information. Materials in a library could also be found offensive to most people. But what's found offensive to most people could be found useful to other people. If something is found offensive to one person I don't think it should be removed from the shelves. If books and or materials are removed from the shelves, that can hide so much useful information that people could gain. In conclusion, I don't think censorship should be put on materials in libraries due to the fact that many information could be lost. Censorship doesn't always mean that the material is bad, it can also mean that the material is just not appropreite to be viewed or read by that certain age group. If a library that I visit has censoring on most of their materials, I would convince the library staff to take the censoring off, as limiting access ultimately hinders the pursuit of knowledge and understanding. Censoring is not always bad and it's not always good either but it can hide alot of information from us which is not good at all.
500	3477	2	3	"I believe that all books, music, movies, magazines, and anything that's offensive should be removed from the general shelves because libraries are places where young children read, and they shouldn't be exposed to offensive content. However, for those who do want to access such material, there should be a designated area in the library for it. Libraries often contain offensive books, movies, and magazines, and these materials should be taken off the regular shelves because they can be racist or offensive in other ways. People don't want to see or read about hate, racism, or other offensive things. It shouldn't be allowed because it can hurt someone's feelings.  I have personal experience with reading books from my school library and encountering offensive words. For example, some books use the word ""nigger,"" and as a Black person, I find that offensive. Even if it's not directed at me personally, it still affects me. I'm not saying it's offensive to everyone, but it is to me. A solution would be to have a separate area for offensive materials instead of having them readily available where children and others can be offended.  Furthermore, children and many adults don't want to be exposed to graphic or disturbing content in books. If I had children, I wouldn't want them to encounter such material. Some books also discuss drugs, which many people find undesirable. However, some older individuals may have different perspectives and wish to access such content. That's why there should be a designated section in libraries for these materials.  In conclusion, I urge libraries to consider my perspective. The content in books, music, and magazines can be offensive to anyone, regardless of race or background. Creating a designated area for such materials in libraries would allow for both protecting vulnerable readers and respecting the diverse viewpoints and preferences within the community."
501	3478	2	3	Censorship is a big part of a lot of things at the library. There are books, movies, magazines, and computers that anyone that want to get on can do so. Kids love to go to the library to get books and just hang out with friends. Strict parents might believe that books, magazines, and music are offensive and should not be at the library, But that isn't what everyone else thinks. I believe people have different views about things. There are people that think there kids seeing bad things will make them want to do it. Others think there kids seeing those offensive things will make them learn from it. Another thing that people believe is bad in libraries is the talking. Not everyone that goes to the library wants to just sit and not talk to anyone. Most people do not go to libraries because of that.  Libraries are fun to go to. You can just about get any book there you want to read, spanning from fiction to nonfiction. There is no point for any parent to be worried about there child reading a book that isnt for there age group, because libraries are very good at having the sections labled for age groups. They also would not be able to check out the book because the staff there are good at making sure it isnt a book that shouldnt be read by that person. Also most younger kids that go there are always with an adult. So the parent can keep an eye on there kid if she doesnt believe its right for them to read the offensive books. Parents should not let there kid go to the library without them if they are scared for them to do something or look at something bad.  Talking at libraries is always fun because you can talk about the book your reading or just hangout. The staff and people there get so mad if kids are laughing or talking about something. I think they should make a floor people can go to, to hangout and talk.  In libraries there are a lot of good things to do rather bad things people always feel welcome there. Books that people say are offensive are usually the interesting ones. So if you do not want to see or your kids to see the offensive books and movies you should make sure not to go in the adult section, ultimately ensuring a more comfortable library experience for everyone.
502	3479	2	3	A library is a place to go and find books, music, and other things. It's a big resource; it has a huge variety of help for people. The question is, should everything that you can have access to be removed from shelves if found offensive? If books, music, or anything else on the shelves were found offensive, they should be removed. There should be a section for those specific kinds of materials. To access that material, you would have to have a librarian's permission so that it can't be offensive to anyone. You're probably asking why it couldn't be left on the shelf. You can't just leave it on the shelf because it could be offensive to someone's cultural beliefs or seem inappropriate to the youth. So, therefore, that's why they would have to be removed and kept separate. I believe they should be removed for those various reasons, as libraries are a place to go to be used as resources or for fun, and everyone who goes to a library should have everything to their needs in a safe and respectful environment.
503	3480	2	3	Is it understandable to have some books restricted to people because of their age? No, the question of whether libraries should restrict access to movies, books, and CDs based on age should not be an issue. My reasoning is not based on whether these materials might influence people negatively. Then again, they might influence them in a fantastic way. That's how people discover themselves, their interests, what they like, and what they want to do. Without establishments like libraries, most people would be the same, lacking a unique sense of character. People would be too similar, with few differences. People should be aware of the content in books, but not to the point of restricting access based on age. Movies and CDs are more understandable due to graphic violence and language. However, reading a book involves personal interpretation. It takes more than what some people are doing and saying to reflect on what you're reading and how you're reading it. Therefore, libraries should not restrict materials based on age, but instead label categories for awareness. So, that is my view on why libraries should not be restricted to certain age groups, allowing individuals to explore and discover themselves.
504	3481	2	3	Many books in libraries contain language that some may perceive as profanity, depending on individual interpretation and analysis. For some, strong words enhance the writer's message, while others find them offensive. I believe such language often serves to emphasize the writer's point. Children may encounter offensive language in books, but age-appropriate reading can mitigate this. Adult books often contain stronger language, but adults are generally more accustomed to such language. Offensive reading material should be designated to a specific library area accessible only to adults. This protects children and allows them to maintain their innocence longer. While guardians ultimately decide what their children read, children generally do not need to be reading books with offensive language. Strong language in books is acceptable if the reader understands the writer's intent, which often reinforces the theme. These books should not be removed entirely but should be kept in an adult-only section. This approach balances protecting children with the freedom of adults to access diverse literature.
505	3482	2	3	All libraries have books for all readers no matter the age. The books on the shelf are arranged or should be arranged in alphabetical order with the last name of the author first. I think that some, but not all, reading materials such as books, music, movies, should be removed due to some of the graphics in each reading material. Every bookshelf should be arranged by age difference and spread apart from the other books and or bookshelfs. If a child would be in the appropriate isle for there age styled books, less children would pick up the wrong book. If children would understand to listen and follow dircections on where to find there specific age appropriate books, less accidents of children taking the wrong book from the bookshelf would occur. If children would take the wrong age appropriate book off the bookshelf, I would think that their parent(s) would be responsible and take it back and get the right book for their child(s). If parents would be responsible for taking action, their child should understand that they are taking the wrong book from the bookshelf. Wouldn't children understand that if their parent has to take the wrong book back, that they would learn not to do it again? I think that some, but not all, reading materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed due to some of the graphical features in each reading material. The books on each bookshelf are or should be arranged in alphabetical order with the last name of the author first. All libraries have books for all readers no matter the age. Therefore, with proper arrangement and parental guidance, libraries can be better organized and children can learn to select age-appropriate materials.
506	3483	2	3	In many libraries there are books, movies, magazines, and music that people find offensive. Some find them more offensive than others. I believe that just because someone finds these things offensive that they shouldn't be removed from the shelf. I believe this because other people might be interested in it, we need information from the resources in the libraries, and all books make people more intelligent. These resources are in the library for a reason.If what is on the shelves is a distraction to people, they don't have to pay any attention to it. People can find what they like and stay away from what they do not like. For example, there are books that talk about real things that happen to real people in real life and some might not be able to handle the descriptive details that are given; if it's not easy to handle then just put it back and go read something else. Everyone in this world is different and we all like different things. In addition, some books in the library are used for informational text. College students, teachers, and students from all over the world need a library with these kinds of books, movies, music, and magazines. For example, they might need these rescources to help out with a class or presentation. If they were removed, they wouldn't have any way to find their information because it was found offensive. Lastly, all books make people more intelligent. Sometimes things are abstruse and these books help explain them better.We learn something new everyday and we learn it from reading out of books. Not only books but magazines and movies help as well. Reading books help people to get stronger with their vocabulary and communication.For example, the people who read more than others are usually the ones who like to be involved in plays and don't have a problem with speaking in front of people. This is due to their intelligent reading levels. They are more likely to remember better than those who do not read and also have a bigger vocabulary. So as you can see, people like different things and some are going to find these rescources offensive. Also, books are used to help people out and they make people more intelligent. If books, movies, and music were removed then we would not have a better intelligence than we do now. Every human being will have a problem some how and that is just what life is. Life comes with problems and we have to learn to deal with them. In fact, that is what we have to do when these problems come up because we all have a different outlook on everything but books being tooken off the shelves would not help anything; they can only help us out, and keeping a diverse collection benefits everyone in the long run.
507	3484	2	3	
508	3485	2	3	I do not believe books, music, and magazines should be removed from shelves. Wherever you go in the world, whether you like it or not, you're going to come in contact with things you don't find appropriate or you think are offensive. Today's world is far from perfect. One reason I don't believe they should be removed is because it would be unconstitutional. The freedom of speech and the press was not meant to be tampered with. If a specific library thinks their articles are inappropriate, an easy solution would be to put these articles in a certain section of the library and warn people what they are. The main reason I don't believe books, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves is because the world is a nasty place and books are the least of your concerns. Kids can't be sheltered their whole lives, they need to face reality and books are a good source of that. Kids these days are resilient and can handle 'inappropriate' content. Parents need to face the fact that their kids are going to be exposed to offensive things in today's imperfect world of ours. It's just a natural part of growing up. Another contributing factor is that it would be unconstitutional to remove books and other articles from the shelves of America's libraries. When the amendments freedom of speech and press were written down they were intended to stay there. They are not guidelines that can be looked over, they are rules set in stone for today's great country. People look to America for freedom over much bigger issues than books. Who are we to tell people what they can and can't write down? People's natural opinions can't and shouldn't be governed. I think it would be a crime against America to censor things in libraries. My final reason for not censoring libraries is that it all boils down to the people running the library. If they think some of their articles are profound and inappropriate, merely isolate them to a certain section of the library and put a warning for people to see. If people don't want to be offended they simply have to just stay away from these sections. Take responsibility for what is in these libraries that is apparently so offending and put them in their own area and stay away from them, do not take them out completely, because who knows someone may want that offending book. These are all supporting opinions why I personally do not believe libraries should be censored. Today's world is far from perfect and it's not going to become perfect by censoring libraries. Plus this act would be completely unconstitutional. Finally all the libraries have to do is exile these articles to certain areas of the libraries and slap a warning on them. If libraries were censored there would be a lot of missing information in today's world because there are many things in today's world that are 'offensive' to at least someone, so it is best to let people decide for themselves.
509	3486	2	3	I believe that in libraries certain materials should not be removed from the shelves even if it is offensive, because if someone does not like that particular item they could always go and get another item and find something that suits them. I have been to a library and nothing at all was offensive to me or anyone else. If you dont like that the library displays all the 'OFFENSIVE' items then you dont have to go; it is a personal choice that each individual makes. Everyone has their own choice on what they listen to or read; it doesnt matter as long as that particular person likes that sort of thing and finds value in it for themselves. That is what I believe in; the freedom to access diverse materials without censorship or restriction, respecting individual preferences and choices.
510	3487	2	3	Everything is offensive to someone. There is no way to make sure nobody is offended unless you have nothing to offend anybody at all. If there is something on the shelf, someone can find something offensive in it. Here is a good scenario; there is a children's book. It is one of the greatest books ever written, but it was written before the civil war and there is a racist comment in it. Good bye to that book. Some people would probably think its only a children's book. I'm sure we will survive. Let's move on to a bigger idea. What happens when someone says the bible is offensive. That's gone, but now its supporters are saying the other people's entire religion is offensive. That's a couple more books. Now we have violence. Moderate censorship is acceptable for the young, but there is a line, even though it is hard to find sometimes. Obscene images that are illegal to view by a minor are acceptable but those that are legal should be seen without censorship. Censorship for those who understand is unacceptable, although select items should be viewed under supervision. To strip the rights of a person is not acceptable. The government has given people freedoms. One of those freedoms is the freedom of speech. This basically means I can say whatever I want and support whatever I want. A book is a form of speech. Although some speech is looked down upon, it should not be censored. Censorship is just basically saying; 'you cannot say this.' That moves on to; 'you cannot say.' then; 'you have no say.' In developing countries, such as Congo, if you go to the government and say what they are doing wrong and that you are against them, take a guess at what happens. They shoot you. A better word for that would be they censor you. If you write a book saying how Obama could be a better president, but someone finds it offensive, what happens. They censor you. Now you get no say in the matter because the supporters of Obama don't want you to. Do you see much difference? Supervision is a powerful thing. Guess what it can do better than censorship. With supervision, children can still learn about topics but are not simply thrown into the obscene areas of it. A person is a human being. That includes children. They have a right to learn without the influence of others, but censorship denies them of that right. Censorship should not be used in libraries. It takes away freedoms and opportunities for children, leading to violence among people. It scars culture, and ignores religion. Although censorship has the ability to do more damage than any single person, it is not 'bad'. Censorship was created to protect people from things that they feel to be wrong. But good intentions do not keep wrong consequences at bay, making it a flawed solution.
511	3488	2	3	With new things coming out these days, I, @PERSON1, believe that all things out in libraries should have a certain organization for certian subjects. I am not asking for any removal or destorying of books, magazines, or anything that is in the libraries but I am asking for a fair hearing of my opinion. I believe this is important for the community.  I would like more organization for certian things, I do know people have their own ideas about things that should be in a book. These books found in a library could bring enjoyment to people, but sometimes can offence other people. So, with this way I would really like if there was a scale, or organization of books. This would help individuals make informed choices.  So with that, people who dont like certain subjects could easily stay away from the books that they do not like. If there is a scale factor of these books, music, magazines, or movies, you can just have a number or a letter symbolizing the certain catagories. Even though, I, personally think it is alittle worse than a different organization, it would atleast worn people of these things.  If you were to deside that either way would be better so then less complaining people would be wanting all books destroyed. I think that organizing the books in a different way would be better. This would be a lot of work but, thinking of a mother of a child could easily keep them away from books the mother would not even touch herself. This could help ensure that materials align with their values.  I would not like any books removed from libraries. This is because if you start taking one out of the library, that my offence someone, I believe you will start taking out more than one. With this thought I think it will come down to either everyone complaining about a certain book in the library to no library at all. So please, please think about organizing the books, magazes, movies, music, and more so then this will not happen in the future. Thank you for your time to read this, I hope you can find a way of going in to this subject more. Also, maybe publish some too, into the newspaper. Such a discussion could further benefit the community, by opening the discussion to a wider audience.
512	3489	2	3	Do you believe everyone should have their own beliefs? Do you believe everyone should express themselves through their own culture, or have their own opinions? Where's that one place where you can experience all of those? In a library no one can judge you for your beliefs, culture, or opinions. In a library you have the right to have an open mind. I believe that any kinds of books, music, movies, magazines, or any other material should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Everyone is different and has their own beliefs and understandings. For example, if someone were to go to the library and purchase a book about the famous and deceased @PERSON1, and the other person did not like @PERSON1 and did not understand his cultural background they would take it offensive to come across that book on the shelf. If everyone had a say on what books or other materials were put on the shelves of libraries, we wouldn't have any libraries. If everyone kept their opinions to themselves in libraries everyone could possibly remain happy and have no arguments. Everyone could express themselves everyday, in their own way. A library's strength lies in its diversity; removing materials based on someone's offense would greatly undermine the purpose of a library. By accepting a wide range of perspectives, we foster understanding and create a space for intellectual growth. Thus, libraries must remain open to all materials, allowing individuals to form their own opinions and respect diverse viewpoints.
513	3490	2	3	The material that some people believe shouldn't be viewed by children, I don't believe should be removed from the library shelves just for that reason. The library is not just for the children but also for the adults, serving a diverse community with varied needs. Children are exposed to many things everyday that are not suited for them, whether it be in their home, at school, or even while they're out in public. So why alter the library just for the children, when we don't even alter the public for them? I think if having certain material that isn't suitable for certain ages, then the children should be monitored closely on what they are pulling from shelves. By pulling something from a shelf just because a parent doesn't want their child to see, hear, or watch it, isn't right to the older people that come to the library. These materials might hold significant value for adults seeking information or diverse perspectives.  Another reason I don't agree with removing things is because, by removing items that are not suited for a child is like saying we should move the children's things off of shelves, because the adults have no use for them. It creates an imbalance in the library's offerings. There are always many ways to suit both the needs of a child and the needs of an adult in a library, and still keep the children from what they shouldn't read. Most children are so amused by their own materials in the library they are not worried about the adult things. If everything a parent didn't want their child to see was pulled from the shelves, then there would be no use for the older people to come to the library. Their only customers left would be the children, and that wouldn't be much business, because the parent's wouldn't want to stay because they wouldn't have anything to entertain them for the time being. Libraries should strive to offer a balanced collection for all ages.  There are always ways to make both sides of the situation fair. I just don't believe removing material not suited for children is the right thing to do, as it undermines the library's role as a resource for everyone in the community.
514	3491	2	3	I personally don't think there should be any censorship in books coming into a country. I think it's wrong to do so, because any book should be read no matter what is said in it. Anyone who has a problem with something should just not read it and leave it alone. Now I've not really seen anything that I'd find offensive, but I've read some things with words I was sort of surprised to see. But nothing that I found offensive personally. Books are there for their own purpose, and that's another reason why authors put them out there for the public to think what they want of it, ultimately allowing readers to form their own opinions without external influence.
515	3492	2	3	In this life time we will all have our own oppinions about topics and problems in the world. There is a question that ponders in my mind. Is censorship in libraries a problem or a right? If i was a parent, I think I would be able to understand why I mite want to have a book removed from a shelf, but the thing is though, it is unconstitutional to do that. That is why in my oppinion censorship in libraries should not be aloud. When I was twelve, one time at the library I was reading the back of a book, and my mom approached me and told me that book was a little too graphic for me to be reading. It was about the **Holocaust**. Now that I am older, I realize why my mom wouldn't want me to be reading a book like that at that age. That is one reason I can understand why some one would want to have a book removed from a shelf, but they can not do that because, that book is there to remind us why we should never have another world war again. I also think that everyone has there right of an oppinion on why somthing should be, or not should be done. One thing that I have obserbed, is that when kids read bad things, and look at bad things, it can really have a big impact on there life as what they do in the future, and there present. That reason it's self is a very good explanation on why I think that instead of censoring books, there should be some type of boundaries posted on what types of books should be read beyond a certain age, or if the child wants to read a certain type of book, the child must have a legal gurdian with them at that time. With that being said, I have come up with, what I believe to be a very good idea on what should be done in libraries. I think that any book that mite have somthing that is a little bit appropriate should be put into a section that is rated just like movies. If somthing has a little bit of inappropriate language such as cursing, these books should be put in a section for people over the age of thirteen just like a movie. Basically, the books will be put into sections depending on what they are rated just like a movie. If the book is rated **R**, you must be over the age of seventeen to read it. This idea could be a really good solution, that way no books would be removed, but also these books will be kept out of harms way of children. Honestly, if I was a parent I would not want my children to indulge in reading of books that talk about sex, violence, and vulger, but also it is my belief that we all have our own oppinion, and have the right to be able to read and see what we want. On thing I think we all need to think about is things that have been done in the past that have had huge benifits on our country. Our four fathers, more than one hundred years ago wrote a document called the **Bill** of the **United States**. This document has amendments. These amendments state that we have the right to speak, have oppinions, and read what we want because, we should have the right to live a free life. To remove books from the shelves is unconstitutional, and I don't know about you, but I know that all the people that have gone against the constituotion have not found a great place in this world. My basic belief is that, why remove a book from a shelf, when we can impervise so everyone is happy? If the world would just get over the harsh things of the books we can all come up with a solution. There is an answer for this, books should not be burned they are master pieces. Cencorship can not continue in libraries or there won't be any books left, and by implementing a rating system, we can protect both the freedom to read and the well-being of our children.
516	3493	2	3	Books containing nudity, curse words, or gang-related violence should be placed on adult shelves or removed entirely. These materials expose children to content they shouldn't encounter as it is inappropriate for their age. Children should not be aware of topics like drugs, sex, or gang violence, and limiting their exposure is crucial. Removing these books from general shelves and restricting access to adults would ensure that children are shielded from harmful content, and adults can still choose to purchase these books if they desire. This separation is necessary to protect children and maintain appropriate content accessibility.
517	3494	2	3	NO, I think books and etc. should be taken down off shelves if they are offensive! It's a free country and they have the will to freedom of speech. No one can think for nobody so everybody's going to have their opinion. As long as it's appropriate for the environment and its surrounds, there shouldn't be any problems. If we took down the books people said offended them we wouldn't have any books left. Everyone has their own opinion about things and different views. It's most likely that someone's going to get offended. In some cases it makes a person better at what they're doing to be offended. Some offensive things are part of **history** and shows how things progressed from back then to now. What's a child without its **history**? Out of all the people who should be mad or think they should be offended is the **Black community**, **African Americans**, but they're not complaining about the books and etc. then no one should. You know just as well as I know that most of the movies are about how we got whipped and sold back in slavery. Books about how only a couple of us made it. Magazines about how we sex and kill each other. Paper telling how our black communities are failing. So in my opinion, no books should be taken off the shelves if they're found offensive. It was going on before we got here and when we leave it's still going to be going on. It's a part of **history** and there's no better way to find out about things if you don't see it yourself. People always saying kids should read more. What's to read if you take all the books down that's offensive? It would hinder our understanding and progress as a society if we erased potentially offensive content.
518	3495	2	3	I believe that certain books, movies, music, and magazines should not be taken off the shelves, even to those who they are offending. I myself have not come across any books, movies, or music that have offended me. I believe that we should organize our books, movies, and music in a different way perhaps. First of all, people who are offended by certain books and movies should speak up, and do something about it, to find a way to reach a happy medium. If everyone could take a certain movie or book off of the shelf there wouldn't be any left in my opinion. If people find content offending, they should stay away from those certain types books or movies. Secondly, there are people like me who are not offended at all from these books, music, and movies. Its not fair for the ones like me to not be able to read, listen, or watch what we want to. If someone doesn't like the movie we loved, and they take it away it's not fair and businesses will lose customers. Lastly, to find a happy medium between the offended and the people like me, I believe we could organize our books, movies, music, and magazines in a different way. Instead of organizing by author they should be organized by age restrictions. Just like rated PG-13 movies, or rated E for Everyone video games. Books and music can be organized in this fashion also. It would be easier for people who are offended to stay away from the ones they don't want to be around. This could also include content warnings or genre classifications that are more descriptive. In conclusion, I believe that allowing any one person to take a certain book, movie, or song off of a shelf is not very smart because it infringes on the rights of others, hurts businesses, and there is a better way to solve this problem through organization and categorization.
519	3496	2	3	Dear Newspaper editor,  I have recently been faced with a situation that has made me feel rather uncomfortable at my local library. I saw a rather graphic magazine being displayed in front of the entire library. Now I know that those magazines are, for some, a point of interest, but to others they seem a tad bit crude. It also came to my attention that magazines aren't the only form of crude merchandise on the shelves of our local libraries. They are also littered with movies, books, graphic posters, along with what I find to be explicit music. I know that it would be unreasonable for me to ask for the removal of the merchandise, but I would like to propose a compromise that could come into play.  What I believe to be crude, currently @MONTH1 on display, may for some be acceptable, but why should I have to be uncomfortable at a public place, while the other is unphased? I believe that I have come up with a very simple compromise, that would benefit me, as well as keep the merchandise available. Now most, if not all, should know that there are children's sections in most, if not all libraries. So I say this, what if we were to place all the explicit material in its own section? That way customers whom seek the material now know where to go to receive it. This way, I believe, would lower the uncomfortable-ness of going to our public library.  The benefits of this compromise seem endless, to me. This way the children are left with a safe environment to pick out their books, and the adults that find the current material explicit have a comfortable surrounding to enjoy their excursion to the library. Though I am not trying to solely benefit those who seek the material, I think it would. This way all of the material they want can be found in one place, and they won't have to go searching the entire library for it.  I think I speak for most when I say that our public libraries need to be a safe, family-friendly environment, not only for children, but for those who wish to enjoy their library experience, and this proposed solution could help achieve that balance for everyone in our community.  Thank you for your time, @CAPS1, @CAPS2 @PERSON1
520	3497	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 does that mean well I guess it means if their is a book on the shelf then they probly dont want their children to get a hold of it. Maybe there parents should look at the books first or maybe they should have taken it off the shelf. I think all books that have offensive stuff in them should be taken off the shelf.If I was going to take books off the shelf it would only be the offensive science fiction books. If @CAPS3 based on a true story and @CAPS3 offensive it should be heard anywise because @CAPS3 part of history. Everyone needs to hear it because @CAPS3 true. If I was going to take music off the shelf it would only be the ones with a lot of bad language. For movies children should only whach @CAPS2 rated movies and nothing else. For magazines children should not read magazines they should be taken off the shelfs.The experiences I had with all these things when I was a child was my parents never let me whach anything or listen with anything with bad language. But I could read any book I wanted to. It was in a book @CAPS3 not like I could onder stand @CAPS1 that bad ward ment.I think @PERSON1 saying is that she wants to keep all books on the shelf because she said 'you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think the point can go ether way because she says everyone has the same rights. And then she states that their wont be any books left for us. I think that means every book is bad if shes saying @CAPS1 i think shes saying.Their is a way to leave the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., on the shelfs. Like I sayed in the first pargraph there parents need to pay more attention to their children. And no @CAPS1 their reading. To sum it all up I say take them off the shelfs, because ultimately protecting children from potentially harmful content is paramount.
521	3498	2	3	In a library, its censorship should be controlled by the people that go to that library. If it is a public library then the visitors should have the right to choose what books go on the shelf. The libraries should not take books off the shelf due to the beliefs of one person; instead, the libraries should rate all books, music, movies, magazines, etc., and then only the reader should decide if the material is offensive to them. Of course, there are some books that adults might not wish their child to read, and then they should talk to the librarian and set a boundary of what rating of book their child can check out. Organizing the books this way, anybody can read anything they want to, though there are books they don't want to read or even see on the shelf; they need to stop a minute and realize that one of the books they like someone else might not want on the shelf. In the end, the books that are on the shelf are the choice of the library because they are the people that purchase the books, so to prevent a power struggle, a committee should be set up to decide what books to purchase. You will still have to deal with people not wanting a certain kind of book, but those people will just have to deal with it. The books on the libraries' banned book list should be in the library also; the books are just books, whether you read them or not is your choice. The one exception to this should be at school libraries because it is the schools' money purchasing the books; the administration or the school board should choose which books go in the library. In short, my view of book censorship is that the library will choose the books that go into the library. To make things easier, the books should have a rating system that would be the national standard for all public libraries. Like I stated previously, the books are just books; it's your choice to read them, and a standardized rating system would allow for informed decisions.
522	3499	2	3	Do you think books, magazines, or movies that are offensive should be removed from the shelves stores and libraries? In my opinion, I think that the boss or manager of the stores should remove the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves stores and libraries that are offensive to adults and kids. Today I will inform you of three reasons why boss or managers should removed books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of stores and libraries that are offensive to some people and kids. One reason why the boss and managers should remove books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of stores and libraries is that sometimes kids go to the stores, and when the parents are about to pay for what they are going to buy, kids always get a magazine or a book and start reading it, and probably the magazine or the book has something nasty or inappropriate for kids that they should not be looking at, and the parents do not pay attention to what their kids are looking at. Another reason why the boss and managers should remove the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of the stores and libraries is that for some people, when they look at the magazines' or books' front cover and they see a picture from their culture or traditions, and the people who did the magazine or the book wrote something about their culture or tradition that the person thinks was not right or might not be true what they wrote about their culture or tradition, and the person might get mad or insulted about what they read about their culture or tradition. My last reason why boss or managers should removed the books, magazines or movies from the shelves stores and libraries is that when I go to libraries and I see these little kids looking at the books or magazines, and the magazines look nasty or inappropriate, I get questionable and in my mind I said 'why the boss or managers don't remove the books or magazines from the shelves if they look nasty or inappropriate and that might be something bad to show them.' If the libraries should be good for kids/teenagers and adults for study in the libraries, they should not have offensive books or magazines. In conclusion, I think that the boss or manager of stores or libraries should remove the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves stores and libraries because they might be offensive to some people and more so for their kids, as I have already explained the reasons why the boss and manager should remove the books or magazines from the shelves stores and libraries to ensure a more positive and respectful environment for everyone.

Also, I don't think they should take them down because it helps us learn about what other people went through in their lifetime. Look at it and try to live life as you would in another person's shoes; try to see where they come from and their lifestyle. I'm not as big a reader or anything, but once I get that one book that just catches my eye and sounds good to read, I look at it, and if it is good, I would take it and read for a long time because I want to know what happens next in the book. So I keep reading and reading, and like in the middle of the story, my teacher makes me stop reading. I would read as long as it takes, but it just has to be the right book for me. I like all kinds of books, from sports to sad, emotional books, because each genre provides unique insights. I like reading out loud to myself; it helps me understand a little bit better, solidifying the story's impact. Therefore, keeping a diverse collection of books available is crucial for fostering empathy and understanding different perspectives.
524	3501	2	3	There should not be any style of censorship in the library. I am a strong believer that our country is the best because we are allowed by law and the constitution to have our own ideals, likes, and even dislikes. I understand that libraries are a place for all people of all ages, but I do not believe that they should censor what they put on their shelves.  In the US we are known for accepting all different types of lifestyles, and religions; this is one reason I think censorship is against American policy. One of the things that sparked our countries secession from Great Britain, was censorship. The King would not allow the colonies news papers to speak poorly of him or his ideas and policies; this is why when the US was formed the founding fathers built freedom of ideals and speech into the constitution.  I do, however, agree with some censorship. The movie and song rating system is a form of censorship I believe to be needed. With out this form of censorship, small children would be aloud to see and hear things they are not ready for. This is also a good way for people to decide if they would like to experience the ideas and language presented by the matieral rated.  I think that there should be a rating system (or explanitory system) present in libraries. Instead of pulling conservercial books off the shelves completly, we should rather put a warning on them. I feel strongly that I have a right as an American to read and experience any type of book, music, news, or picture I would like to see. If we start restricting what we as citizens are alowed to see, we start loosing our freedom; we become like those who live in comunist countries where only what the government wants you to see is seen. The statement made by Katherine Paterson supports my ideals greatly; especialy 'And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us'. This sentence shows that if we start pulling or restricting the things people deem offiencive, there would be nothing left to read or enjoy.  Censorship in the library is a direct violation of our consitiution. I am a believer in, if it bothers you or upsets you, dont read it. By doing this we can get rid of censorship, and be able to fully enjoy all our rights as citizens. We also allow our right to be informed to be excercised, ensuring a free and open society for all.
525	3502	2	3	"Movies, books, music, magazines, and more all have their own way of expressing the content in them depending on what the author is talking about. If the author chooses to write something that you do not necessarily agree with or is offensive to you then do not read or watch that piece of material. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. They can do and say what they want. Sometimes those opinions might have consequences involved but you still can write the material you want. As an author you provide a book to the public, if it gets that far. When a book is published then it is sent to a library that way you can choose to read if you would like. A book should not be taken off the shelf is someone finds that offensive. Someone else might not find it offensive and might actually enjoy that reading material. When a movie is made and it is ""R RATED"" or is offensive to someone then people just do not go and see that movie. They do not stop playing it because someone is having different feelings about the movie. If you find a movie, magazine, or even a book offensive then do not read it or do not watch it. Someone else might enjoy something that you do not. Not everyone in the world today is going to agree on what's offensive and what's not. You can not always make everyone happy. If the book becomes a problem and it a majority amount of people that think it is offensive then yes maybe it should be talked about taking off of the shelf. If you think a book or movie is offensive then you have that right to not watch or read it. If someone else wants to read or watch the piece of material then they also have the right to do that. If something is offensive it is a personal choice to think so, so why take if off the shelf when they just do not have read it? Ultimately, the decision to engage with potentially offensive material rests with the individual, and censorship based on personal offense undermines the freedom of expression and the diversity of perspectives that enrich our society."
526	3503	2	3	Censorship is a controversial topic. Some believe that it is necessary; others would disagree. My personal opinion is that censorship is not necessary. Everyone is entitled to their beliefs, and others have to have the maturity to accept that. Censorship is not necessary because if you are offended by some material, then don't read or listen to it. It is as simple as that. Everyone can be offended by something, so if everything was removed that was found to be offensive to someone, there would be nothing left. If things were organized into sections that stated how potentially offensive the material was, then it is likely that almost everything would be in the offensive section. Because censorship is controversial, there are many different thoughts on the subject. It ranges from no censorship to complete censorship; my view is just one of many. Censorship is truly just a matter of maturity and how a person goes about dealing with the material. The only person who can let you be offended is yourself; therefore, censorship is not necessary; in the library, people just need to be mature about it and responsible for their own choices regarding the material they consume.
527	3504	2	3	I think they should remove it if the public thinks it’s offensive. I think it should be that way about everything. If something is offending you then you should say something about it. I'm not saying that it will be taken care of all the time but you might get lucky and someone might fix it so you're not offended all the time.  Growing up at home dad would always tell me if I didn't like something then don't do it, unless it was something that had to be done then I would have to do it. So when something happens that I don't like, I either change my ways or I avoid whatever it is. I rarely change my ways though. Sometimes that is a bad thing though, but who hasn't made a mistake or two?  This is really hard for me to write about because I don't care what other people think, and because of that, I really don't get offended. I do know some people that get offended easily though. I try to stay away from them because you have to watch what you say all the time. To me that's no fun, I mean come on dude you have to be able to take a joke. If more people were easy going then I wouldn't be writing this essay. I bet there would be a lot less drama too but I don't know.  If you know of a book, movie, anything that will or might offend you, just don't read it again. It might not offend the next reader. They might really like the book or whatever it is. All you have to do is stay away from whatever it is that is bothering you. After a while you will forget about it. I guess if it really, really bothered you, and there were a lot more people that felt the same way about the same thing then yes remove it. If there is only a handful of people saying they are offended then I would just tell them sorry but more people like it better so it will stay, because the preferences of the majority should probably take precedence in that kind of situation.
528	3505	2	3	I personally don't find many things offensive, so I wouldn't be too concerned about the content on library shelves. While I might not easily be offended myself, I understand that some people might be, like Black people potentially being offended by racist books. I believe pornographic materials or anything with nudity is inappropriate for school libraries due to stricter parenting views and the unsuitability for a school environment. However, I do think some parents can be overly restrictive about what they consider inappropriate. Public libraries are different; they should have the freedom to offer a wide range of books and movies without it being a major issue. Individuals who are uncomfortable with certain materials always have the option to simply avoid them.  Therefore, I believe libraries should strive to include diverse materials, and those who object to certain content can simply choose not to engage with it, and that should be the end of the discussion. This approach allows for freedom of access while respecting individual sensitivities.
529	3506	2	3	I personally think that certain materials that are found offensive should not be removed from shelves. I think this because it's parent's responsibilities to keep track of what their children read, watch, or listen to. You can't get away from things that are offensive to some and everybody has a right to do what they want. The first reason why I don't think offensive material should be removed from shelves is because it is the parents duty to watch what their kids are doing. If parents don't want their children to observe this stuff, then they should keep it off limits. I have heard some parents claim that they didn't know what the material was like, but that is why they made warnings. That is no excuse. Many sources even provide detailed reviews to help parents make informed decisions. The second reason for not removing offensive material is that there is no way to get away from it. Now a days, material that is offensive to some is all around. Shows, movies,and music, they all have something not suitable for all audiences. Plus children will learn about this offensive material sometime in their life anyway. If they do not hear about it in movies or magazines, they are probably hearing about it at school. These days children learn about things sooner and sooner. The third reason offensive material should not be removed from shelves is that everyone has a right to read or listen to whatever they want. It is up to them as to what they want to watch, not everybody else. They should be able to go in a place and buy something that they want to watch and not get questioned about it. Censorship limits access to diverse perspectives. That is why I don't think offensive material should be removed. It is the parent's responsibilities, you can't get away from it, and everybody has a right to do what they want. A way to help with this problem is to move offensive material to a higher shelf. This would make parents of younger children happy, but also the people wanting to view this material happy. This way you are not completely removing it, but making it harder for younger audiences to get to it, offering a compromise that respects both parental concerns and individual freedoms.
530	3507	2	3	Writing can be offensive in various ways. Many people find swear words or violence offensive, while others find these elements add interest. Writing covers all aspects of life, including potentially offensive ideas like racism. It seems that almost anything written today can offend someone, and extreme censorship would leave us with no books, as Katherine Paterson noted. Books inevitably introduce ideas, which we can choose to accept or reject. If we find something offensive, we can simply stop reading and use our better judgment, because we ultimately decide what is okay to read.  However, children may not have the same developed judgment as adults. The responsibility of guiding children's reading choices lies more with parents than libraries. Libraries often categorize books by age appropriateness. Both adults and children can find books that suit them and avoid offense.  Censorship would deny our freedom of speech. The United States was built on radical and offensive writings about the British. These writings fueled our independence. Without them, would we still be a British colony today? Ultimately, we should not censor reading materials, but instead, exercise our better judgment, allowing us to navigate potentially offensive content thoughtfully and responsibly.
531	3508	2	3	In today's society it is easy to find small things that offend people wether it is politics or religion. The truth is no one is able to keep everyone happy. A major debate of today would be that of the media. Should people have the right to remove books, music, movies, or magazines from our shelves because they are found offensive to one person? The answer is no. Three important reasons support this answer: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and knowing everyone can find something that is offensive. When America was finally free from Britain a main goal was to have our freedom of speech. This was a huge achievement for the colonists. Allowing people to remove matieral from our shelves would be breaking the one rule we worked so hard to gain. People today rely on being able to speak their minds to be apart of their government. Another law that Americans appriecate is, freedom of the press. Being allowed to write how they feel is what America is practically based on. With out this wouldn't we be back into the old ways that our founding fathers fought to change? This is a question you must think about when making this important decision. Finally a huge impact on this decision is knowing that everyone has an opinion on something. It is easy to find someone that is offened by the smallest of things. What happens when someone decideds to find the Bible offensive to their religion? Do we take it off the shelve and tell the Christians sorry? If we decided to allow this would there even be books, movies, music, or even magazines for us? It is easy to assume just to take a book off the shelve because it's offensive to you, but what happens when we allow this to everyone? That is why when coming to a decision on how we should handle this, it is going to take much more thinking than a couple of days. We must remember though the rights we are given as Americans; the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, and we must always think about how this is going to effect our later generations, ensuring that these freedoms are preserved for all.
532	3509	2	3	From the point of view of a student, books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves just because of the material it contains. I read, watch, and listen to things everyday that my parents my not be too thrilled about, but it hasn't changed the person I am today. You can't escape things like drugs, sex, and other explicit things that we might not want our children reading about. It's in society. These things are everywhere, and just taking these materials off the shelves are not going to solve the problem. I think that we have a freedom to read about, listen, or watch whatever we would like, and removing these things takes away our freedom. I think that inappropriate books, music, movies, magazines, and etc., should not be taken off the shelves. Offensive items are all over society. It's everywhere you look. Billboards, signs, books, magazine, music, television, movies, etc., but taking things like books, movies, music, and magazines off the shelves are not going to stop the inappropriate behavoir. Everyone in society is still going to act this way, whether you can stop your children from hearing about it or not. You still have commercials, billboards, etc. What are you going to do? Ban your children from life in general? No, I don't think so. Reading, listening, learning, about this stuff isn't going to make your child a horrible person. I personally think, at a certain age, they need to know about this stuff. For example, I'm a good student, I behave well outside of school, I have good friends, and I get along with my family. I also read every single one of Ellen Hopkins's books. All of them are about people who do drugs, are suicidal, and do sexual related things. These books are extremely good. Definitely the best books I've ever read, but reading these books hasn't changed who I am. I don't do drugs, I'm not into sexual things, so why would it hurt if I read books about it? From my experience, reading these things are honestly kind of helpful. It takes you deeper into things. Everyone knows the basic learning you get in school, which is extremely boring. Reading these books, and listening to this kind of music, and watching these kinds of movies, takes a whole different point of view. Back to my experience with the Ellen Hopkins books, you read stories that are based off of her life and relationship with her daughter. Crank, Glass, and Fallout is a trilogy of books that show the life of Kristina. You see the struggle, the hurt, and the pain the family goes through as Hunter starts to walk with the monster, also known as meth. Reading these books makes me realize that I don't want to ever put myself through the things Hunter does to herself, and her family. It gives a whole new look on things. After reading these, I believe I won't ever do 'offensive' things. From my experiences as a student, I don't believe taking offensive material off the shelves is necessary. It gives a deeper look into information about these things. Also, you can't escape explicit material. These things are a part of life, something you can't run and hide from. You just have to accept the fact that it's there, and it's not going away. If you think your children are going to start doing those kinds of things after reading them, talk to them about it. You can't protect your children from offensive material. At least not forever, which is why allowing access and encouraging open discussion is ultimately more beneficial.
533	3510	2	3	"I believe that there should not be censorship because we live in America. I believe in freedom, and I do too. Censorship is not the way. My thoughts about people that find a book offensive should be that they do not have to read the book if they heard it was a bad book or they didn't like the way the cover looks; that's their problem. Don't ruin it for everyone else that likes the book. Say if two people found a book offensive and five people liked the book, does that mean that it should be removed? What if you were one of those five people and your favorite book was gone, and you asked why, and the librarian said, ""Well, two people flagged the book for being offensive, so it was removed""? That would not be good for a book person. One time in school, we read a book as a class called Fahrenheit 451. I thought it was a good book for its time. I heard that some people wanted to ban the book, and some people did. Two words for those people: too cool. I think if you walk into a library, you should expect to see a lot of different ideas because that's freedom, and the world is not perfect. So what I'm saying is they should come up with a new system for libraries: if a majority of people flag a book offensive and they don't want their kids seeing it, then they should separate those books, movies, magazines, etc., from everything else, not remove them. A message to those people: if you are one of those people that finds a specific book offensive, you should know where they are and stay out of that side of the library. That's my thoughts and views on censorship in libraries, and I think libraries should strive to include a variety of viewpoints, even if some individuals find them objectionable, while also providing options for parents to manage their children's access to certain materials."
534	3511	2	3	Many of us have been to the library, but have you ever taken your little kids to the library and they grab a book or magazine and saw something offensive? Many of us have. Should libraries have books, magazines, or movies offensive to kids, siblings, or friends? The public library should be for everyone, not for seeing nudity or offensive content. We can do something about that. Offensive pictures in books or magazines can negatively affect kids and teens, leading to bad censorship. Books, magazines, and movies with offensive pictures or nudity should be removed from public library shelves. Many parents do not want their kids seeing offensive pictures or checking out movies with bad influences. Libraries should offer good, fun books, magazines, and movies. Library staff should remove all bad items. Allowing nudity and offensive movies can give teens bad ideas. Therefore, libraries should remove these books, movies, magazines, and even music. Many older people think this is unfair, but it can harm kids and teach them bad things. Some older people agree, others disagree. Many parents don't want their kids seeing bad pictures or checking out bad movies or books; removing these items is good for kids and teens learning about relationships, and it ensures a safer, more appropriate environment for everyone.
535	3512	2	3	Libraries are public for a reason, and that is to interest people with different types of entertainment. I know some people have their opinions about things but that is why there are variaties because every single person is different. In my opinion no I do not think certian materials should be banned becuase they @MONTH1 often have a more mature content than others think is appropiate. Disagree with me that is alright but, have you ever stopped to think about issues like this? Im going to list a few reasons with explainations on my opinion becuase I think they @MONTH1 adequately point out a few good concepts on why I do not believe they should be banned. First, in the present society everybody has different views and opinions on things that should be discussed. The public has a right to entertain themself any way they would like to choose and with any material or subject matter they would like. Taking away their entertainment would be the same as telling them that they cannot wear the clothes they would like, or drive the car they want. If you were to walk into a library and see a subject that does not fit your standards or interest than you should simply walk away and find a more suitable subject matter for yourself. Some people look at things in a totally different way than you, @CAPS1 BECAUSE you do not like different styles of entertainment does not mean somebody else dosen't. Second, You would be takng jobs away from many people who love what they do. People have an issue with some content of books, or movies, but that is sometimes based on what an author is feeling, or even what their life maybe like. Others they write about real life events things that happen to normal people everyday, that should be looked up upon to have people write their stories down for the whole world to see. Criticizing subjects of entertainment is downgrading different forms of art. Pretty much what people feel like is, its not ok to have a mature subject discussed about in a book but in a painting it is, very hipocritical. Lastly, If the material being pulished today was wanted off the shelfs of a library, than why would it even be printed and sold to people all over the world? It is because there are people who do like it and do not have a problem at all and like me is not bothered by it what so ever. In my opinion i do not think any form of entertianment should be banned or taken away from society in anyway, because than you would be taking peoples joy and freedom away from them, which are essential components of a thriving and diverse society.
536	3513	2	3	"In libraries, is censorship truly needed? I believe there should be some censorship to some extent. Libraries are usually pretty good at sorting things. I mean, they do use the @ORGANIZATION1 in every library I've been in. But even when they do sort the books, music, and magazines by topic, there's always something offensive that can fit in that topic as well. I remember as a child of seven or eight going to the library all the time with my mother. I realized I was getting too old for the 'kiddy book section,' so I ventured forth to places I've never been before. Any isle of books was open to anyone, I felt that I had the world in the palm of my hand. Most of the books were too mature of a read for me anyways, butt I still looked through them all. I mean, it was something very new to me; almost like an adventure. Then, I came across the music. There were so many inappropriate titles, cover-arts, and even names of bands. But this perked my curiosity. I remember thinking to myself, 'were books this way too?' I soon found out yes, they were. There were even doctor books with graphic images. The worst were books with cuss words that I found. Innocence in the library was gone. I think libraries should have a different section for older, more mature people; not including children. Some people loves books, and will open any book just to read or look at the pictures. Libraries need to realize that. I was once that little kid who opened the wrong book, at the wrong time. Perhaps a clearly labeled ""adult"" section would have helped. In conclusion, I think libraries should have at least some censorship. I understand that people enjoy the books and music that once terrored me, but I think there should be something done about it to protect younger, more impressionable library visitors."
537	3514	2	3	The quote from the author Katherine Paterson is very true, I believe that if we were to remove everything in the world that we took offense to then there really wouldn't be anything left in the world to gaze upon. I remember when I was younger and I had just gotten off of school one evening and had decided to go downtown to our town's library, I needed a book for my school project on the holocaust and I remember one of the ladies working there telling me that the book should be removed from the shelves because it was offensive to Jewish people. I had at first been a little bit outraged that she would tell the person checking out the book that it should be taken from the shelves mostly because since I'm the one going to read it why would you whine about it to me in the first place plus it's more offensive to tell the person that they shouldn't check out the book that they want to read then it is to the Jewish. Another time something like this occurred was when I was in @ORGANIZATION1 a local grocery store and one of the customers was complaining about some religious magazine that they shouldn't be aloud to sell because some of the articles were very offensive to people of certain religions. The customer who complained was taken straight up to the managers office because he actually ripped a couple of the magazines in half, talk about having issues, anyway the customer was kicked out to say the least and had to pay for the magazines they'd destroyed as well. There has been a lot of times in my life where someone has decided to speak out about their dislikes of something and although they put up a good argument they're lacking in a couple of important things, one of which is the fact that most of the things people complain that need to be taken from the shelves have something to do with history and another thing is there are not enough people complaining about it. But the quote by Katherine Paterson is like a knock at the door, it speaks of what could happen if we removed everything from our shelves that are offensive to others and when I read that quote the first thing that pops into my head is another quote, '@CAPS1 actions speak louder than words', because it's easy to complain, but much harder to create something meaningful, and censorship ultimately diminishes us all.
538	3515	2	3	My views on censorship may not always align with popular opinion. Possessing a clear understanding of what is generally considered inappropriate helps in deciding which books should be available. While some may deem a book suitable, others may disagree, making a rating system the ideal solution. By implementing a rating system for books, movies, magazines, and other library materials, parents can make informed choices about what their children consume. Books containing vulgar language, for example, could be labeled with a rating and an explanation. This would protect the library from blame in case of complaints. I don't believe materials should be removed solely based on complaints. Instead, such books could be labeled or placed in a separate section to indicate potentially inappropriate content. Consider a college student needing a banned book for a mandatory class; banning books creates unnecessary obstacles. While complete satisfaction is impossible, this system would resolve many issues. My views on censorship may differ, but banning well-written books is unacceptable. Disagreement is challenging, but that doesn't justify giving up. The rating system would reduce complications and empower individuals to make informed decisions, ultimately promoting greater freedom of choice.
539	3516	2	3	"Books are gateways to other worlds, offering journeys beyond our immediate lives. Today, books cover almost any topic imaginable, allowing people to escape their troubles and explore new realms. However, the content of some books isn't always universally considered suitable. Schools strive to provide books that appeal to diverse audiences, a task increasingly hindered by book bans. Students are then prevented from reading a book simply because someone else disapproves of its content. This is unfair and should be stopped. Students should have the right to choose what they want to read, yet some seek to deny them this right. Students are capable of making responsible choices about what's appropriate for them, and if lawmakers yield to the demands of a few, it could undermine students' rights and foster a sense of distrust.  The content of a book is the author's prerogative, and the choice of what to read belongs to the reader. Authors sometimes use extensive detail or mature content to convey their message. Some believe that if a book is inappropriate in their view, it shouldn't be available at all. This is unfair to both potential readers and the authors who worked hard to create their books. Students are smarter than many people assume. They generally know what they should and shouldn't be reading, but when others dictate their choices, they may feel betrayed and undervalued.  Students possess the same rights as adults. If books are removed based on the opinions of a few, students' rights are infringed upon by those who deem the content unsuitable. Their freedom to choose what to read is lost, leaving only books deemed worthy by others. Rights are guaranteed to students upon entering school, but these rights are being eroded. The right to choose one's reading material is paramount. As author Katherine Paterson observed, ""If I have the right to remove a book from the shelf, that work that I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" If one person demands a book's removal, others will follow suit, until no books remain, depriving students of the opportunity to read and learn.  Books are essential to a student's intellectual and emotional development. If the power to ban books is granted, other forms of media like music, movies, and magazines will also be targeted. Books are for any reader who wishes to explore their worlds. Students have the right to choose their books and the ability to discern what they should read, so books should remain where they belong, in schools, readily accessible on the shelves, ensuring students' rights are upheld and their access to knowledge is protected."
540	3517	2	3	I think that libraries shouldn't display certain books because of racism, violence, and etc. One reason is because young children read books throughout the library. Also, books and magazines containing racism and such can be offensive to others. How would you feel about your children reading about things like that? That's something a child doesn't need to know at an early age, and libraries should consider the potential harm such materials could cause. Therefore, carefully curating the collection to exclude explicitly harmful content is a valid concern.
541	3518	2	3	There are many materials in libraries that are offensive to certain people. I don't think they should be taken off the shelves but I do believe they should be put into a different section in the library. Almost everything in life offends someone in one way or another. It might be as little as 'blonde jokes' or as major as saying something about someone's sexuality. I know little kids wouldn't understand those types of things but parents can't keep their kids hidden away forever.  If someone says something about someone else, then I do believe it's wrong. I mean think about how many 'blonde jokes' there are. A lot of blondes I know, don't take those jokes seriously. One of my good friends is a natural blonde and she is probably the smartest blonde I have ever met. Whenever she hears a blonde joke she laughs and says something funny to go with it.  Probably one of the most major things that people get offended by is politics or someone's sexuality. Politics create huge problems for people who don't think something should be one way and then if the governor turns around and says something and someone else will take it way too serious. Many people who are different because they don't like who they are 'supposed' to like are always offended by someone in some shape or form. It's not like parents can keep us away from it forever. Little kids become teenagers, teenagers become young adults who eventually become adults. People should learn how to deal with different struggles in life and the issues that arise around them.  So in conclusion, if a parent doesn't want to expose their child to things they think is offensive then good for them but other people like to learn about the things that people find offensive and that create problems in the community. I believe that by leaving the books, movies and magazines on the shelves in a separate area of the library isn't a bad idea. Think about it, if you take books away from people who want to learn about the different things and want to know why people get offended, wouldn't they feel offended too because you took that away from them? Therefore, a separate section balances the needs of different library users.
542	3519	2	3	Some books are offensive to some people. But everyone has the right to read any book they want. I believe we shouldn't censor books that are found offensive in schools. If people find a book offensive from the beginning, find another book to read or talk to the teacher.  I have had my experience with books that are offensive to me. Everyone has a book they have read that does that to them. But that same book I have read might be interesting to other people. Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right? So don't take a book in a hurtful way. Books are meant to be read, and some authors direct the book to certain people.  I had people come up to me from our own school saying the books they read were a horrible experience, especially when all they talk about is suicide, and one of my best friends has trouble with that because of her dad. I told her to talk to her teacher, and he changed the book for her. That's all you have to do and not make anything big about it.  I also read the book, 'To Kill a Mockingbird', which is censored in some states because it's hurtful to some people. The story is about a white family trying to help an African-American man who was accused of rape when he never committed such a thing. That was not acceptable at the time, and with all the evidence in the world, they still couldn't help him. It's a great story about what Black people went through in earlier years. And to think they would censor a story about a white lawyer trying to help someone who isn't his own race is inspiring to me, not offensive.  He got harassed, and his children got harassed, but he still fought with all he had to save his defendant. I am a 14-year-old boy who, when he read this book knowing who had a heart and who didn't, made me cry my eyes out. It's sad to know this book is censored in some states when this is definitely one of the best books I have ever read and also the only one that got to me. It would be a great experience for anybody to read this book, so even if it is censored where you live, go buy it and read it anyway.  I feel the state assumes they are gonna offend people. They might not even test it anyways. They might just say it's gonna offend this kinda people, and that's it. How do they come up with it? Do they let everybody read it once? No, and they should just leave it; whoever doesn't read it doesn't have to, or they can talk with their teacher. It's not so hard to decide to censor something when it's only your opinion. That's why I would look into the opinion of others.  All in all, censorship shouldn't be allowed, as it ruins the opportunity for people to read books they might find good and interesting to them. Let the kids read, at least in high school when they are almost adults, so they can read whatever they want and form their own opinions.
543	3520	2	3	Censorship being as touchy a subject it is in my belief should be very rarely upheld, yes I believe there should be exceptions such as censoring materials in a childrens library or a childrens section of a bigger library, but to censor is to take ones freedom of speech, and expression away from them and is by my standards nothing more than unamerican. Censorship acceptions should definetley be held in certain circumstances such as on a children's television network or a school library. Growing up my parents have not set any regulations for me regarding censorship, ever since I can remember I have been able to watch, read, and listen to anything I have ever wanted so my opinion is obviously going to slide toward uncensorship right? Wrong, although I do believe that nothing should be censored from the general public except for in special cases, I believe that it is the parents choice and full responsibility regarding their childrens censorship needs. I myself when I am a parent are going to censor my children away from what I seem unfit for their age whatever it may be.  The main reason that I am writing is to explain the moral issue that censorship is offering, yes the reason we consor is because we believe that the material is offensive or has ill moral, but these are the opinions and beliefs of the creators and being in a society that claims to be tolerant of one's beliefs we should respect the creator's beliefs even though it is not the belief of ourselves. To censor is to force an artist or in essence a creator to change they're very reflections of themselves, after all that is what a work of art is whether it be a painting, a musical piece, or a television show it shows a distinct look into the creators mind and beliefs to censor is to cut off or warp this communication between the audience and the creator thus violating the freedom of speech, and freedom of expression that our country holds so dear.  I call this a touchy subject because when there is childrens welfare involved it is always a touchy subject, to prevent children from being exposed to what their parents seem inapropriate I believe that we should retain a censorship in such places as childrens library or childrens television networks, but as a country we are putting too much responsibility and reliability on the hope that the government will censor what we seem unfit when in reality it should be the job and choice of the parents to censor what their children are exposed to, shifting this responsibility to families where it belongs. To solve this growing debate I believe the solution lies in the question, 'should we censor material' well yes and no I generally think that for every book, song, or creation that some seem unfit for society should be released as censored and uncensored, this would open up oppurtunities for children to read more advanced literature, will not take away from the personel expression of the creators, and will not deny the public what they are looking for because a censored material is a loss for the creator as well as the audience who enjoy it, ultimately allowing freedom of expression while respecting parental guidance.
544	3521	2	3	If materials are offensive they should not be displayed. Offensive materials can have big effects on children younger than at least ten years of age. I believe that if materials at a library are found offensive and proved to be offensive, then they should be removed. Materials at libraries are not for everyone. A lot of it is especially not for young children. For example: a young child could be wanting to check-out a movie that looks interesting to him/her. The movie could be rated PG-13 but the parents still check it out for them. Once they watch the movie, it might have some heavy language, sex-related humor or content. Then the child is learning and seeing all of this happening in a motion picture. Also if they have nervous parents, the library could get some calls. Today, a lot of younger children about 7+ have seen, watched, or read something that had profanity in it or inappropriate conduct in it. People have read some of the material that the library has and spotted some profanity not knowing it was in there. If a religious man/woman checked out a book or a magazine from the library and spotted the profanity they put in a lot of these books and magazines, it would absolutely bother them. If they won't take them off of the shelves, the least they can do is keep a list of all of the materials that have heavy profanity, sex, and strong violence in them. They should do that so they can warn the person who is checking out the material. With all of the nasty things that are seen in books, movies, magazines, etc., people need to be alerted to what they read and watch. Some of the books can get pretty nasty and terrible with all of the things they say. Library materials must be checked; If they are found offensive, and proved offensive, they should be moved, ensuring that the community is protected from potentially harmful content.
545	3522	2	3	People have different opinions; what one person may find extremely offensive another may not care or even laugh at it. In this next paragraph I will explain the reasons why censorship should not be allowed in libraries. One of the first things is our freedom of speech. If we really have that freedom, censorship violates it completely. Some things people say are offensive, but you must remember they are entitled to their opinion. They have a right to speak for what they believe in, whether it be magazines, books, newspapers, movies, or music. The author or artist may use those to spread his/her ideas and beliefs. Another reason is people's opinions. Does one person really speak for an entire gender, country, culture, race, religion? Whether he/she is the lowest of the low or a person of great power, someone may believe differently and miss out on something maybe they would have been inspired by or learned from. It is not right to deprive communication through these things. A man may find a book offensive to him or his family, but another man just like him may find the book funny and joke about it. People think differently from each other. Personal experiences also have a place. Maybe a near-death experience causes someone to write a book. Maybe a bad break-up causes someone to make a song. These help inspire people. No person can tell them it's wrong just because they think it's offensive or wrong. All these things factor in. No one person or group of people has a right to take away our freedom. I am against censorship in libraries, and I hope you are too, because limiting access to information hinders personal growth and societal progress.
546	3523	2	3	Does it ever come to mind when your child says they're going to the library to study, but in reality they could be going there to find books about murder, violence, or possibly helpful information. Today, when searching through the library you never know what TEENS will find on the shelves. Most of the topics of books, music, movies, or magazines are helpful. But there's always that one BOOK that you don't want your child finding, or that one movie you just hope your child isn't watching! I strongly believe that the the types of topics like violence and murder should be taken off of the library shelves. When going to the library parents should be able to trust that their child is actually going there to study, not to look up bad books, movies, or magazines. Too many books and movies are showing that relying on violence is a good thing. For example when children are searching for a good book they aren't looking for something boring, they're looking for something that catches their eye. Most of these books resulting to violence. The more kids read about this, the more they think violence is okay. Also magazines like 'TEEN BOOK' or 'TEENS BOOK' are now showing stories of drugs use, teen pregnancy, or death of famous TEENS. Today our world has been increasing in the drug use of teens and adults, also the pregnancy rate of teens has went up dramatically in the past few years. These two things are not okay. I personally believe the reason these two topics have went up is because kids are thinking it's fine since they're reading about it in the new magazines, or seeing it on a tv, or reading about it in a book. Kids or teens are believing it's easy to have a child at such a young age, or using drugs is cool because all the hot famous TEENS are using them, which is shown in the magazines and books. But what kids aren't understanding is that it's really not as easy or fun as the movies, books and magazines are making it sound. What happened to the library's that had information that was actually helpful in school? I understand that TEENS are wanting to read about famous TEENS and what's new with them. But when all of these types of books, magazines, and movies are put into our libraries it is limiting the amount of actual helpful information kids need for school or adults are needing for work. When I was younger, I would go to the library and I either went thier to study or to check out a good book. Not a book about violence, murder, or teen precnancy. Kids need to be able to rely on the libraries for a good book or information that will help them in school, not on topics that don't relate to school at all. As author, Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf'. I believe she is correct, these types of books, magazines, and movies that we don't want our kids finding need to be removed from the shelves of our libraries today, ensuring a safe and productive environment for learning and growth.
547	3524	2	3	Who is to label a book offensive? What one might find appauling, others may find a novel or passage to be rather interesting. All books and other arts were created to be read and enjoyed by people. Libraries banning books, music, movies, or magazines seems unreasonable since there is such a wide variety of people and their interests. Books such as The Bible, The Catcher's Rye, and Uncle Tom's Cabin have been removed from many library shelves. Though people may check these books out, many others find them either offensive or think they should not mix with every day books. I have read a decent amount of each of the above readings, and have found the books to be full of remarkable things which have taught me a lot. If books are banned from libraries, it almost seems as if they're limiting our education. Why would a book be published, or written for that matter, if we were not intended to read it? Any book could be offensive to any one person. Any article, song, or film could be offensive. But, there will always be a crowd it appeals to. And that crowd deserves to enjoy every last word. Censorship in libraries has gone on too long, it is time for the world to freely take part in the literature that interests them. The solution to library censorship is the division of books into categories and sub-categories. First by subject, down to the author. Therefore, books that may be offensive are listed as such, but are still available to those who want to read them. Censorship in libraries takes away from individual freedom every day. People should be able to read what they enjoy and not be ridiculed for it. All books are written to be read, and with the division of such books, everyone can agree upon this: books help us grow. Growth is not meant to be limited, nor is freedom, and libraries should reflect this core tenet.
548	3525	2	3	People have a choice on the types of literature they want to read wether it offends them or not the chose to read it. Books should not be removed from the shelves of libraries. They need to try to avoid the books that might be offensive to them. Now if they cant then thats not the libraries fault. Books should not be removed for many reasons. One of the many reasons books should not be removed is because they know the risk they take when entering a library, and that's their decision that they are making and sometimes decisions have consequences. When and if they are offended, they will know the types of books that offened them so they would just have to do a little better job of avoiding those books. Another reason would be the libraries dont know what offends people it can be one little thing in a book but that doesn't mean that book should be removed from the shelfs. Also just cause one person thinks its offensive doesn't mean that others will. People aren't all offended by the same thing some people are offended by little things, meaning they're offended easily, some aren't offended so easy, that means it make take more serious things than a book to offend a person. Another reason books shouldn't be removed is because students need them for projects and school assignments. Some school assignments require you getting a little offended exspecially if your african american and you get an assignment on slavery or something during that time. But we need to learn about past experiences and our history and we couldnt do that if some people are trying to remove some of those books from the shelf. You might get offended but there is no reason to remove that book that others will need at sometime. Find another way to solve that problem. There are other ways to solve problems like these such as tagging the books with a yellow small sticker so it would warn people that the book offended someone. There is no need to completly remove the book. Another solution would be to maybe seperate the books, meaning put the books in a diffrent location of the library if the get more than a couple complaints of being offensive. Also when someone check out a book the librarian can warn them that the book has been tagged with a yellow sticker and its possible that it might offend them. Thats why removing books from shelves aren't called for because there are multiple solutions that do not involve complete removal.
549	3526	2	3	"I agree that certain books, music, and magazines can be very offensive and that, as parents, we want to protect our children from harmful influences. I understand the desire to remove these ""bad things"" to help children become better people. It's true that negative influences in media can contribute to problems like drug use, especially when popular figures seem to endorse them. We all want our children to have the opportunity to succeed, and exposure to drugs and violence makes that harder. The images in magazines can also create unrealistic and harmful expectations, particularly for young girls.  However, completely banning these things might not be the most effective approach. While we should shield younger children, older children need to learn to think critically and make their own choices. Trying to shield them entirely might backfire, making these things more appealing. It's important to teach them about the dangers of drugs, violence, and unrealistic beauty standards, and to encourage them to develop their own values. We can guide them towards positive influences and help them understand the difference between reality and the often-distorted portrayals in media, so banning these things may not be the most effective way to ensure our children's success and well-being."
550	3527	2	3	There are plenty of books that people don't want their children reading. Books such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1' is a book I had read and it was very out there and straight forward. But I would have to disagree I think those books deserve to be read. It shows kids that not everything is perfect. People complain about how they think books are bad or things people say on @CAPS3 or in music is bad but if you don't want to listen to them, don't let your kids listen to it. If parents are so worried about what kids are reading or learning because of the world we live in now, lock them up. But I do have to agree with one thing, there are alot of bad things in muic and magazines but I think it can be avoided and not be caused to crupt a kid. I'm very into music and some music I dont listen to because of the things in it but I dont let that music or magazines change my option on things. I dont think people should be able to take books of the shelfs becaue it doesnt give other students or people to read them. Some people get inspired by books about drugs, not like to use them but to know that there are people out there that have overcome stitutions just like them. I like reading books about teenage problems and like to know all the different ways people have overcome them and see how they live. If people can get offended off of a book or movie I don't think they have a right to take that away. I think people that feel offended by books, magazines, and movies should stay away from them if they are offensive to them, because everyone has an option and not everyone thinks the same things. With all the bad or good movies or books out there, I'm certain someone at least feels offended by one or two books or movies but that isn't a reason to want to take it down. Because once you do that someone will take a book you thought wasn't offensive and it will make you mad. I think if people stayed away from things that offended them and stayed close to books that they liked we wouldn't have much of a conflict unless you get that picky, always wanting to start a fight person to find something else to be picky about with the books or magazines or movies. This is why censorship is ultimately detrimental to society, and individual choice should always be respected.
551	3528	2	3	Do you think having inappropriate or offensive books, magazines, movies or music should be found in a public library? Some books could be very offensive to people and when they take their children or younger siblings to the library, they don't want them looking at that. Others prefer looking at it which would anger them if they were taken away. Not all parents find some of the things in libraries offensive, even if they might be. Having music, magazines, movies or books that aren't appropriate for children should just be put into a different section, not taken away from those who enjoy it. Even though having children look at something they shouldn't could be bad, it's also bad and unfair to those who only come to the library to view those things. It shouldn't be taken away from them. If parents don't want their children seeing those things, the shouldn't take them to that section. Some adults don't enjoy seeing it, which can be understandable. No matter what, someone wouldn't be very happy about the decision.  In libraries, there is usually an adult section and kids section. If an adult doesn't want their child seeing something, they could simply take them to children's section where it won't be seen. In the children's section it's hard to find things that would be considered 'offensive' to adults. For the adults or teenagers who enjoy viewing these things, they could be in a section far away from the children. Taking things that people like away from someone is wrong and it would be mean to take that away from those who enjoy it.  Recently, the world has been turning into something it shouldn't. Some of the most disgusting and cruel things happen every day and you could probably find this news in a library. It's understandable if you wouldn't want your child around that, but I it's wrong to take away those things from the people that love that stuff. For example, scary movies could be very disturbing and too violent for a young child but they could be an adults favorite thing to watch. Thats why, if you put the more offensive things in a different section, the kids wouldn't notice it was even there.  If children were put into a different section, they wouldn't even notice the offensive things adults find. Taking away the things some adults might find offensive is like taking away the children's section, unfair. It wouldn't be fair to take away something that some adults or teenagers only come to the library for. Not all adults would understand both sides but I can see where both sides are coming from. If I had children I wouldn't want them seeing things that are offensive, but I would keep them away from it instead of promoting against it. Having music, magazines movies or books that aren't appropriate for children should just be put into a different section, not taken away from those who enjoy it, because that would be the most reasonable and fair compromise for everyone involved.
552	3529	2	3	There are millions of books and other media in libraries all across the world. Millions of people read and listen to those materials every day. Some people @MONTH1 like certain books or media and dislike others. Many people dislike certain materials because of their content. Everyone has the right to read and watch what they want and not everyone will read or watch the same materials. Although some materials @MONTH1 be offensive, they should not be removed from the libraries. Books and other media should not be removed from library shelves because what some people find offensive does not offend other people. Everyone has a right to their own beliefs and opinions. If someone wants to read a book or watch a video, they should be able to. What is offensive and what is not is a personal choice and it all depends on that person's point of view. If someone thinks the content in a book, song, or movie is offensive, then they should not read or listen to it. Materials should not be removed from libraries because they can be used to learn history and other things that people should know about. Take, for example, the @CAPS1. There are thousands of books on the @CAPS1 and many movies as well. These materials should not be removed from library shelves because even though some people find them offensive, they can be used to teach people how horrible it was so that it does not happen again. People should inform themselves about something before they view it so that they are not offended by the content inside. Some content in history is very mature and should only be viewed by mature audiences. The offensive content should not be removed from libraries because it is usually in a mature section and it has a right to be there. Most content that some people find offensive is for adult audiences. There are not children's books that talk about things that parents would find offensive to their children. The content has a right to be there. If the author or publisher took the the time to create the work, then they should recieve credit for making it. In the @LOCATION1, there is freedom of speech and people should be able to say what they want to say. If the content is too offensive then it should be removed but only under special circumstances. While there might be extreme cases, the vast majority of materials should remain available. The content in libraries, offensive or not, should not be removed. People can read or watch whatever they want. Many people have many different opinions on what should and should not be in libraries. The libraries are public and they are shared. No one person has the right to dictate what should and should not be in libraries. If it was not for libraries, the people in society would not be as smart as they are, and the diversity of thought and opinion that libraries foster is essential to a well-informed and free society.
553	3530	2	3	Have you ever wondered why a movie you rented from a library when you were younger, isn't there today? This is due to censorship. Libraries censor certain books if they believe them to be inappropriate for young children. Should censorship be allowed in libraries? Everyone has their own opinion, as do I, and I believe it should be allowed. Censoring books allows libraries to withhold books, movies, magazines, music, and more from children who are not quite mature enough to handle the contents within the material, rather it be curse words in a movie, book, or music, nudity shown in magazines, or fighting shown in a video game. Young children look for role models, someone to follow, therefore, more than likely they are going to repeat what they hear or see. Some children are not quite mature enough to understand that it's not alway 'okay' to repeat what you hear, some words are inapporopriate for young children. Maybe they saw that on a movie, a man or woman solved a problem he or she had by fighting, the young child will take the message the wrong way, and try and solve one of his or her problem by fighting. I believe that an age limit should be set for certain types of materials. Children that are under the age of 13 should not be watching movies that are rated PG-13. There is a reason the rating is what it is. Just because your child is not allowed to rent/check out whatever the material may be, doesn't mean that you couldn't check it out, maybe go home and watch/listen/read/play it. If it doesn't seem to violent/graphic for your child then allow them to watch the movie, read the book, or play the game. That is your choice, but a library doesn't want to be blamed for your 6 year old coming home cursing and fighting. My sister took my neice to the library once to rent a movie, it was a childrens movie, and my sister thought nothing harmful would come about it, but in one of the scenes, there was some arguing and fighting, and my neice began arguing with my sister, and hitting her, and my sister wasn't very pleased that they allowed that movie to be on the childrens floor of the library. Censorship is a wonderful thing to have in libraries. Maturity level for some children is just not quite high enough for them to see/watch/listen/play certain materials, especially without parental guidance. Not only should censorship be allowed, it should be enforced. I believe all libraries should have to have censorship in their library. Therefore, a structured and thoughtful approach to censorship within libraries can help protect children while still providing access to information under the guidance of parents or guardians.
554	3531	2	3	"One day in May, I walk into a library, look over at a magazine rack and think, ""Cosmopolitan is that in the young adult section, the content of that book is not age appropriate?"" In many libraries, some books are not censored and catagorized the way they should. In some of the reading material, one might not even realize that some inappropriate things are in it. Supervision of children and young adults are not always looked upon, and some of these people might not even know what they are checking out. Censorship needs to be pushed more in libraries. In most libraries, the catagories for books are children, young adult, adult books by genere, magazines, and music, but what needs looked upon is what is on the inside covers of those books. Some magazine articles are not appropriate for some teens, even if it does claim to be age appropriate. I remember when I was fourteen, I read a series that was related to colors off the color weel. Each one covered a different topic such as suicide, alcholism, drugs, sex, same sex dating, and jealousy. Looking back on it, I am surprised I was allowed to check them out at the library. A fourteen year old didn't need to read books on such heavy topics. Also, language in books and music maybe unappropriate for children, and may be distasteful and disrespectful for some adults. The catagories need to be catogorized even more, so people further know what they are getting into when checking out a book or magazine. When a child goes up to check out a book they found, a librarian sometimes doesn't even pay attention to the book they are getting, they simply check it out. Libraries should have a rating system like movies do. Generally people would not let their ten-year-old go to a movie rated R, PG-13 or that is unrated, so why would they let their child get a book holding the same content? If books had a rating system, that ten-year- old would not get their hands on a book rated 'PG-13' or 'Mature' for mature. In libraries there is not as much supervision as their needs to be. I am aware that libraries are not day-care center and the librarians are not babysitters, but there also needs to be stricter guidelines, because some people are not fully aware of what their children or what they, themselves, are reading. For example, a thirteen-year-old girl wants to check out Seventeen magazine, because her best friend's older sister gets it. The girl's mother allows it because it probably won't be too bad and she assumes her daughter wants to look at the pictures of new clothes and trends. What the mother may not realize is in the middle of the magazine contains an article about sex and protection, and that may open a whole new world for the little girl. Even though the mother shouldn't have had let her daughter check out the magazine, if the guidelines were stricter at the library the girl might have never have read that article. Even if librarians had to check or scan a person's library card to make sure they can be in the section or be reading a certain book, it would be protecting many more people then it would be hurting. If libraries censored books better, then children and teens may not be reading things not age appropriate to them. I'm not saying that books should be removed off the shelf, just maybe put up higher, and be watched over more carefully, so that readers are shielded from potentially harmful content until they are ready to engage with it thoughtfully."
555	3532	2	3	I think that overall, anything taken as offensive to anybody should be taken out of libraries. I think that if they are very offensive, then they should be taken out; but if they are just mildly offensive, then I think they should stay. Because the library welcomes people of all ages, materials that can be taken offensive for children are most of the time not taken as offensive to adults. But since children go in there and can have access to anything in there, they can end up finding something that can be offensive. If a child finds something that their parents can be taken as offensive, then the library could possibly get sued and that would not be good. So if they just take any books, music, magazines, or movies that are not suitable for people of all ages, they can cut the risk of being sued. Libraries are meant to provide information anyways. They have no need for things that are offensive, because rarely something that is offensive, provides information. Libraries should just contain what they were made for: encyclopedias, dictionaries, books, and other books that can provide useful information to people. In conclusion I would say that materials that can be offensive to anyone of any age, should be taken out of libraries, as protecting children is paramount and lawsuits should be avoided. Libraries are meant to provide information to people so I think that's all that they should have available for circulation.
556	3533	2	3	Should books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive to public be removed? No, I strongly disagree. Should books that might be offensive to others? No, because there are hundreds and thousands of different books and even more readers. All books have different themes and subjects and all readers have different opinions on them. For example, say there is a book about abortions and you want to know more about this subject, so you decide to check it out. In the line behind you is a woman who tells you not to purchase this book because she disagrees with killing a baby and tells the owner to cancel this book for that reason. No, this would not happen; just because someone hates or dislikes something, it could very well be something someone loves and enjoys. Here are some reasons why you would agree to removing some things off the shelves, like sex. Things such as sex may offend people because you may believe it promotes sex to young teenagers or young kids, but that's not the case. Most books on sex teach you the right and wrong things to do and how to stay safe. People need to understand that a large percentage of teens worldwide are sexually active, and books that might help you to protect yourself and others. In conclusion, there are many people that may or may not like the books or other things that they find offensive, but everyone has their opinion. You can't take things away just because of one person; that would not be fair to an individual with a problem that is seeking help or information on their personal problem. For these reasons, I disagree with taking away items that may be offensive to others because everyone is different in this world, and that should not change because of a disagreement or opinion someone has.
557	3534	2	3	No, I don't think that books or any other material should be taken off shelves in libraries just because some people might find them offensive. I think that if a parent sees something that they do not want their child reading, then it is in their right to not allow that child read it, but it is unfair to take it off the shelf entirely. That book that has been marked 'offensive' could have been a way for another person to learn about that book and possibly gain something out of it. There are some non-fiction books out there that can marked as 'offensive', and they are just that non-fiction. It is something that really happen and anyone can learn something from it by reading it, and to take it away would be taking away the knowledge that another person could have obtained. I believe that in a library people should have a choice to read what they choose and not have it ripped off the shelf just because parents don't want their child reading it. I think that if they do not want their child to read it, then the parents can tell that child that they don't want them reading that and then everybody wins. I know that I have read some non-fiction books that would be marked by some people as offensive, but with that book I also learned much about the topic at hand. To take away that book would be showing that you care only about how it might be offensive to some people and not how it could help extend the knowledge of another. If we are to take away every book that might have a racial slur here or an act of violence there, what would we have left our children to read and to learn from. They read these books and they can find out how that racial slur or act of violence as hurt someone emotionaly and physicaly, and that they should never do it in fear of the concicence that they might have to face later on. The library's role is to provide access to a wide range of materials and perspectives, and censorship limits that access. Ultimately, parents have the right to guide their own children's reading choices, but they should not impose those choices on the entire community. Overall, I think that the books and other material in libraries should be kept on the shelves, and if someone finds it offensive or anything else they shouldn't read it and not deprive someone of that knowledge. We live in a world today where education is everything, and we think that everyone should have an education. But if we take away every book that a person does not like then what do we have left to learn from, hindering the very pursuit of knowledge that libraries are meant to support.
558	3535	2	3	Censorship in libraries is an important thing in schools and in the public. It is important because some movies, books, and magazines have a bigger influence on the kids than most people think. Like some of the really gory movies where there are always people getting cut up or shot. Do you really think that some kids don't think about that stuff? Sometimes the kids can get it in their head that they can do what they see or read. Like in the movie @LOCATION1 like Mississippi Burning @CAPS1 they are beating up and killing people just because they are colored. And some kids @MONTH1 might really think that that is ok. And they can go down to their library and just get it off the shelf and check it out and go home and watch it. Now if you are using it as a thing to teach kids that it was the way things used to be and that it is wrong, then that is ok. You can teach your kids all you want just make sure that it is the right thing. And some magazines that are in the schools or in the public libraries are just not the kind of thing that kids should be looking at. Like the gun magazines or the hunting magazines, they just show that it is ok to carry a gun wherever they go. And the hunting magazines just show that you can go out and shoot stuff. And some kids @MONTH1 will be confused that you need a license to do all of that. You have to at least put an age limit on some stuff. It goes the same way with some of the books; they always start out good, and then they just turn into a big mess of gore and violence. Like the Sphere; it started out with a group of people going underwater to explore a ship. And they find a big sphere, and they go in it and get these powers, and they imagine it, and it comes true. Well, when a kid reads that, they @MONTH1 might think that they can do that, and they start imagining that they can either hurt or really do some damage to someone. And then when they find out that it won't work, they @MONTH1 may do it to them themselves. So it just comes to show that you should censor some of the stuff that you have in your libraries, and if you can't take them out, then at least put an age limit on them, as that would provide a safer and more responsible environment for young library patrons.
559	3536	2	3	I don't think offensive materials should be removed from libraries. If a person is offended by something, they shouldn't get it. They should ignore it and find something else of interest. If someone complains about a book, music, movies, or anything, they shouldn't go to the library. I think if people get offended over a book or something and complain, they shouldn't be allowed in the library.  When I was in seventh grade, we took a field trip to the city library. I thought it was fun because it looked awesome inside. I was walking around searching for a book about animals because all the seventh graders had to research an animal. While looking, I saw a man yelling at a librarian. He was a person of color, complaining because he read a book about slaves. He was offended because his grandfather was a slave. I read the same book and thought there was nothing offensive about it because it told about the slaves having to do hard work, then eventually getting free. It was history.  My opinion is that offensive materials should not be removed from libraries. People who do not think they are offensive will read them. If a person thinks a book is offensive, they should walk away and find a different one. Therefore, offensive materials should not be removed from libraries; personal offense should dictate individual choices, not censorship for all.
560	3537	2	3	Censorship in Libraries Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' There are many books, magazines, and movies out there that contain content not necessarily appropriate for young children. Part of a parent's job is to ensure their children are safe and looking at materials appropriate for their age level. However, this does not mean taking materials off of library shelves for everyone. Censorship in libraries rids people of their freedom to choose. Also, content that is inappropriate for children may be fine for adults to read. It is the responsibility of the parent to censor what their child takes off the shelf.  All people of society have certain rights allowing them to express themselves and to be free. People have the freedom to choose, whether it is books, magazines, movies, or music. Everyone is different and this causes the interests of each person to be different, also. Libraries offer a variety of materials and this allows people to choose what they want based on their interests. Censoring the content on the shelves of libraries may be a good idea for children, however adults have the right to choose what they want to take from the shelf. Would you like to have a portion of your freedom taken away? Censorship would greatly lower the freedom of everyone and their individuality.  Furthermore, censoring what is on the shelves of libraries limits the range of materials that are available to patrons. There is content out there that children should not see; however adults have the right to choose what they want to read and come in contact with. Although certain materials are not meant for children to see, adults may find it enjoyable and interesting. Libraries offer a large range of materials and this allows people to express themselves and find entertainment. There are many different types of books and music out there and censoring these would greatly limit the variety.  In addition, parents have the responsibility to watch over their children. They choose what their child wears, where they live, and where they attend school. It is no different when it comes to books, movies, and music. Each parent has a different style of parenting and they choose what works best for their child. If one parent finds something to be offensive or inappropriate, they shelter their children from it. However, another parent may not have a problem with it. The content children choose from library shelves should be at the discretion of the parent. Afterall, you cannot shelter children from everything.  Censorship in libraries results in more problems than solutions. It rids patrons of their right to choose and their freedom. Censoring materials also greatly limits the variety of content available for people to choose from. It is not the responsibility of the law to choose what children can and cannot read, but rather the parent's job to watch over what they take off the shelf. As citizens of the United States, we have rights and freedom allowing us to act as indivuals. Censoring the materials on library shelves results in very little materials left. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books life on the shelf for any of us.'
561	3538	2	3	Censorship, is it needed in today's society? Where things that were considered bad even years ago are okay today to be viewed, read, listened to, and so on. Is it a needed process, or should libraries have free will to stock their shelves with whatever they seem fit to be there? Is it still a good process to use, or is it an outdated, unneeded resource that is now no longer needed?  Everybody in today's society says to read, but libraries not have the type of literature that you are into, so why would you want to read something that you do not like because the library does not have the book that you wanted to see?  I believe that censorship in libraries should be there to remove any book they find offensive or immoral from their library. I do not believe they should remove books because of bad language or something about God.  I think that books or magazines or movies with content should be removed from libraries if they see it fit. Libraries should only feature books that they want to have, not ones that are popular but considered 'bad' by the library. They should only have books they want to have.  I do believe that there should be censorship in libraries. I just do not believe that it should be a harsh system. I think that they should set standards on what they want to have and follow those standards on books they buy.  I do think, however, that some libraries will set their standards too low or high, that they will either have many books that are considered 'bad' or no books at all. It is a very fine line when it comes to materials that the library has to be considered good or bad. I think libraries should have a set of standards nationwide to set what type of material is good for libraries.  I believe that censorship is still a needed and helpful process. I just think that it is too much of an opinionated process, not enough facts or opinions of the people. I think that it should remain in use for society; I just believe it should be more under control than it is today, with clearer, more consistent guidelines ensuring that libraries remain valuable resources for the entire community.
562	3539	2	3	Author Katherine Paterson proclaims, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work i abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' A controversial issue in today's society are people's conflicting views on censorship in libraries. Many types of books, magazines, music, movies, and much more have been banned from being put on the shelves of libraries because of their content. From personal experience, observations, and reading of the issue censorship should not be allowed in libraries. The shelves of libraries will soon be empty if censorship continues. Certain readings, and types of entertainment have already begun to disappear one by one. It is understandable if one person does not agree with the material being placed into these books, but why should they ruin the entertainment for everyone else? From my own experience, people in my elementary school were not able to enjoy reading a popular series of books at that time period. Since I went to a parochial school, the priest at the corresponding church during that time decided he did not agree with the content in this certain series of books. As a result, he took charge and made the staff of the school remove those books from our school library, and no student was allowed to come to school with one of those types of books. If it had been up to him, he would have decided to go ahead and take out all those books from everywhere in the world. Just because one individual does not agree on the content of that book, they should not be able to have the power to banish the lovely leisure for the rest of the population. Authors and artists of books, movies, and music have the freedom to put into them whatever they choose. It should not be up to their audience to decide whether or not it is appropriate. The concept is quite simple; if the reader or viewer does not think they would agree with the work, then they should not spend their time to read or view the pieces at hand. Just because they might not completely think what the content entails is necessarily appropriate, someone else might enjoy it. Censorship is wrong for this very reason. The creators of their work are most likely proud of what they have accomplished and would like their audience to enjoy it to. The audience they are trying to appeal to may not have the same taste in style as someone who the work was not necessarily meant to have their own opinion on the matter. Books should not be able to be taken out of libraries because what one person might think is not appropriate to be placed into public, another person may enjoy thouroughly. Likewise, if the content of a work of literature does not appeal to an individual then it should just simply not be read by that person. As humans, there is the freedom of choice as to what people would like to read, and what they would not like to indulge in. So make the correct choice in deciding what you want to read, and do not ruin the enjoyment for many others. In a great deal of different types of literature censorship is touched on by the authors. For example, in the popular prize-winning novel, Fahrenheit 451, books are burned, or 'censored' because they contain information people should not be aware of in that period of time. However, in today's world books are a major type of entertainment and are important in the knowledge of everyone. Books provide so much information on almost every subject known to human-kind that it would be such a dramatic loss if now books were burned if caught reading one. Paterson does point out that everyone has a right to their own opinion of this matter, but if people do not take the right approach to solving this situation, there will be no books left on library shelves for several generations after to enjoy for themselves. Every individual has their own right to be able to read books and absorb all the wonders and knowledge they contain. As a result of the growing awareness of censorship in today's libraries, people may never be able to enjoy certain types of books, movies, music, and magazines. From my own past experiences on this situation I know how wrong it is to take away someone's own privelage to enjoy types of literature. People should not have a say whether something is appropriate or not to be taken out of libraries. If the individual does not simply agree with the specific content of the work then they need to accept it and move on instead of causing millions of others to not enjoy it. Also, from different types of reading, censorship has definitely become a serious issue, but it should be abolished, allowing everyone the freedom to explore diverse ideas and perspectives. Keep the books that are on library shelves now for many generations to come and enjoy for themselves.
563	3540	2	3	Censorship is a law and it is commonly broken. You cannot censor any books, movies, music, or magazines. The law of censorship is usually broken in libraries. I feel that censorship affects the writers and school system. In the US people have the right to express their beliefs and feelings on any type of topic that is brought up. Many libraries are taking away the right of that by not allowing certain books to not be read in classes or not allowing the students to watch certain types of movies. I think that this would offend the person whom wrote the book or the writter of the script for a movie. If they librarian doesn't want a certain type of book in her library then she shouldn't have that job or she shouldn't have books at all. Just because she doesn't like the genre of books doesn't mean that somebody else who comes in won't want to read it. If a teacher doesn't want her class to see a movie because it's something that she doesn't like then she shouldn't even show movies at all in her class.  In school we aren't allowed to read about certain topics in the library, because the school system feels that it is bad for us to know about. If we want to learn about something we should be able to. Maybe we don't want to learn about something the teacher is teaching us about. Do we take away everything the teacher used to learn about that topic? Do we take the teacher out of the classroom? No. We show respect and we read what they want us to read about and we listen to what they have to say about the topic. It's respect, we learnt that in kindergarden. I think that they should show us respect to and let us read and watch movies about the genres of books and movies they take away from us.  Censorship is illegal where we live. But why isn't it taken seriously by the government? I think that they need to realize that what they are allowing is discrimonation to the writer. We get in trouble if we virbally discrimonate somebody. So why are they not doing anything about the physical discrimonation? We should be able to have higher knowledge on a topic we feel the need to learn about. I think this law should actually be enforced instead of ignored. It isn't fair to us or the writter, and by enforcing anti-censorship laws, we protect the rights of both creators and those seeking knowledge.
564	3541	2	3	Do you think that books that have vulgar things in them should be on libraries shelves? We all know that there are books out there are parents hope we never get a hold of. In this time try and find a good action movie without cuss words in it. It is nearly impossible to do that. Just because books have vulgar language, blood and gore, and sexual things, doesn't mean they should be pulled off the shelf. Have you seen the banned book list lately? I have and some of those books on there are ridiculous. Here are a few *To Kill a Mockingbird*, *The Hate U Give*, *THE COLOR PURPLE*, *OF MICE AND MEN*, and *THE ABSOLUTELY TRUE DIARY OF A PART-TIME INDIAN*, *To Kill a Mockingbird's* *content*. I could go on and on, the list is a mile long. Some of these books have historical meanings behind them. There is also morals behind them. I think that books should not be pulled from the self because they have a few bad words in them. It's not like we have never heard them words. In *THE ABSOLUTELY TRUE DIARY OF A PART-TIME INDIAN*, *To Kill a Mockingbird's* *content* they have banned it from schools because of the use of the word 'nigger'. This is not a nice word in our day and time. Back when we had slaves that is what they were called. It is points and views from an anti-slavery author. In *ANIMAL FARM* *AND TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE* it is banned because of animals talking. Come on really they have animals in movies that talk all the time. I believe that if kids don't no that animals cant really talk we might have problems. Do you find the show *Family Guy* the *cartoon* offensive? Well it has been banned because *some episodes* is racist against *other races*. I would like to no how some of these people come up with this at. Whoever picks up this offensive material has a choice whether or not they read it. It should be on the shelf even if it is offensive. I believe that it is totally up to you, if you read it. Just like if you go to a movie store they have the movies rated. You dont want to watch rated *R* movies then dont rent it. They could use the same method with books. Do you still think offensive books should be pulled from shelfs? If you say yes, I would like to no why. It is your choice to read it. There are already all these other banned books out there why ban any more. Just because books have vulgar language, blood and gore, and sexual things, doesn't mean they should be pulled from shelfs. Ultimately, restricting access to books based on subjective interpretations of offensiveness is a disservice to intellectual freedom and individual choice; leaving these works on the shelves empowers readers to engage with diverse perspectives and make informed decisions for themselves.
565	3542	2	3	I think censorship in libraries is wrong. Books, movies, and magazines are meant to enlighten, inform, and entertain the readers. If you find something offensive in a book, movie, or even a magazine, that doesn't mean the next person will. If you don't want your child reading or watching those things, then limit what they watch or read; don't make the people who don't have a problem with what they're reading or watching suffer. They have the same right to have those books, movies, and magazines on the shelves as you do! There have been times when I've wanted a book, but the library won't get it because of the adult content in the book. Yet, I was raised reading those books, so to me it wasn't adult content. The same goes with the movies; I was allowed to watch rated R movies when I was eight years old. Yet movies have ratings that tell you if it's for a child or adult, like G to rated R. The library has the same works, a child cannot rent a movie rated R without a parent present to get it for them, same goes for a movie theater. Parents who are worried about their children's well-being, shouldn't make libraries take books, movies, and magazines off the shelves because of things they find offensive. Other people who pay taxes for those books, movies, and magazines would like to read them as much as the next one, like some libraries ban 'The Color of Purple', because of the way the story is written. Someone found it offensive and gathered a lot of other people, whom didn't read the book but took the word from the person who did, and banned the book. If they had read the book they'd would have understood, it wasn't meant to be offensive, but a fictional story of color. I remember living in a town with a lot of Christian people, so the libraries only had Christian books. When I went to the librarian and asked for a series of books and was always turned down, because of the Christian population. I told them 'I have as much rights to have those books on the shelves, as they have to have their books on the shelves.' I never got those books, but maybe someday they will look back on those requests and think of why they should have gotten them. The reason I think censorship is wrong is because no one should be able to tell people what they should read or watch when they pay the same taxes everyone does to have those books and movies on the libraries shelves. If you have a problem with what your child watches and reads, then limit what your child reads and watches. Don't take away other people's rights to read and watch what they want, as libraries should be places of diverse thought and accessible information for everyone.
566	3543	2	3	In Katherine Paterson's writing she tells us that she does not want her child to pick up a book off the shelf that could be found offensive. But I think that there should be sections of the library that are cut off away from the public eye, but are still there for those certain people. If my child were to pick up a book that was not for his or her age group I would not get mad, because I know that some of the book groups are close to others than some, but they are for everyone to see, which could be offensive to some. I would tell my son or daughter that that book is not for you, and we would go and pick out a new book to read. Over all I think that there should be sections of the library that are made for a certain age group, and should not be seen by kids. Because once I was that little kid, and went wondering through the miles of shelfs to find a really wonderful book to read, but long behold that didn't happen, I had wondered along to find a book that was not in my age group. This is especially true now, given the increased availability of various types of literature. So I think that there needs to be more careful eyes in the library staff to make sure that those kind of things will never happen again, and that age-appropriate sections are properly monitored and maintained.
567	3544	2	3	There are some movies, books, music, etc. that may be found offensive toward some people. I feel that if you are at the appropriate age for a type of literature you should be able to observe it. If you read a book and you find it offensive, then you shouldn't have read the book. Books, music, and movies are made to entertain you; however, if you are not entertained then what you're reading or watching is not for you! I have had an experience in which I was offended by a movie I watched. It degraded women in which they were beaten and were treated as slaves. I was offended because as I watched the movie, I realized that these women were someone's daughter and mother. I wouldn't agree with my mother being treated that way, also I wouldn't want any other woman being treated that way either. After I watched the movie, I went and informed my mother on how that movie offended me. I am sure that the authors who write the books' intentions aren't to offend the reader; however, there may be a way that they can restate things that they say. I know that people have their own opinion, and that people think differently. If it is obvious that the author's intentions are to offend the reader then you shouldn't purchase a book like that. If you find a book on the shelf, and you find it offensive, it shouldn't have to be removed from the shelf. Another person may read the book, and they might like it. Everyone has their own way of thinking, and how they absorb information. It may be offensive to the reader, but someone else may receive the book and admire it. In conclusion, I feel that if you are offended by a certain book, type of music, or movie you should learn from the movie, and explain why it offended you. If a parent is offended they shouldn't allow their children to observe it as well, as it will have a negative effect on your child. Books, music, movies, etc. are made to entertain, not to offend, so understanding your own boundaries is important.
568	3545	2	3	I believe that censorship is a very debatable subject for many. But I think that I have a pretty good outlook, and a pretty good view on this. In this essay I'm going to give you my reasoning, and explain, and give some reasons why I think censorship is a good thing, and should maybe be enforced heavier. Censorship. Should books, music, movies, magazines, etc. be taken off the shelf? I believe that it is NOT okay, and everyone should have their right to read what they want to, and what they don't. I believe, that if someone wants to read something vulgar, then let them. If they are an adult, it's their choice. I think as far as the child part of it, that no, children should not be allowed to read things that might be vulgar, sexual, etc. In keeping children away from these vulgar things, they should have, or keep separate sections for kids and adults. I don't think that children should be able to have the access, and maybe they won't know about it, or want it. If their parents think it's okay, and want to let them read it, or watch it, or listen to it, that before they become an adult they will have to get it for them. I don't believe that children should be candy-coated and blind to the world, I just believe that there is a certain extent to what they need to be limited to.  I obviously think that censorship is a good thing. I think if there was more of it, I think there would be less crime. Kids are learning this, they're watching as young as god knows what, thinking it's okay from the start, and are growing up with that picture and message, of them thinking it's okay. No I am not saying that all kids learn everything from t.v., etc., and yes some might argue that kids don't copy what's on t.v. at all. But I think that t.v., books, and music affect a lot of how children view the world. As much as I love rap music, and movies such as A.T.L, rappers such as Lil Wayne, even sometimes when I watch, or listen to those things, it kind of makes me feel like being jaded, and kind of makes me feel like I want to have a bad attitude towards the world, it makes me feel like I wanna live that hard life like that. I think that music, books, what we watch on t.v., and what we read in the magazines, have a big affect. Such as if we watch the news and there's something depressing, it kind of makes you in a bad mood, or sad or depressed.  The media, music, t.v., books, magazines, etc., affect our mood, our actions, and even sometimes the way we talk, and dress. I am not saying that dressing that more urban feel is a bad thing, I am just saying when you start doing crime, and drugs because of it, it's a problem. I believe that children should only be censored and not adults, because at the point when you reach adulthood, you're pretty much set in your ways, and have a pretty good lookout on what you should be doing, and how you want things done. Children are still maturing, and are like a sponge. Censorship, is a very sensitive, and argumentable/debatable issue, but this is just my view, what's yours? Ultimately, while censorship is a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides, I believe that strategically implemented censorship, particularly concerning children's access to certain content, could have a positive impact on society.
569	3546	2	3	To whom it may concern; As a student, I find myself reading frequently: at home, at school, in the library, in the car, basically any place I can get my hands on a novel. However, the novels that I have read are not always novels I have chosen for my personal gain. I must admit, I am not an avid reader on my own. I am the kind of student that enjoys reading a book that interests me. Many of the books I choose are relatable to reality, which often involves content that may be considered explicit. I believe books, magazines, movies, music, etc. should not be taken off shelves.  As American citizens, we have the right to free speech. This allows us the freedom to speak our mind and express our thoughts without restricting our personalities. This law allows authors and producers the right to base their work on what they want. Media that may be considered explicit is appealing to a variety of people, and to some it is considered disturbing. With the freedom we have as Americans, we have the choice to see said movies, or read said books, but we also have the choice to avoid those situations. When producers produce movies containing sexual content, language, or violence, they aren't producing the movie, expecting every citizen to see it. They know some citizens are against that content. There is no law forcing us to see movies that we do not desire to see. We have the ability to choose what we want and do not want.  Explicit material is available everywhere you look. Walking in Walmart and Target, we see books, music, and magazines lining the walls, most containing explicit material. Though many novels contain explicit material, there are still numerous amounts that do not. People complain about explicit content in novels when in actuality, there are many novels without explicit content. We are trained as humans to look for the bad in situations. We lead pessimistic lifestyles. Citizens need to learn to realize not everything is terrible. Look for the good in situations. There is an abundance of media that contains no explicit content or sexual material and we are given warnings as to what contains and does not contain this material. These warnings are required! Labels such as G or PG are set to prove that the following is open for general audiences with and without parental supervision. Parents have the authority to monitor what their child involves himself or herself in. They can set rules for their children, saying they may only see G rated movies, or they have to have parental consent to read a magazine or novel. Parents are guardians for a reason; they need to monitor their child and care for him or her. If they do not like the music, novels, movies, etc. that their child watches, change it! They have the authority and right to do so. Instead of taking explicit material off the market to everyone, limit what you, personally, want to be off limits to your family on your own, and talk to them about it!  Katherine Paterson is completely correct when she says, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf. . . then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we were given the right to remove and books, movies, magazines, etc. that we do not believe should be on the market, it is likely that we would have no media anymore. With the billions of citizens we have in the world alone, each individual is bound to find some flaw in a certain book. With each flaw found, we would want to eliminate that book, movie, or magazine from society, thus leaving us with no variety of material to choose from. People who feel strongly about eliminating explicit material would act quickly upon this law, rather than people who are against it. This would create a corrupt society, with a lot of fighting. We, as humans, enjoy the freedoms we are given and the choices we are allowed to make. Taking the freedom of what we read or watch away from us would take away or personality and sense of expression. Books, movies, and magazines are meant to be read based on opinion, and it should remain that way.  Books, movies, and magazines should be allowed to stay on the market even when they include explicit material. The choice to read or watch this material is up to the person, and should have no influence on other humans opinions, thus ensuring a diverse and expressive society.
570	3547	2	3	To who it may concern, I believe that books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelves of a library if they are found offensive. Some books may seem offensive to some people, but to others, their perspective is a lot different. I believe that if books or other things are found offensive, they should have a special place for them, to where mature people will be able to read them. Books are very valuable to most people in the United States.  Many people love to read stuff that other people might find offensive. But is it really wrong for them to like something that someone else took the time to write? Just because one person reads a book or magazine and they find something in there that they do not like, they call it offensive. I have a feeling that a lot more people would feel the same way as I do.  Along with movies, and etc., I feel like none of them should be removed from the shelves of a library. There are kids sections, adult sections, and even a teenage section. I feel like parents nowadays don't want their children to learn about stuff early in life. But I still feel like if they did not want their kids reading it, then don't let them.  If there ever was a need to really look at something and give it another chance, this would be the topic right here. Libraries all over the world are all neat and organized. So why could they not make a section just for books, movies, magazines that people find offensive? Sure, it might take a little bit more work, but hey, someone has to do it.  As you can see, these are really good reasons why they should not remove stuff that other people find offensive from libraries. I mean half of the stuff they find anyway are based on true stories or they are biographies. People really do enjoy a lot of these books and even movies, or magazines. It would be really great if this could happen, it would make a lot of people happy and satisfied. Leaving these materials available, even in a designated section, allows for individual choice and respects the diverse interests and perspectives of library patrons.
571	3548	2	3	I believe that all types of materials should be placed in libraries to satisfy the different styles of what people like. Censorship should not play a role because everyone has their own opinions on what is looked at as offensive and what is not. By giving everyone the freedom to enjoy what they like will make a lot of people happier. The wants and needs of people vary from one extreme to the other. What one person loves, another might hate. This should not play a role in whether or not materials should be removed from public places such as a library. Everyone has the right to express themselves through art in their own way, and this freedom should be upheld. Taking away the art that some find offensive would not be fair to those who enjoy it. By doing this, not all people will be satisfied when not everyone gets what they want.  Censorship should not take part in any library. Entertainment cannot always please everyone. It will be judged in many ways no matter what anyone has to say, so the problem should just be left alone. Arguing to take away the material that some like will only cause tension to rise and make matters worse. It is understandable, for example, that a parent would not want their child to be able to be welcomed into the media world where not everything has positive influences. That's life though, and not everyone has the same outlook on it. You have to think of others, and respect their view of it all as well, recognizing that different people have different values.  Opinions will vary with what I have had to say. I strongly believe that people should be given the right to enjoy the materials they take an interest in, and access to diverse perspectives is crucial. Censorship definitely has its positives and negatives, but for the most part it is wrong and should not have a role in any library. Cutting down people's availability to their interests will only lead to frustration. You cannot please everyone, so in that case, censorship will just have to be looked beyond; ultimately, respecting individual choices and promoting intellectual freedom is the best approach for libraries to serve their communities effectively.
572	3549	2	3	Libraries hold many books and movies such as fiction, nonfiction, historical, fantasy, and adventure. These books have many different styles and portrails and many of these might be taken offensive but that doesn't mean that they can just be taken off the shelf. One book that comes to my mind that can be seen as offensive is 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'. This book talks about blacks as slaves and how they should be whipped for being let go and it call them very offensive names yet it is a classic and is in almost every book store or library in the country. Why, because it was written back when slavery was legl and slaves were treated as property not people. A movie that many people have seen recently is slumdog millionaire. This movie has a boy from a slum being tortured because he knows the answers to the questions on the gameshow 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?'. Many indians might be offended by this because they are saying if you grow up in a slum you can't be smart. But, people blow it off because it is a movie so it isn't real. But if you go to some people and ask them about these books are movies some will say they are perfectly good others might be offended so they might as weel stay on the shelfs. The book 'Gone With the Wind' is a book about the civil war could this be scene as offensive showing the thoughts of both sides saying slavery is good and bad at the same time yet it is another classic and will stay on the book shelfs. So books in libraries shouldn't be censroed because of being offensive to a race, sex, or group; they should stay on the shelf because every books other tahn some childrens books have something offensive. Thus if we took books off the shelfs for being offensive their would be nothing to read except for 'The Very Hungry Caterpillar'!
573	3550	2	3	Would you ever read a book about the Civil Rights times if you are white? Are you going to read about how people of your religion and maybe even your family were tortured? Probably not. If your a colored man/woman, are you going to engage in a book that talks about slavery? Not likely. How about if you are a mother, are you going to want to read a novel or magazine about abortion? Are you going to let your child read that book? Of course not! So you are probably wondering why they are even on the shelves, right? Its on the shelves for basically one reason, to drownd us in the knowledge it holds. Whether we are learning about criminals, racism, or wars, there is always going to be one person who is against it all. When we read, we find books that are to our own enjoyment, we look for books that can spark ideas and images in our heads. Most of us however, don't quite understand why others refuse to read such a book or even hold in their hands a book that is different from all their beliefs. Beliefs are important to people no matter their age, gender, sexuality, or their race. Its just a way of life. Some stories are there for our entertainment, some catch our emotions, and some our there for our knowledge. When authors write, they usually think of events that have happend or what they predict could happen in the future. Authors try to get you to understand the world around you, not by trying to offend you in anyway. Books tend to affect people in many ways, possitive and yes, sometimes negative. Its something they can't really control though, so you can't really blame anyone for you being offended. I don't agree that libraries shouldn't have these books on their shelves, I think they are good for us. No, i don't mean we should go around eating books. We should take time to read some of those so called offensive books. You are probably thinking, there is no way I'm going to pick up that type of book and sit down and read it. However, let me tell you that if we read these books, the more people will understand about how terrible times were back then and how some things are still bad. Take abortion into perspective. Books about abortion give us an idea about how horrible it is or how it can not only effect the women who go through with it. It appeals to the emotions of others in a way that makes them think twice about lifes decisions. Books should be kept on the shelves for our own well-being, offering different perspectives and insights. When it comes down to the choice, you will know just what to do. You know how useful books are in helping us see the differece between right and wrong. You understand why books are placed on shelves for in the first place, no its not for the money. I know that you are going to understand what I'm trying to tell you. Now head on over to your library and pick up a book about something you would like to no more about. Who knows, maybe you will get a book that makes you think twice about what information is held in between the bindings, ultimately enriching your understanding of the world.
574	3551	2	3	In my opinion, I do not believe that anyone has a choice in what children or any other age group chooses to read. It is not up to the general public to say what is right or wrong. When society says that every single child is not allowed to read a certain book, or listen to a certain song just because it is found offensive to some people, it oversteps boundaries. There are laws against restricting what a person can or can not view. There is a level of media that is not as appropriate as it should be, but that does not mean it has to go away completely. Some of the reasons society can not censor everything are because of the fact that not everyone is offended by everything, it is up to the parent of the child to say what is right or wrong, and lastly, individuality is compromised if the choices we have are limited.  When someone gets offended by the media that is out there, that does not necessarily mean that another person is also offended. When I do not like a video, or a book, or any other type of content, someone else should not have that content censored because my opinion is in the way of what they enjoy. I know that personally I would not want someone to take away my favorite book so my child could not read it. Content that is out in the public will always be unsafe to read by someone else's views. Just like I will not believe in what other people believe in, but, I will see that it is valued by others and should not remain a censored topic.  Books that are considered inappropriate, should be decided to has censorship by the parents of a young child. Decisions like that should not be left up to a group of people that has opposite views. When children are growing up and are taught the values that know today, it is their parents that teach them and not a society full of people which have different kinds of opinions. There is a saying by an author and it says 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf' and all that means if we all would have the power to remove a book or any other content from the shelf that we do not like then there would not be any books left. I believe in that saying and I also believe that many others will as well.  Individuality is when one person has different traits of feelings than another human being. We all have choices of the books we read and the music we listen to and that is why we all have individuality. When people start to think that they are allowed to remove a certain song or book because that is not what they want other people to see, then everyone will do the same and no one would have that song they enjoy or the traits that make them different because they are the only one that likes that song. If there were not any of us left on this earth that has something that they enjoyed and no one else that also enjoyed the same thing, then we would all be pretty boring. I have learned from experience that being the person that has something different about them is not a bad thing and is actually a good thing in some cases.  Also from experience I have learned that a book that is no longer on the shelf that someone has removed is not a good feeling. I would not want the same happen to all of the other books in the world. It is a very good thing to practice the art of understanding, and to have an open mind when it comes to a certain material that another person happens to enjoy. In the future, when I find a book that **might** not be a book I would want my children to read, I will just let the topic go and remember that everyone has their own opinions. So in conclusion I just want to let everyone know that books that are seen as inappropriate or offensive to one person, **might** be seen as a good thing to another, highlighting the importance of individual choice and understanding in a diverse society.
575	3552	2	3	I hear you @CAPS1. It's frustrating when magazines, movies, or music are extremely offensive. Stopping children from accessing these things is tough, given the internet's reach and the prevalence of pornography and explicit content. Voicing your opinion about inappropriate content in stores or online is a right, and those opinions should be taken seriously, especially when it comes to protecting children. It's disheartening to see such material readily available in public spaces.  The constant bombardment of pornography ads online, especially on public websites, is unacceptable. @CAPS2, there should be laws to regulate this, preventing the exposure of young children to such imagery. While understanding that money drives much of this, selling rebellious or explicit content shouldn't be the only option. Funny and entertaining content can be just as profitable.  Realistically, completely stopping this is unlikely. Protesting and hoping for a decline in its prevalence is the best course of action. Eventually, it should fade from public view, and we can only hope for the best in protecting our children and upholding our values.
576	3553	2	3	Libraries have always had interesting materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, and there always will be. Libraries are one of the best places to find those materials. I do not believe that libraries should have to remove those materials from their shelves because maybe some people find them interesting? That's all that libraries like: people interested in reading their books. If some people find different books offensive then they shouldn't go near those books. If they have a complaint then they should just keep it to themselves and not ruin the chance for others to check them out. Libraries shouldn't have to take certain material out of their shelves because some people don't like them; it's your choice to read that book, nobody is making you read something that makes you feel uncomfortable. Now say if there were a numerous amount of people that take offense to the materials in the library, then the library could decide whether they want to or not, but they still don't need to be told what to do. It's their business, and they decide what materials stay and which ones go. If I was one of those who took offense to a book in the library then I would just keep it to myself. I wouldn't like to go through all of that trouble of arguing and complaining just because of one book. Think of others before you think of yourself sometimes and what their interests are. That's less trouble you will have to go through later on in life; respecting diverse viewpoints fosters a more inclusive and understanding community for everyone.
577	3554	2	3	Materials should not be removed from library shelves. If something offends someone, they have the option to ignore it. Alternatively, they can request the material be placed on a higher shelf, maintaining their choice to access it. Many potentially offensive materials contain valuable information. Those who are offended can simply choose not to view it; one person's offense doesn't necessitate removal for everyone. If offended, ask a librarian to move the item higher. If the material is offensive, just don't check it out, and if needed, request it be shelved higher. Libraries contain diverse materials, some offensive to some, yet useful to others for research or projects. Removing materials deprives researchers of information. Books remain a primary information source, a resource diminished by censorship. The removal of materials is unnecessary because children can access similar content online. Removing library materials is futile when the internet exists. Despite efforts to shield children, they can still encounter offensive content. Therefore, offensive materials should remain available in libraries because they serve a purpose, and children will inevitably encounter such content elsewhere, anyway.
578	3555	2	3	If you saw a book on the shelf of your library that took offense to you in some way or another how would you react? Would you simply pass the book by and go on searching for another, or would you be so taken by it that you demanded it be removed from the shelves immediately? Every school, public library, movie theatre, magazine stand, and any form of media in this world will do or say one thing or another that someone is not going to like. It could be in a magazine in the do and don'ts section and you get slightly offended because you do something that is on the don't list or something about a specific race. Everyone, one time in their life, has been accidentally hurt by other peoples words and publishings in the world, but I do not think that is ever going to stop. All forms of media are for learning and entertainment purposes. These things out there in the world are not for one specific group of people, they are for everyone. Every individual person has their own opinion and not everyone else is going to agree with that person. Just because one person does not agree with which hairstyle is hot right now doesn't mean that they should take it out of their magazines for all of their viewers. To me, that is just ridiculous. So, say you stumbled across a book about the NAACP in the library and you are a person from negro descent. Would you get offended? Or, say you were watching a show that was talking about slavery a hundred years ago, would that anger you? If I were a person of negro descent it wouldn't make me mad at all, because it is just history, history that happened a long time ago that does not pertain to me. We could not toss those books out anyways because without those history books at school we couldn't learn about our history. History is important to everyone and if we didn't learn about it and they did toss those books out how would we prevent history from repeating itself? When I was a young child my father used to hit my mother, so my mother takes offense to anything in the media that has to deal with abuse. I tried to have my mother watch a movie with me called 'Precious'. The movie is about a girl who is abused by her mother and has her father's babies and she finally gets out of it and betters her and her childrens lives. My mom said that she couldn't watch it with me because, 'it hit too close to home.' Everyone is going to become offended in their life by the media. The media does not look at you as a whole, just as a population of people. When one person doesn't like something it doesn't mean it should be taken out or erased from history, it should just be rewritten or refilmed. You cannot control what everyone else says or does in books or movies, you have to just be in control of how you look upon it as. That is what I choose to do and I would say it is working out great, because choosing how you react to media is the most important thing you can do.
579	3556	2	3	No, because people like different books, movies, music, and magazines. If libraries remove them, people won't come back. They will go somewhere else to get what they need. Some people want removals, but others don't. If you don't want your kids to read, listen to, or watch certain materials, simply don't let them access them. Therefore, libraries should maintain a diverse collection to cater to everyone's preferences and respect parental choices.
580	3557	2	3	I believe that there should be some censorship in libraries, but not too much. Each person has their own interests and should be able to find something in their library to suit their interest. Certain materials are too strong to be put in libraries. There are stores that could provide you with that material for you to purchase. Most parents wouldn't like their child to be exposed to these certain materials, so they believe that the libraries shouldn't provide these types of materials. Now there are some materials that are pushing the line of their content. They are strong, but not too strong to not be put in libraries. Some people enjoy these strong materials and should be able to find them in their libraries for their pleasure. Just because someone doesn't enjoy this material that the library has provided, doesn't mean that the material should be taken away. If that was how things worked there would be nothing in the library for people to enjoy. Every person has their own taste in materials, be it more mature materials or a little more 'tame' materials. Everyone is inclined to their opinions, but their opinion doesn't decide what is and isn't in their library. I myself enjoy a wide choice of materials from libraries. Some strong materials, some more 'tame' materials. It all depends on the persons own interests and choices. Sometimes I may be disappointed when I'm looking for something in a library and it's not there, because to some people it's too strong but to me and others it's just a good source of harmless entertainment. In conclusion I think that there should be some censorship in libraries, but not so much that people can't find things that interest them. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and has their own form of entertainment, but their libraries shouldn't be built on an individual's opinions, ensuring a wider range of choices for all.
581	3558	2	3	Do you think books, music, movies or anything else that could have something offensive be removed from the shelves from our libraries? Well this is what im going to talk about in my essay. I do not think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves. The reason is, is because just because you don't like something that one book might have in it dosen't mean that another person won't. Also, some book that have offensive things in them can help you realize the consequenses that could happen of it could reinform you about those kind of things. Also if you think the reading material is going to be something you wouldn't read or you think is not appropriate then just don't read it, it saves it so when someone else that actually wants to read something like that then let them. Sometimes i will go to the library to find a book that i saw somewhere in a different store and they wouldn't have it, so i would ask about it and they said that if they didn't have it there then it must something in it that could be offensive to others. But i know that alot of people like those nasty gross books and some don't. People have different opinons about things, so just because the person that is aloud to take the books of the shelve or put them on don't like the book or thinks its not appropriate dosn't mean that someone else will not like it either. Well, here is what i think of certain books or anything else that contains reading that are being taking off the shelves. I hope it makes people realize that they do like other things than you so leave the offensive readings out so people can learn that if they don't like it then don't read it. Instead of removing materials, we should trust individuals to make their own choices about what they consume, respecting diverse perspectives and the potential for learning, even from challenging content.
582	3559	2	3	Well today i am going to talk to you about censorship in books, Music, Movies, an Magazines in your libraries, because some of them can be pretty grafic on some of the things they talk about or do in a story. But yes some of them can be more grafic than others, but that doesnt mean you have to take them off the self. Ya not everyone is into a sexual book but there are some people out there that like to read about that stuff. But some people like to read about murders an gangs selling drugs and thats fine. Its like this everyone has their own taste on what they like. it can be a novel, Penguin Classics. Sports, ESPN, just a true story that has happen to someone, an etc. thats just the part of the world. how would it be if everyone liked the same things. pretty boring right yeah deffentally. So therefore i dont think books should be takin off the shelfs. it could be the next best story for somebody. you never know. Now with music yes your so called rap today is music that your kids should not listen to. All they talks about is sex, drugs, achole, an etc. But that desnt give you the right to take them off the shelf thats what some people like to listen too. but there is some music out there that dont just talk about that. there is the oldies, country, jazz, hip hop, an etc. but for the most part all music is good its just some of them are better than others, lets take country for instents ya it talks about some sex, an some achole but thats not the whole song they manly talk about country boys an the things they do or have happened to them over time, an they are pretty much right. So all music is good, but without music i dont think the world would be a very nice place. people listen to music all the time. when working out, at work, driving, or just siting at home. So there are some good music an bad muic you make the call. But with movies there are some movies made just for that reason its all call intertainment for adults. which yes is kinda pointless, but its there an prolly wont ever leave. there are movies made for sex, drugs, an achole. thats just the part of life, everything is not perfect. So in that matter you gota tell your children about this stuff in stop them from watching it at a younge age. because i think it is taking a big role in teen pregnecy, beacuse it they see it an hey it looks fun we shoud try it, and sexual content is so easy to get. its all over the web an etc. its like drugs they are so easy to get. there are meth labs all over for meth. an there is weed all arund. you just gota tell your kids what they can watch an cant. Disney, Nickelodeon, an Cartoon Network are all great shows for kids. so parents be the boss about that stuff. Now we get to Magazines. there are millions of magazines all aound the world, they are one thing that will never leave this world. they carry news, intertainment, comics, or tips on how to do somethng. thats what is going to be in this world till the world ends. But yes take with caution there are some magazines out there that your children should never look at till adults. but that doesent make them bad people injoy looking at them kinda magazines thats just what people like. its not like your going to stop your son from looking at a Playboy or your daughter from looking at porn. its all apart of life. but you can stop it from happening at a younge age. you just gota get it clear to your child to not look at this stuff till your older. but you cant stop everything. But all i am trying to say is yes there is some bad things out there an their is alot of good things to. but that doesnt give you the right to remove them, and we should instead focus on guiding younger individuals to make informed decisions.
583	3560	2	3	Do I think offensive reading materials should be taken off the shelves in libraries? No, books should not be taken out of libraries. If students go to school and they are in high school they pretty much already know what is going on around the world. Teens do talk about their lives so pretty much EVERYONE knows what is going on. High school students are going to hear. If the parents are sending their child to school and they don't want them to hear about it then don't send them to school! In school they will hear verbal arguments and see fights. If the parents don't want them to hear about it from other kids than they tell them, they explain it to them. One way or another they will find out. It can come from the parents, their friends, teachers anybody. Teens do not care if your child is watching when they are fighting; they are not worried about that at that time. The saying 'one person ruins it all for everybody,' well thats because some teens need to grow up and act their age. If you can't act your age than you shouldn't be in the grade you are in. Kids and teens need to grow up if they can't read a book without being inmature about it than don't read it. If their parents let them watch movies that they think they are old enough to watch than don't take advantage of that. Taking books out of the libraries will not change anything. Kids will still fight and rough house. Yeah some books are a little outragous, but not all books. To be honest libraries should have sections of books depending on the age or grade they are in. High schoolers should be able to control reading about sex, drugs, or drinking. If they are not responsible to read that than they shouldn't get that book anyway. Songs made today can get a little out of hand. If your child listens to that kind of music with all the bad words, talking about sex, drugs, alchol. Than parents all you got to do is take those songs away. Teens that are mature shouldn't get punished just because inmature can't watch a movie, listen to song, read a book or a magazine. It's not fair to those people. People that act their age should be able to read, watch the movie, or anything just because they can handle the situation better. So don't punish everybody just because of some inmature kids that ruin it for everybody, because censorship is never the answer.
584	3561	2	3	I am writing to reflect my views on censorship in libraries. I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I don't believe they should be removed because everyone has their own personal opinion on what's acceptable or not. Just because one person doesn't like something or feel that it's offensive doesn't mean that everyone is going to feel that way. What one person might not like the next person might love. The only way that I feel a certain material should be removed from the shelf is that if there are many complaints about the same material; then maybe the library should consider removing the item or relocating it. That's why they have ratings and different sections in the library so that a person can know what kind of book they're going to read or what kind of movie they're going to watch. It makes no sense to go get a book or movie about something that you don't like or that you think is offensive, as there are many things to choose from. How would someone feel if one of their favorite books or movies were being removed from the shelves of libraries because another person didn't like it? They would be upset and disappointed about the situation, and it could limit access to diverse perspectives. In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that materials should be removed from shelves simply because they are considered offensive by some, and I hope that you will understand my point of view and take consideration of my thoughts.
585	3562	2	3	hey, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. First, I know that people have different views upon things such as magazines, books, and music. And I also know that there are somethings that @MONTH1 might be offensive to you, but they aren't offensive to other people. Such as music, there are all kinds of music out there. And I know that some people find rap music offensive and some don't, because a lot of people that don't find it offensive relates to it. Second, I feel that if the people that find it offensive would just ignore it then it wouldn't be a problem. Because I know that maybe there is a type of magazine, book, or even a type of music that they listen to that is offensive to someone else; they might not find it offensive, but I bet someone else finds it offensive. So for them to judge these things wouldn't be right. Third, I'm pretty sure that if something in the library was too offensive the library wouldn't have it in the first place. But maybe if we would take the time out and worry about our self instead of worrying about what's offensive and what's not then the world might be a better place. And yes, I understand that people have different views, but we shouldn't let that get to us. So you can see, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive, because there are billions of people on this earth and I doubt they would all give you the same answer, because so many people have different opinions, and beliefs upon things, and censorship limits access to diverse perspectives.
586	3563	2	3	According to Katherine Paterson, who wrote an article about censorship in the library, should we be able to have the right to take a book, magazine, movie etc. off the shelf freely, whether if we're offended by it or not? I believe we should not have that right to pull things off of shelves freely. If we had that right it would cause problems from many stand points if you think about it. One problem it could cause is people's thoughts towards a book, movie, CD, and so forth. If one person looks at it and is like 'I don't like this and this about it' and then just pulls it off the shelf, then that's one less thing for somebody who does like it. Now since that person doesn't like what the material offers to the public, doesn't mean somebody else doesn't. Nobody in this entire world is exactly the same. Everybody in this world has their likes and dislikes. If they had the freedom to take things, then there would be nothing for anybody to read, listen to, watch, eat, etc.  You also have to think how that would affect the business of stores, libraries, and other businesses. If everybody is pulling everything off shelves, what would there be to sell or read? If a business is not making any money, then they're going to have to be closed down. Especially in today's economy no business wants to run low on money.  In Katherine's article at the end she said 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' That is basically reiterating what I said earlier about people's likes and dislikes about everything. If you don't want your kids or anybody else's kids looking at something you believe is offensive, you should take it up with one of the workers so they can move it to a different section, like a section for older kids and people. Mainly it falls on parents on what content you want your kids looking at. You're the ones to raise them the way you want to raise them. If you think they are too young for something then that's when you tell them no or whatever. We should not have the right to take anything off of a shelf because restricting access based on personal offense is a slippery slope that ultimately diminishes the availability of diverse materials for everyone. Books, movies, music and etc. are for entertainment, and if it doesn't entertain you does not mean it does not for anybody else.
587	3564	2	3	There are a ton of books out in the world that have a deep meaning and a sense of compassion. But, other books can have mean or hateful affects on the person who is reading it. Censorship, taking books, movies, magazine, etc. off the shelves so a person cannot read or watch them, is a very positive thing. In many cases censorship is a great thing. It protects young readers from being exposed to hateful things at such a young age. In libraries, the librarian should censor the books for younger people so they do not read the awful and hurtful things the book is saying. Like books, music, movies, and magazines should be censored, too. Some music has a very catchy beat to it and could get stuck in a young person's head. This could cause an effect on that child and they could start to act like that or want to become like the person the song is describing. Movies should also be censored. When I was little, my parents did a good job of censoring things that were bad for me to watch at that age. I barely had any nightmares because I was never exposed to that kind of writing when I was a child. On the other hand, my friend's parents were not the best at censorship and allowed her to watch or read whatever she wanted. She had many nightmares from the movies or books that she read. Now since I am older my parents are starting to let me watch and read more censored things. In my experiences with this type of material, I have had some nightmares and have personally been offended by some books. Although, censored books can have a great story behind them, the material that supports it can cause a dispute between different people who have different beliefs. Thousands of books are censored each year. Many of them have to do with different religions or races that people have different opinions on. Libraries need to censor books to protect the innocent minds of young children, ensuring they are shielded from potentially harmful content and allowed to develop without premature exposure to divisive or offensive material.

As I stated before for it is @ORGANIZATION1 neccessary to remove an item from the shelves because someone has taken offense to something.

589	3566	2	3	Should offensive or graphic books be removed from the library? Well, in my point of view, I think books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are amazing, exciting, and fun to read or watch, and they should not be removed from the shelves in the local library. For a fact, people, in general, have many types of tastes in books; there's drama, romance, action, and many others that also apply to movies, magazines, and etc. The public should not be punished for one's interest in themes, and how they take the book. There should be an age limit in which kids can't read certain books, and those of age should read whatever they please.  I, myself, like to read scary books; they give me chills, and all types of questions run through my brain. Someone else from my community could have the same trait of thought I have when reading a scary book. Without books that don't fit our personality, there would be fewer people in libraries reading and more people trying to keep themselves occupied, and half of them might even get bored and start committing crimes to keep themselves occupied. People in the community have rights to read, hear, or watch whichever type of material they like.  If people really do have a hard time with some of the material that is on display, they should not even pick it up to begin with. They should look for stuff they would enjoy, not just because the book is about 'violence' or they simply don't like the theme; they should not hold it against other people that might enjoy it. Books and other material were meant for us to enjoy them and from the authors' or directors' choice to share with us their stories. Without books like those, many people can't get ideas to help them create their own book or novel.  So that is my view on the situation; people should enjoy whatever material they like. But, if you are one of those people that think books, movies, magazines should be removed, take a day and read a book or see a movie from your local library and see how it will change your mind. Ultimately, access to diverse materials fosters creativity and personal growth, and restricting access based on subjective offense would be a disservice to the community and the freedom to explore different perspectives.
590	3567	2	3	There are many types of reading materials for people to read in a library. You can find things on cars, trucks, sports, and made up stories for fun. There are some materials in a library though that could be offensive. But should those materials be removed from the library? Some think that they should and others think that they shouldn't be. In my opinion I don't think that things should be removed from a library. Certain people find things offensive and others find it is perfectly fine to have in a library. I think there should be certain areas and age limits for certain materials a person could find in a library. I think that there should be age limits for certain types of reading material. People don't want a little child to read something that is meant to be for an adult. That would teach kids bad things that they don't need to be reading about. I think that there should be an area set for kids that are in elementary to high school and there should be a section that is for adults. That way kids aren't reading things that are meant for adults. I also think that are there should be more signs that show more about what some books are about. Like if there are books on slavery they should have an area for books that are about that that way people who are offended be it know to stay away from it. The same with magazines. i don't think they should be removed from a library if they are found offensive to some people because other people enjoy reading them. Some reading material can be found offensive to certain people but to others it may not be. I think things shouldn't be removed from libraries. There are some things that people need to have in a library if they are doing a project that way they have the resources to do it. I do think that certain movies and music should be removed from shelves if little kids are aloud in the store. kids don't nedd to be watching adult movies while they are in elementary school. That just isn't right. Espaecially if the movie is promoting sex, violence, and other things that young kids should not be doing. So in my opinion there are some things that should and should not be removed from a library. Music and movies that promote things that young children should not be doing, along with magazines and other such materials, should be kept away to where only adults could get to them, but other reading materials should remain available for research and informational purposes.
591	3568	2	3	I do not believe that censorship should be an option for people that find a book, magazine, or movie offensive. I believe that if a person decides to take a book off the shelf because he/she is offended, they are obviously paranoid. If a few cuss words are found in a book and a person doesn't want their children to read that book, then don't allow them to get it. Don't make all of the other people suffer. Censorship is an unnecessary solution to something that isn't even a problem. You know what they say, 'If it ain't broken, don't fix it.' FIRST of all, people have a variety of opinions. Some people think that violence is ok and some people don't think it's ok. If one person decides to put a book off the shelf because they find it offensive, what will the next person think? They MAY find violence perfectly acceptable and they might allow their kids to read the book. Then it would create a big conflict. Lastly, parents need to allow their kids to grow up and mature. They also need their kids to know the difference between right and wrong. If they don't read books or movies with violence or cuss words when they're young, what will they do when they discover it when they're older? As a child, it is a time to learn life lessons and begin to form clear distinctions between right and wrong. Shielding your children from it will only hinder their progress in figuring things out and learning to think for themselves as adults. Censorship is the same thing that HITLER did to prevent people to think for themselves and discover that his tactics were a great evil to society. In other words, censorship is part of fascism and should not even be considered in DEMOCRATIC society. The citizens of AMERICA have the responsibility of exposing the truth and teaching our children the differences between right and wrong. It's one of the ideals that help make this country great, and we should protect our rights to think freely and access information without unnecessary restrictions.
592	3569	2	3	Censorship. Sometimes it's needed, sometimes it's not. Children of today are exposed to many adult things, whether it is watching tv or a movie, or just witnessing things at home. I believe censorship is necessary for young children; they shouldn't be exposed to bad language or graphic scenes, or something that is strictly for adults. They will experience these things one day, and they need to be mature enough to understand them. Teenagers, on the other hand, are a whole different story. They want to hear the bad language and see graphic, gory scenes. It's all about action to the boys, drama for the girls, and everyone wants to hear those juicy details. Censorship won't stop them from moving on to the next movie or book on the shelf that has all these things in them. Even though all teens act like it's not important and that they're old enough to see all this, sometimes they're probably not. If you think that telling your teenage daughter or son that they're not allowed to watch a movie or read a book because of something it says, they'll probably just go log onto the internet and see it anyway. Nothing is censored on the internet, so if you're all about censorship, don't go onto to the internet. Adults do not need censorship. They're adults; they can make their own decisions, and they know what they want to watch or read. Removing things from the shelves of libraries is sometimes needed. There should be sections: children, teens, and adults. There are ratings on movies, and books are written for a certain age limit, so everything should be placed accordingly. Censorship is needed, but your parents or guardian are the ones who will most likely tell you whether or not you're going to be able to read a book or watch a movie. Some people find things more offensive than others, so censorship is really in the eye of the beholder. Personally, I believe in censorship, but to others, it's a waste of time. I wouldn't want my child watching a movie where someone gets brutally murdered and where they're cussing every other word. Music can come uncensored and censored; it just depends on what you want to hear. Ultimately, censorship is either loved or hated, and its effectiveness and justification are, in the end, all one big opinion.
593	3570	2	3	Each book in a library bears its own relation to each person that enters that library. Whether the books relate well or poorly to each person is not something for a mass of people to decide. Every person has a different outlook on what makes a story interesting. There will not ever be a book that every human being agrees to be both appropriate and vivacious. Designed with distinctly different minds, people want to read distinctly different books, written by distinctly different authors. People should maintain a right to choose which books he or she may want to read. Never, will one book bind the world. Minds of human beings are too complexly separated. For example; reading 'The Odyssey' by Homer in my English class last year was more than appropriate, though rather boring for the majority of the class. Books of racism, religion, and sexual content intrigue a person's mind, or otherwise disgust one's. Finding satisfactory books for everyone in a community to agree simply will not ever be done. There will always be that one person who declines to agree. It is a choice. It is a choice for each person to read what he or she wants to read. If you force something upon a society of readers, then what will they have left for their own minds' freedom? Face it, forcing an atheist to read an emotionally comprehensive novel of the Christian faith will not be stood for by the reader. Cursing, to some people, brings a book to a realistic point. To others, however, it draws them further and further away from the story. A choice should remain a person's right; especially to read a book written to be read. Finding an appropriate book is not the problem. That has yet to become the problem. The only problem is finding appropriate books that are both compelling and enthralling. I find 'Lolita in the Library' to be dangerously inappropriate. However, it captivates my mind beyond other dimensions. Others that I know choose not to read it because of the offensive content. Do I find it offensive to some? No, but I understand where others could find it offensive. There is no way to approve a book to not be offensive, because it is not offensive to every person who reads it. To reiterate, the mind of human is a unique one, that identifies with no other. To sum up the full idea of this position; every person should be given the choice to read what he or she desires. Give each person the choice, and the rebellion will settle down. Removing a book from a shelf just puts the craving in the hearts of certain people to read it; sometimes completely rebelliously. Katherine Paterson is extremely correct by saying that taking a book from a shelf everytime someone wants one banned will not leave books for anyone. As a person, I am well associated with my mind, and it desires the freedom of choice. Every human mind desires the freedom to choose. Give people the choice. Remove no books from a shelf, and let the outcome draw in whoever is interested in whatever they may be interested in. Let readers have their freedom.
594	3571	2	3	In society today, people take things in very many different ways. So things that might help one person, may offend another. In libraries, there are different kinds of books; fiction, non fiction..(etc). So if you dont like a particular book, maybe you should try looking in a different area. I do not think books should be removed from the shelf because the book has offended a few people. We are blessed to live in America, where we have freedom of speech. So authors have freedom to write what they would like to. They work long hard hours getting a book ready to be published and then someone wants to take it off the shelf because it offended a few people? I do not think that is right. 'One man's junk is another man's treasure.' I think this quote goes along with this topic very well, because the book may not mean something to one person but it may mean the world to someone else. You never know what people might need to hear. Maybe an alcoholic is at a point in his/her life and is ready to change, and someone has a book about a recovering alcoholic. Now, this kind of book may offend a few people, but it may save a family, a friendship or maybe even a life. Take Anne Frank for intance, her journal is now a book. Now this may offend a few people that might have been there or maybe don't like Anne Frank, but her story has the right to be told. Yes, there is violence in it, and i understand that maybe you don't want your 10 year old to hear about how they use to treat African American women, but the story has the right to be told, and should be told. I do not think that the librarian has the right to take a book off the shelf at the library, just because it has offended a few. There are lots of different kinds of books, if the books you are reading offend you, look for a different type of book. Therefore, we should respect the diversity of literature and the freedom of expression, allowing readers to choose what resonates with them without censorship.
595	3572	2	3	I think a lot of books are good to read because some of them will tell you more about what you didn't know. Therefore, you might pick up a book that you like and read it, and you might like it, but it doesn't always have more meaning. A lot of books you read have some type of character in them that might talk about something opposite from what another character is talking about. Magazines sometimes show you what a person's lifestyle is like. Some books that people read have no action or feeling in them, so they can just pick them up and read. It's always good to pick up a reasonable book so someone can read books that are positive and would mean something to other people. I think the best book is one that tells you about life and what you need to know to succeed in life. You might run into a book that is true and get into it so you can learn something. Sometimes you can read and write about it in an essay paper. A magazine and movie book shows a lot of action and what it's like, what they do. Most people might think it's boring to read an unaction book, so they get a book that has action to excite them more than a regular book, but most books have more pictures than words in them. You should take a book off the shelf that has what you need to know because action books might not help you all the time, and the more action-filled, fun books you read are not as good as what another book is taking place at in a story. This is why selecting books with substance and meaning is crucial for personal growth.
596	3573	2	3	In our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes. Items should not be removed from the shelves just because someone takes offense to it. Everyone has a book or movie out there that they disagree with, but if it is removed just for that reason then there would be a very limited selection left. Students would take advantage of this and they would have educational books removed. Removing items from shelves removes history. Our history books tell us stories of slavery and discrimination. If someone takes offense to this and has it removed then we are losing a part of our history that needs to be heard and taught so that it does not occur again. Items in the library are items that you can choose to check out or choose to not check out. If you take offense to an item in the library then you do not have to read it. Something that you may take as offensive could be something that inspires and encourages someone else. Whether you like an item or dislike it is a matter of your own personal opinion and decisions should not be made based on someone's opinion alone. Consider the impact of censorship on intellectual freedom.  Think about it. If you have a favorite book, movie, or song then would you want it to be gotten rid of based on someone's opinion? You have the right to be able to read, watch, or listen to whatever you want. It should not be limited based on someone else's opinion. It would cause much argument among people. Some have different opinions than others on a certain item in the library which will lead to argument and possible violence. The removal of items can create division.  There are so many wonderful and inspiring books and movies out there and there is always going to be someone who does not like at least one of them. If items are removed based on someone's opinion then there will be a very limited selection left. People read for enjoyment and knowledge. They deserve to have a wide selection to choose from. The freedom to choose what one reads is vital for personal growth.  In our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes. Our opinions should not be based on a person's dislike of something. If they take offense to it then they have the right to ignore it. There are so many books and movies out there that teach us of life before our generation. We need these books and movies so that there are not repeat events of all of the rough times our ancestors had to go through. We need these books for future generations so that we are able to teach and guide them. Items should not be removed from the shelves based on the fact that someone takes offense to it, as this limits access to diverse perspectives and historical understanding.
597	3574	2	3	Practice Censorship You Decide The United States is considered one of the greatest countries in the world because it is a free country. In the 1900's people migrated here to escape the control that their government had in their homeland. In America we practice freedom of speech. If we censor materials like books, music, movies, etc. it would defeat the entire purpose of America and it's Constitution.  Everyone has their own personality with likes and dislikes. Not everyone likes the same music or is interested in reading the same subject, thats why its wonderful that their is a variety of everything. If you start banning or censoring certain things then how will people learn? There is nothing wrong with learning about negative things because that teaches people lessons so they know what or what not to do if in that situation. When you censor 'bad things' it creates naive thinkers, which only leads to discrimination.  I agree that for children there should warnings for material that parents may find offensive. For example, movies have ratings for different age groups, and books could do the same. Of course its up to the parents if they want to follow the recommendations but banning something all together is not neccessary.  I personally learned a lot of things from shows I've seen on television. Whats on television may be considered 'street smart' education but that is good. Today we live in a scary and violent society, so being 'street smart' is an advantage. If television was censored then people would not know what to do in a bad situation because they have never experienced or seen of it before.  If books, movies, magazines, music, etc. are removed from shelves then The United States is not practicing what it preaches to the many of people who come here in search of freedom, and ultimately undermines the very principles upon which the nation was founded.
598	3575	2	3	Censorship should play a major part in deciding which books should enter and leave the library. That's why I think that if a book, movie, magazine, or CD is found offensive to at least ten children, it should definitely be removed from the shelf. Now, it would be asking too much to have the librarian read through all the books to make sure there is no bad language or anything else that a parent might not want their child to read about. So, therefore, a library should have a certain section that, if a librarian thinks that there might be some bad language or reference to drugs or alcohol, then that book should go into that part of the library. I have found some books that have some pretty graphic material in them that I don't think a little kid should be reading, but there was nothing I could do about it except take it up to the librarian.  Movies would be a major thing that they would have to watch out for. Just because the movie has a title that doesn't seem that bad doesn't mean that there won't be any graphic images in that movie or that there won't be any inappropriate language used at one point in the movie. Now, since movies are a lot easier to review and since they also have a rating, then that should make it easier to tell if that movie should go on the shelves of a library or not. But there should definitely be a part in the library that, if they did want to allow certain movies in there that would be inappropriate for little children, then those movies should be put in that part of the library that has a door on it so the kids would know not to go in that room.  Music would be another thing you would definitely have to watch out for because with each song could change how the language is in that CD. So I think that the librarian should have to sit down and personally listen to that CD before they decide to put it out on the shelves for others to be able to listen to. But personally, I think that there should be no music allowed in libraries just because with every new CD album that an artist makes, he could easily change how his wording is in the songs. So you just never know what the artist of the song is going to do with his music. One album can be perfectly fine and not have one cuss word on it, but then the next album that he or she makes could just be loaded with cuss words.  Another possible way to prevent little kids from hearing or reading about inappropriate stuff is to have some of the books, magazines, CDs, or movies categorized by age. As a child gets older, he will be taught more about certain things. Then once he picks up that book and sees that it's mentioned in the book, it won't be that big of a shock to him or his parents. With the way things are today, it's almost impossible for a kid to pick something up and not read about drugs or violence. So if you were to go through and take everything off the shelf that mentioned drugs or violence, then there would be nothing left on the shelves for kids to listen to or read.  You're not going to be able to catch every single movie, book, magazine, or CD that has something to do with violence or alcohol use. But you can take some of the stuff that has a lot of that kind of stuff in it off the shelf. By just taking some of the materials off the shelf that contain stuff that seems inappropriate for children will definitely make a big difference, and it could possibly protect your child from reading across it someday when he or she reads a book and sees that or listens to a CD and hears the artist mention something about that.  Game designers are now starting to make all their games around violence. So if you were to take all the games that have violence in them and take them off the shelf, there would be no games left for kids to play. So there are just some things that contain violence that you just can't keep your child from seeing at one point in time. All the games have a rating on them so you should have an adult check that game rating before you let your child get that game. By doing that, you will be able to somewhat control what your child will see, and it will also make it better because then you are not taking games that other kids might like off the shelf and making them no longer available.  So I have pretty much covered about how whoever is in charge of the games, books, movies, and CDs should look them over and possibly listen or look at them just to see what they are like before they put them out on the shelf. You don't have to censor everything, but there are definitely some things out there that should not be put out on the shelves for little kids to look at or listen to. And if a little kid wants to get
599	3576	2	3	Do I believe that some books should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive? Well what do you think? I think they should depending on the cause or degree of the party being offended. I feel if there are books, movies, or music that are saying or showing a form of insults then it depends on who is being offended.  If you have a racist book against all races like blacks, Asian, or Mexican etc... other minorities find out about those forms of insults and they raise an issue about it, then yes take it off the shelves.  If you have a confrontation about it then it could get violent. Also, if you don't then they could sue you for racism or make it public to everyone that you are a racist library and you would lose business.  So to avoid all of the fighting and lawsuits and other humiliation against you and the other minorities, if they bring up a situation then just take it off the shelves so you can stay safe and them as well.  Plus, they only come here for an opportunity to start a new life cause usually they're coming from poverty stricken towns, home countries. I myself, am not a racist person I think that we are equal just unique individuals we're all unique in our own ways that is what makes us who we are today; ultimately, removing harmful material can foster a safer and more inclusive environment for everyone.
600	3577	2	3	Many people have many different thoughts and beliefs. Some people @MONTH1 may believe that a movie or song needs to be removed, but others @MONTH1 disagree, and nobody wants the things they enjoy to be taken away. If there was a book on a shelf in a bookstore that you didn't agree with and thought should be removed, and you removed it, then you are taking away from someone who @MONTH1 may enjoy that book. If everyone removed things from life that they didn't enjoy, then there would be very little to enjoy. For example, I personally love horror movies. I love the thrill you get from a horror movie and how they can make you jump even though it's just a movie screen. I'm sure there are people in this world who think horror movies are wrong. If those people were allowed to just remove them forever, I, and many other people, would be sadly dissapointed. I also love video games. Video games are a huge part of my life, and I know for a fact that there are people who highly disagree with some of the content of them. If people could take video games away because they didn't agree with them, i would be crushed. I am also aware that people @MONTH1 may just be worried about their children watching movies, listening to songs, or reading books that are not appropriate for them. I understand that the parents want their children to be supervised, but removing the books, movies and songs is not exactly the answer. Movies and books can easily be censored. Many movies and songs have language filters and some movie programs now have parental options that allow the parents to decide what movies they want to allow their children to watch. Parents can also supervise their children when they download music onto an ipod or phone, and depending on where they are bought, books and magazine's @MONTH1 often require parental consent. Video games also require parental consent depending on the rating of the game. We can't just go around removing everything we dont like, because it is not fair to those who @MONTH1 may like it. We live in a world with many different ideas, thoughts and beliefs, and we all need equal right to share them, meaning that censorship based solely on personal dislike is ultimately detrimental to a diverse and tolerant society.
601	3578	2	3	Today in society there are many things people have different views on. They can be religion, race, or brought up in a different way. Today in libraries there are many books of all types. They can relate to all different kinds of people. If one book is discriminating against another individual is this right? I think the libraries need to stay the way they are and leave things the way they have had them for different reasons. First off, no one is the same, what might be bad to someone else can be good to another person. If someone simply doesn't like the context of a book, movie, or even music ect. They don't have to read, watch, or listen to it. Since no one is the same what someone might not find appealing can be an amazing thing to another person. Second, this can be there for purpose. The United States wasn't always an equal place. If there are books that talk about the discrimination on other races I think it's simply showing history. If we didn't have history to look back on we wouldn't be able to see how America has progressed. From slave states to all free states. I think it is important for material such as that to be left so it can be looked upon. Third reason, is a library is supposed to consist of these different things such as books, movies, music ect. If we were to take everything out the libraries that comes off offensive it wouldn't be a place were you could find things that you wanted. It would probably be a boring place. If there's no variety in a library I don't see how it can be called a library. You can find whatever your looking for in a library whether it's on how to do hair to the history of the CIVIL WAR. In conclusion, these reasons make up why libraries should stay the way they are. One is because what might be offensive to an individual might be different to someone else. Second, it would take a lot away from history. Third, it wouldn't make a library what it is today; diverse and comprehensive. These are legitimate reasons why it should be left alone.
602	3579	2	3	In our public libraries we can find books that are related to slavery, drugs, gangs, prostitution and violence. These books all have history in them of our past. We cannot, as a society, forget our past because as many historians say, history repeats itself. If we start censoring our libraries then all that history will be forgotten, and/or lost.  Libraries can help us in many different ways. They help us with school projects, business projects, and libraries better our knowledge as a person. You cannot go censoring the libraries just because someone finds a book offensive. The stories of slavery are still taken offensively among people today, but if we start taking stories about people who have been enslaved and hide them from the people, we will slip back into that terrible past.  There are gang stories of terrifying people, such as Al Capone and Pablo Escobar. He killed many people, destroyed many shops and probably even sold a lot of drugs. We need history to show our weakness as a nation and not hide because of this weakness but thrive on it to better our cities, better our police training, and most importantly, better the next generation of kids to be raised better.  There is more than just books at the public library, there are movies and documentaries of our nation and the world. Movies that talk about World War 1 and World War 2. These types of movies can show how horrifying war really is and how cruel people can get. During World War 2, there was the Holocaust where six million jews lost their lives because one person, Adolf Hitler, did not like them. People made movies like those to show the world how devastating man can be but people have made movies on amazing discoveries and amazing places. For example Neil Armstrong. One of the greatest findings among the world.  Music can also be a good way to better one's self. If you play an instrument and you need music to play to, why not go to the library to get some? You don't have to worry about paying for a $20 cd and you can use it until your done with it then return. Then with how advanced our technology is, people can get cd's to burn on to a computer and put on their iPod or mp4 player. Plus the library is a good place to just go look for music you like.  So, should there be censorship in our libraries? NO! There should not and the key reason as to why is because it is history. History of our country, history of our world, and history of sad and hard times. Instead of censoring our youth of today from history we need to set age limits. Young people of a certain age can not read certain books unless they are with a parent or guardian. That is one simple way to keep our kids from reading too mature thing but still able to get the history he/she needs because as historians always say, history repeats itself and as a growing nation, we need to better ourselves in every way possible, and the answer to that is through an uncensored understanding of our history.
603	3580	2	3	I don't think books that would offend people should be on the shelf. Some of the books that may be on the shelf @MONTH1 hurt someone's feelings. But I also think people should be able to read what they want to read; many people wouldn't read a book that they think would offend them.  There are many kinds of books; not all books will be bad or offend people, but books that are not appropriate for young kids or teens shouldn't even be in school libraries. In public libraries, I think it should be okay to have every type of book and have different books in different places, like having the young adult section and the adult and children's sections.  I think certain books should be sold in bookstores; like, I don't think they should have inappropriate books in children's bookstores. They should have a different store for certain books, and parents should monitor what their children are reading and take part in the book by helping them understand what the book is saying.  There are lots of parents that don't really care about what their kids read, and to me, that's their business, but my opinion is that they shouldn't let their kids read whatever they want. Parents should be with the child when he/she is picking out a book. But if it is a teen @DATE1 and older, I think they would be old enough to choose what they want to read; by the time they are that age, they have matured enough to read and understand things much easier, which gives them more autonomy in their reading choices.
604	3581	2	3	Hi im henry and I agree that if there are books in a school libray or a public libray that are offensive they should be removed. im a type of person who belives that offensive books shouldnt be in librays because i ahte seeing people upset or mad because they read a book that effened them. That inclues magazines and movies and even music. myself henry has read a few books that has effened my self or has made fun of black people and i have black friends. if I could have it my way i would have all books like that out of school librays and public librays. And i say that because little kids dont need to be reading that kind of stuff and neither do we. thats just like music now days you turn on a radio station and people are cussing and making fun of other colored people. Also you cant understand what there saying half the time. They need to put on music that u can understand that doesnt have cussing in it and that you can understand because some kids like to listen to music. magazines, I look at alot of magazines my self but there all like coonhunting magazines or four-wheeler ones lookin for tires or somthing like that. but yes also the bad magazines need t go to that way little kids arent looking at them. also it mite help some crime to stop to. I say that because people look at magazines that have shooting in then and that have crime in them to. So people see that and there like i wanna try this somtime. so then they call there buddies and say lets try this and most of them do then there in trouble. so i think that it would be helpful to get all the bad magazines that were made and throw them away and things mite change. make some that have like cartoons in them and comics for the little kids. you could even try and make some good health ones that advertise good health for people and teens. To me things would possibly change if we get all the naughty things out of book,magazines,music. Movies, this is a big one just about all the movies are bad. There are some good ones out there if u look. but i dont know how we could change the movies by anycahnce at all. That was my opion on things. i hope it all makes sense about how i feel and how i think about things.  Specifically, I think if we replaced the negative magazines with positive ones, it could influence kids' behavior. Maybe even create some new, engaging content that helps them learn and grow in a healthy way. It's hard to know where to start with movies, but addressing books, music and magazines seems like a step in the right direction to creating a more positive environment for everyone.
605	3582	2	3	
606	3583	2	3	I do believe that certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I think offensive books, movies, music, and etc., should be removed from shelves because that is basically encouraging young children that if they see something inappropriate, it's okay to watch. I would not want my brother or sister to watch or see anything that is not appropriate. I remember there was a time I was thirteen years old, and my mom and stepdad at the time did not agree that I should have MTV, BET, or V103 on my television. They thought that I was too young to be watching what was on television and it was inappropriate in their opinion. I disagreed with that; I thought I should have the right to watch it because I liked the shows, and they were interesting to watch. Everything that was on television was not as bad in my opinion. When I would watch music videos on BET, every song that was being played was the edited version. I had to argue and prove a point in why I should have V103, BET on my television. Parents all have a different opinion in what is good and what is bad for their children. In my case, my mom did not want me to watch anything that was bad. She knew what it was like when she was young. She thought that maybe I would think what I see on television is not a bad thing. I was thinking to myself that oh well, I am young, and I will eventually learn in the long run from what is good and what is bad, which is why I still believe that removing potentially harmful materials is a necessary step in protecting children.
607	3584	2	3	TAKING THE BLAME TO READERS Everyone will read a book in their lifetime at some point in their life. The author cannot filter through the entire book to remove offensive language, racial remarks, slurs, etc. One offensive to a person may not be offensive to another. I strongly disagree that books should be removed if they are found offensive to a specific group, person, or community. Most books are organized in categories by maturity and genre. The reader should know where he/she stands among these categories, so they will not be offended. Maturity comes with understanding.  Books are sorted by genre. Most, if not all, times the reader takes from the genre. The era of when the book takes place is also a key factor. When writing an author must take this into consideration. If the setting of the book was in 1600 A.D. the author would not want to use grammar from the present day. The reader should be prompted on what books they may read before doing so.  From one reader to another, taking the blame on what we read is the real solution. Maturity comes with understanding. If the reader is mature enough to understand the content then the book corresponds with the age of that child. This is why I strongly agree that books shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive to one person, group, or community, as individual discernment should be prioritized.
608	3585	2	3	Should we take off books that are offensive? I think that we should not take them off if they are offensive. If we do take the offensive stuff off the shelf then there are not any more on the shelf. If all of us could take off the book, movie, or music that is offensive to us then there will be no books, movies, or music on the shelf.  First off all, there will be no war books, movies, or music on the shelf. All the hippies will take the war stuff off because they don't like war. They will say that it is offensive to them and take them off. I think that we should read about war and watch them because it is a good way to learn our mistakes. If we don't learn the mistakes of war we will lose and we won't learn how we lost and we will go into war over and over again we will win some and lose a lot because we won't learn how we lost. Ignoring history means repeating it.  Secondly, all the music that are good and bad will be taken off the shelf. All the mothers that are too protective, they will take them down because it has bad language in it and a bad theme to it. If they take them down how can the football players, soldiers, and fighters be ready for the fight if they don't have the songs that they like to listen to and get pumped for the fight? The music helps them prepare mentally and physically.  Finally, they will take out all the books of Star Wars and Forgotten Realms. Some people don't like them because they think that it won't come true and they will take them out and say that it offends them thinking-wise. Star Wars is a good book and movie and Forgotten Realms is a good book maker company. These stories spark imagination and creativity.  All of this is why I don't want this to happen. All the good music, books, and movies will go away and the people who like them will get mad. We need to tolerate diverse perspectives and artistic expression, even if we find some of it disagreeable, to avoid a bland and uninspiring cultural landscape.
609	3586	2	3	Everyone person can think of something that we did not like or want to see. If you were offended by that one thing, do you think you should have the right to have it taken away or banned? Or what if you liked the choice of what the place had, but someone else didn't? Should they have the right to take it away just because they don't approve? What if 100 people came into a library with 10,000 books, magazines, music and movies, and 30 of them did not like any part of the library and wanted every book, magazine, music, and movie taken out? Even if the 70 others loved what they saw? Do you think it's fair just because some people do not approve, that they get to pick? I do not think it would be fair for just one person to be able to have the right to do that. If something is that offensive to that many people, they should be mature enough to ignore what they see and find what they like. If someone did not like your house and said I don't want to see it should they have to demolish it just like nothing? The world would have never ending chaos if people had too much power to change things. It could only get worse. I have encountered problems between people that do not agree on throwing out or keeping it. One solution could be just move it to a different area where if certain people would like to look at the item they could, otherwise have separate parts of a room that are divided into all ranges. This way, those who are offended don't have to view the material, and those who enjoy it can still access it. If you read this and think to yourself about how many different options you have to get along and not have to worry about offending people you will realize that no certain person should be able to take that one thing that you would like to keep to enjoy and be happy, as compromise and tolerance are more effective than censorship.
610	3587	2	3	Yes, I believe that books should be removed if they have derogatory terms in there such as racial slurs, disrespecting the race of ANY human, etc. But the music part is up in the air because, like, kids hearing songs with cussing, talking about drugs, and all that other bad stuff shouldn't, because, like the way I see it, everybody's gonna learn about it somehow. And when you hear songs repeatedly, you tend to begin to know the words, and if you repeat the words in front of a parent, that's when they can step into the parent role and tell them that the drugs and words are not good. Really, though, if kids pick the book up and are able to read what it says, then I feel like they should know right from wrong by then, and clearly if someone is using bad language, such as the [racial slur] word, they would know that it's wrong, and if they continue to listen to it, that's on them. Ultimately, the responsibility rests on the individual and their understanding of right and wrong, especially as they grow older and encounter such content.
611	3588	2	3	"To the Editor,  I am writing to express my concern about children accessing books with mature content and to suggest these books be removed from shelves accessible to them. My primary concern is that exposure to inappropriate material in books can negatively influence young people. I believe this is a contributing factor to the rise in teenage pregnancies. Removing these ""notey"" books, as I call them, could significantly reduce the rate of young girls becoming pregnant.  I strongly believe that restricting access to mature books by removing them from general shelves and perhaps even enacting a law requiring a certain age to view them would be beneficial. I think children should be @NUM1 or older to access books with mature themes. It's worth trying this approach for a while to see if it works. By limiting exposure to such content, we can reduce the likelihood of teenagers wanting to become parents prematurely.  This is how things should have been handled from the start. We wouldn't be facing so many problems today. The reality is that many young people underestimate the challenges of raising a child. If we hadn't been exposed to things we shouldn't have seen, our society would be better off. Ultimately, limiting access to inappropriate books could lead to fewer teenage pregnancies and a more responsible understanding of parenthood among young people."
612	3589	2	3	Censorship is a growing problem in today's world of literature. Censoring does not always allow the author to thoroughly convey his or her ideas as they were originally intended to. Katherine Paterson says that if we were all allowed to eliminate things that we thought were wrong, then there would be nothing left to be right about. Censoring leads to an ignorant, opinionless, and clueless society. In the novel 'Fahrenheit 451' censorship is one of the main themes of the story. Bradbury portrays the burning of books as the way of ending all controversial opinions. Montag finds that the burning of books has lead the society that he lives in to be ignorant of what is going on around them. The government has tried to rule out all causes of controversial opinions in hope that it would make for a happier society. When in reality, members of the world are not happy and are consistently showing the reader that they do not know how to be happy. Montag decides that he wants to learn, but he does not know how. The brain is a muscle, if it is not exercised correctly, it becomes weak and useless. So when he tries to memorize a part of the Bible, he cannot retain what he has been reading. Such as trying to fill a sieve full of sand, he does not know how to learn.  The members of this novel's society are basically opinionless on what is happening in their world. What they are told on the television is thought of to be factual, and that is what they do all day. In school, kids are being fed fact after fact and are expected to agree with what they are being told with no questioning involved. In a normal society, learning leads to questioning. But for them there is no learning, just accepting. And acceptance leads to contentness, which in the end leads to unhappiness.  The society in 'Fahrenheit 451' proves to be oblivious to everything that is going on in many different ways. To them, death is not a big deal. Clarisse was killed by a speeding car, and Mildred, Montag's wife, was not even shocked to hear it. Another example is when Montag was running from the police, and a car full of rambunctious teenagers attempted to run him over just because they wanted to. At the end of the novel, Montag is walking along the railroad tracks with his new friends and the entire city is blown to dust by bombs dropped by fighter planes. The city had no idea that this was going to happen, they were clueless to the war that was going on around them everyday! A clueless society is a useless society, and in the end they were destroyed.  Censorship lies within the hands of the viewer. Censorship has become such a big problem in the world when there are so many other things people should worry about. Reading about somebody doing drugs will not make a child want to do drugs, it crosses every teenager's mind at least once. But instead of not allowing them to even realize that it is out there, parents should do what they signed up to do, teach your kids right from wrong and hope that you did it well. Thus, censorship ultimately hinders true understanding and the ability to form independent thought, potentially leading to a society mirroring the dystopia depicted in 'Fahrenheit 451'.
613	3590	2	3	No, I don't think that stuff should be removed from the shelves just because someone thinks or takes it to be offensive. Let's say if we had everybody go and say that this book is offensive, or I don't think this movie should be on this shelf because I think it's offensive, then we wouldn't have anything to watch, listen to, or even read. I understand that people have rights and their beliefs, but it doesn't mean they have any say so on what should stay or go.  If we let people do this, then nobody would be able to watch, read, play, or even listen for fun. We use these things for entertainment. Let's say we all know how little children have their imagination and use it to keep themselves entertained, just like older people use books, music, movies, etc., to keep entertained. Well, if we don't have this stuff, we would be lost and won't know what to do without it. Just think of our little kids; if we take their imagination away, they would be lost and hopeless because that's how they learn and grow up.  We use this every day not only to keep us entertained but also to help us learn more about whatever we need to learn about to survive in everyday life. See, in ways, we are not so different from our children at all, really. They use whatever they find or see to keep them entertained and for enjoyment. If people really thought about what they are going to do by removing something from the shelves, then they would regret what they did because now they don't have anything to read, listen to, or even watch. I myself have experienced what it's like to have something like that pulled down from the shelves before, and it's really not cool at all for that to happen. Taking something off the shelves that is a little bit offensive doesn't mean that it should be taken off the shelves.  I think that people who took something off the shelves just because one person thought it was offensive are wrong and should not take something down that maybe other people like. I mean, just look at what the thing is talking about first and see if it's offensive to you or not, and maybe it's something that people could learn from. Taking something down before even reading it yourself is stupid because maybe other people like it, and maybe you'll like it; who knows. I just think that people should really think before they go and take something off the shelves without having a lot of people giving you a bad comment on it before just taking one person's opinion on it, as a broader perspective is crucial before limiting access to content for everyone.
614	3591	2	3	Offensive or NOT? Who can truly say a book, movie, music, or magazine is truly offensive. There are some of the obvious movies that completely make fun of or taunt someone's personal views as a religion or lifestyle but is a book about a wizarding world really that offensive? While growing up I had a friend who was very religious. Her parents would never let her read the Harry Potter books by J.K. Rowling. At the time I didn't understand why she wasn't able to read such fantastic books. Now that I'm older I understand that her parents believe what is in 'The Bible' and nothing more. Make believe and imagination was NOT a suitable thing for their child to read. For many families, though the Harry Potter series is nothing but a different world in which they can set themselves free from the real world. Should a book that many people love and adore be taken off shelves because some families are offended? I personally don't think they should. While my family loves the books and movies some families don't. That is their lifestyle and their opinion. Everyone has an opinion, and if we took out everything in this world that could offend someone we would be left with nothing. Movies would be boring, stories would NOT be interesting, and there would be no music. If our world was based off of the opinions of others and making everyone happy we would NOT have music. Music is a way for someone to release their soul. The different sounds of music are based off generations. My mother's generation was based on Elvis Presley's and mine is of Nicki Minaj, CardiB&Megan Thee Stallion, Drake. So what would really happen if all the offensive materials were taken off the shelves of a public library or say a school. The shelves would be blank. Empty shelves would be a horrible look. Everyone is offended by something. I'm offended by the rape scenes in movies but some people believe in some situations it makes a movie better. My friend's family is offended by the make believe world of Harry Potter, and I believe that some where out in our world there is another world, a wizarding world as a matter of fact. People believe in many different things and like many different things. I've never met one person who is exactly like me, because there is NOT one. I'm an individual like everyone else and if the things I liked were taken off a shelf because someone was offended then my life would be boring because I wouldn't have the things I enjoy. In some cases some offensive things should be taken off shelves but who am I to say it should be, because there is someone out there who believes it should be on the shelves of Barnes and Noble. Ultimately, determining what is offensive is subjective, and while some content may be harmful, restricting access based solely on offense would impoverish our cultural landscape.
615	3592	2	3	As said before there would be no books for anyone to read if everybody removed what they felt was offensive. The libraries would have a very watered down material base and there would be no reason to use this place anymore. Some material is not suitable for young ages there is much from advanced material that can be learned; thus the libraries should separate their books only as they do already. Some material does seem too advanced for others, but these materials are needed to advance academic growth. Some people might think that schools should not read @PERSON1 due to racism in the South. This was true history so there should be no restrictions to that sort of book. If there were those sorts of restrictions then schools would lack much of history's best literature. Just as the movies do for the general population, @CAPS1 is for @NUM1 and up while @NUM2 is for @NUM3 and up. These are good standards that keep the youth from seeing what they are not yet ready for. This concept should be used the same way in these libraries where there seems to be a problem. Yet this is already done in libraries. There would be no reason to break these sections up more than they already are broken. There is the young adult section, adult, and youth. Those are the main categories that most people want separated due to offensive material such as drugs, sex, and alcohol. Much of the media that is public today is censored and that benefits much of the youth, but there is a point where the public needs to realize that sheltering the youth can stunt them academically, so libraries should continue their current methods of categorizing literature.
616	3593	2	3	Books and other things found in libraries can be offensive to some people. This can be because of put-downs on races, offensive comments, the way the author wrote the book, and who it was written towards. Others find some books, music, magazines, and movies offensive because of the terms people use. Some people get offended because they think it's directed toward them, and they take it personally.  Music can be offensive to some people because of the language they use in it. They might look down on it because their children listen to it, and children nowadays say things they hear from music and try to be like the person saying it.  Movies can be offensive because of the language, violence, the way people are treated. A good movie example is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. It has violence, language, and people are treated in a harmful way. But overall the movie teaches you about war and the things they've gone through to get our country to where it is today.  Magazines could be offensive by the words used, such as slang words, cursing words, and violent words. The magazines could have nude pictures of people and most parents do not want their children getting a hold of things like that.  Overall, I think that any of these things could be offensive to some people, and probably are, but they shouldn't take it off the shelf because it's offensive to some. If you'd look at it in a certain way everything in the library could be offensive to someone, and if the case is take everything that's offensive they might have to take everything that's in the library. Therefore, it's not right to take the things off the shelves just because some people do not like it. If it offends you then don't read it or listen to it or even look at it; no one is pressuring you to do it, you do it on your own. So, it's not right to take the things off the shelves just because some people do not like it, as individual choice and access to diverse materials should be respected.
617	3594	2	3	Censorship, as I understand it, is the act of blocking access to certain materials, preventing them from being brought into a specific place or context. The question then becomes: is censorship justifiable? I believe that libraries should have the right to censor certain materials that may be deemed offensive. One reason is to protect young children from accessing inappropriate content like pornography or graphic violence in magazines and movies. Unsupervised access could lead to children sharing such material, potentially causing distress and leading to parents blaming the library for inadequate supervision. Furthermore, libraries should censor movies with gruesome content inappropriate for young viewers, as exposure to such material can be harmful.  Libraries should also be able to censor music containing vulgar language that children might repeat without understanding, potentially leading to uncomfortable situations and parental complaints. Movies with sexually suggestive content should also be censored to protect younger audiences.  The right to censor also extends to books. Certain books, especially those dealing with faith, religion, or gruesome depictions of death, can be offensive to some individuals. Religious beliefs can be a sensitive topic, and libraries can minimize potential offense by removing such books. Similarly, books focusing on death can be disturbing and upsetting to readers, so censoring them can protect sensitive individuals.  In conclusion, libraries should be able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines. Books can contain potentially offensive material related to religion or death. Movies can display pornography and gruesome scenes inappropriate for certain audiences. Magazines might contain images unsuitable for children, and music can contain vulgar language. Therefore, it is fair for libraries to exercise censorship to protect individuals from potentially harmful or offensive content.
618	3595	2	3	Libraries are for children, and adults of all ages. Because all people have different views on life, different beliefs, and different feelings, this makes it hard for libraries to please everyone. There are also different genres that people enjoy reading. Some people enjoy romance and comedy, while others like to read action books or mysteries. Today, libraries have sections dedicated to different genres of materials. They have kids, fiction, informational, and many more. They also have different areas where you can find movies or magazines. But, if there are magazines, books, or movies, that should be viewed only by certain ages, the library should put a warning sign in the areas where those materials are located. On the back of movies there is a rating on how bad the movie is. Why not put a rating on the back of books and magazines? This way people can know what to expect if they read them. This would also help them decide if they even want to read them. Ratings on the back of magazines and books would help distinguish what age is appropriate for them. Once, when i was visiting the library, there was a man in the check out line, right before me. He was returning the book that he had just read and checking out the new one he had already picked out. When it was finally his turn in line he stepped up to the counter and explained to the sweet, old, lady at the front desk, what he had wanted to do with his books. She simply understood that he wanted to check out and return one. As she was checking him out she was making small talk and asked, 'How did you like your book, sir?' He replied 'It wasn't what i expected. It was completely inappropriate. ' As they discussed a little more it turned out that there were tons of curse words throughout the entire book. This is one example of why people don't know what to expect when they read a book. I don't think that libraries should remove materials off the shelves that people have complained about. They should simply do something to let people know what to expect when they read the books, magazines, or movies. Some people may not mind reading a book with a few curse words here and there, but others may find it outrageous. Libraries spend their money to buy these books for the communities. Why take a book off if only a few people find it offensive? No one makes those people read those books, its by their choice. Libraries need to figure out some way to reassure people that they will enjoy what they are reading and not be offended by it, so ratings are a good way to do so.
619	3596	2	3	Should They or Should They Be Censored? What do you think? Music, books, movies and many others have been questioned either about there apperence or what they say. Most people bring up the fact that young children should not be hearing this or haveing to read about it at such a young age, but the children have ideas of their own. In my personal opinion i do not think that they should have to be taken off the shelf or from being sold. What does everyone else think though? Is it a bad idea to keep them up and let the kids learn about it at such a young age or does it help teach them not to be like that? One of the main reasons why I think it should be left alone as is so that the children can read it. They must learn the good from the bad sometime. Its better that children learn at a young age and just trying to keep things from them will make them want it more. Lets use music for example, some music is nothing but screaming and cursing. In real life though alot of kids have to listen to there parents fight and yell. So, why dont they get the choice to listen to it whenever they want to? There are also the bad things to keeping them out on the shelvs. As a mother and also a teenager I feel like as if I should have the choice to do as I please but at the same time there is no way I would ever let my daughter hear or read some of the things I do. That get me to my next point. If you really have a problem with some of the things out there why would you let your childern get it. As being a teegager I would go out and buy a lot of music I shouldnt be listening to, but even if my daughter was 5 there is no way I would let her get it. After all I am the parent right? I have every say in what my daughter can and can't do. So do you over your own child. If other parents have no say in what there child gets just because they don't care, well thats not your problem. There should,however, be age limits on what some are allowed to get parent permission or not. Books with sex scenes and murder should not be allowed into they 12 year old books. Sure, teenagers think they know it all but they still shouldnt be allowed to read something that adults do. Most 5 year olds don't hear about all the drugs, sex, or teen prganacy. As much as they should get information on it, have there parents pick out what book they should read to find out about that kind of thing. I think that in every library that has sexual books and alot of curse words should be put in a specific location that only adults can get to. Video games have to put an age limit on things so why shouldn't books have to have the same exact thing? The only reason they haven't done anything so far is beacuse not enought parents care.This is your chance to get up and show them that you want to make a change, that you won't let your kids hear about things without your knowing. This brings me to my conclusion. Where are the parents out there? Why arn't you stepping in and showing people the right way to live? Make your nearest library have age limits on what the little young ones can read. See if the books you are letting your son/daughter check out are age worthy or not. Last but not least try to talk your libraien into makeing groups of books. Some for the youngre kids some for the older. Woulnt kill for you to put your say in and try to get this kind of thing under control and not just removed. Why remove other people's interests when you can just put an age limit on it and not let your child get a hold of it. Today is the day!!Make a say!! By taking action and engaging in the conversation, parents can help shape a more responsible and age-appropriate media environment for their children.
620	3597	2	3	Some people think that offensive books should be off the selves, but some other people think that this should not be allowed. I do not believe that certain materials (books, movies, and magazines) should be removed. If we take every book off the self then we would not have any book to read. If we start taking offensive books off the self then everybody coming in would be taking books off the self. Then within two days there would be no books left. If we do not have any books then our eyes would be bad from lack of reading. We should not take books off the selves because some people like to read. If people do not like the books in the library then they should not go to the library to get books. This is why people should not take offensive books off the selves; doing so would limit access to reading material and, in turn, this will supposedly make peoples eyes so bad that they would not see good at all.
621	3598	2	3	Reading is a joy to some and a pain to others. Do I think objects in the library with offensive details should be cleaned up or taken off the shelves? There are some things that could be censored, and others that wouldn't be worth using if it was censored. However, yes I do believe that there are items in the library that could be censored. I am going to tell you why they should be censored, and what should be censored. The types of items in the library that shouldn't be cleaned up, a perfect example of those items are historical documentaries or historical books because they have no other way to get the information needed across to the reader or viewer in an accurate way. There are other types of library items that could be censored, like some magazines and movies that show uncensored scenes or pages that are not needed to make a point, if there even is a point to get across. I think a movie, book, or a magazine should only be uncensored if it is essential to getting a point across. If there are uncensored items not getting a point across then they have no business being in the library because they are only causing harm. As people can see in a library there are circumstances where a book, movie, or magazine uncensored is very useful in getting information to an audience. There are more circumstances where a library item does not need uncensored details because it is just offensive and not adding to the item's main idea. If you ask me if I think censorship is important in libraries than I would have to say yes and no, because it depends on the item. I just gave you some reasons why I would say that. The next time you are in the library looking for a book ask yourself one question: is it too offensive to be important? If it is more offensive than important, it should not be in the library.
622	3599	2	3	Have you ever imagined going to the library and getting a magazine from the shelf, only to find it offensive and feel helpless? Well, now you can speak up! Katherine Paterson and I went to a library together, and we picked out magazines from the shelves that contained a lot of offensive material we didn't like. We went to the lady at the front desk, and she didn't even know these magazines were there. She got really mad and went back to the shelves and found a lot of magazines with offensive writing, pictures, and even comments. We gathered all of the magazines and threw them away. In my opinion, offensive things like movies, music, and magazines should be removed. They should be removed because they are a bad influence on the youth, giving them harmful ideas that they might act on later, whether by saying offensive things in public or acting out in their homes. Removing such content is crucial because it's leading many people into trouble, causing them to emulate what they see. This particularly affects kids, who are becoming more violent toward their schoolmates, friends, and even family members. We encounter these offensive materials everywhere, and they are easily accessible. For example, movies increasingly feature nudity. Parents need to be more involved, as they often purchase these materials and leave them accessible to their children. We have to be more careful about what we buy or read because it could be offensive, and our kids might then misinterpret it. So, next time you buy something or go somewhere and find something offensive, talk to the manager or supervisor about removing it. That's why I believe offensive material should be removed to protect our youth and foster a more respectful society.
623	3600	2	3	Parents telling their kids what they are allowed to read at certain ages is a common idea, but I disagree with it. I really think that anyone should be able to read the kind of books that they like. The library is where they get the books from, and just because a parent does not want their child to read a certain book doesn't mean that the book shouldn't be there for others. I think that parents need to tell their children *why* they do not want them to read a book.  If the parents explain, kids will understand why it is not good for them at that particular time. These types of books are what older people like and they can be very interesting to many readers. I think if people understand what the book talks about and if it does not bother them, then they are old enough for it. Also, the young kids that should not be reading these books should have an adult or guardian with them, therefore they can stop the kid from reading something that is not appropriate for them.  Something else that will bother many people is them not being able to get a book just because some parents do not like it. This is taking a right away from readers, and we should not have to go buy the book and only read it once. If these books are so horrible then why would people still be writing them and publishing them? So, if they have not bothered people that bad yet then there is no reason for people to not like it now. People should be able to do what they enjoy and not have that taken from them unfairly.  This is my opinion of the statement. Many people may not agree, but I just tried to make people see my point of view on this topic. Then everyone can help stop people taking things away from the community that makes them happy and provides opportunities for personal growth. Also, I hope people can still have their rights and not let a small number of people take them away, so we can all continue to enjoy the freedom of reading.
624	3601	2	3	Television, news, drama, life, and controversy. These are just a few of the things books are written about. Some subjects are considered to be vulgar and innappropriate for young audiences. Many people believe that their children have a right to learn about all the things books can offer, but is that really such a good thing? Books have been an important tool for students for a long time. However, not all books should be considered appropriate for all audiences. Stories about knights and princesses are great for young people, but other stories about the darker sides of life are normally kept away from the hands of children. Books are censored for all sorts of reasons. Some of these reasons are frivelous and should not keep a book from reaching it's full potential. The truth is that there is a line that should not be crossed, and some books cross this line, and are banned. Great. However, some books do not 'cross the line' and are banned regardless. Honestly, careful consideration must be taken before the decision is made to ban a book or to leave it on shelves. If a book is written with only minor obscenities by a recognized author, and it is banned, then the author faces no serious pressure as the banning will be well known and consumers will still purchase the book just for a chance to read it. However, if an author who is relatively unknown writes a well-put-together piece that contains a few spots where the author may have made a somewhat vulgar reference, and the book is banned, the author is in serious trouble. This author can no longer have the luxury of having their book in libraries so that their work can be recognized. Banning books is hindering authors everywhere from being able to make a name for themselves. Books that are especially vulgar should definitely be banned. No child should be reading a book that has an intended audience of purely adults. Children should be protected from such material, and book banning provides this service. If a child has a burning desire to read a book, they can simply ask their parents to buy it for them, assuming the parents agree that filthy books should be okay for children to read. If a book can provide good discussion in a classroom setting, and is mostly 'clean', then it should certainly be available for everyone. Just because a book contains a few areas where innappropriate references are made doesn't mean that students shouldn't be able to read the book. If the learning material a book offers 'outweighs' the negative effects the book may have on a student, then the book should be available for students to read. However, because one cannot effectively compare knowledge and harmful effects, this is a difficult statement to make. Honestly, it is too difficult to say whether small problems in a book should be considered vulgar enough to ban a book. Many books should not be as available as others, but using a new system to find which books to limit would be too difficult, and keeping the current one would make more sense than any other alternatives. In the end, a system that caters to the most sheltering of parents is the best one. Such a system, while perhaps not perfect, errs on the side of caution and protects the innocence of children, which is a worthwhile goal.
625	3602	2	3	I believe there should not be censorship in libraries, because if someone needs to read a book about something and the library does not have it because they do not believe or like what the book has to say, it prevents the reader from accessing important information. The very first reason I believe there should not be any censorship in libraries is because a lot of students go there to study for papers. So if the library does not have the book that a student is looking for, the library is failing its main purpose of providing resources for education. The second reason is that if the person in charge of the library does not like a book, that does not mean he or she should prevent others from reading it; books are meant for anyone and everyone to read and form their own opinions. Then the third is that a library is meant to have books so people can read them, so if the owner takes a book out and someone needs that specific book and cannot get the information they need, the library is failing its main purpose of providing information. The fourth reason is that a lot of people read books to learn about something, and just because he or she does not like what the book has to say does not give them the right to take the book away from those who might want to learn from it. These are the main reasons I think libraries should not have censorship. The owner of the library should have any book possible and should not choose to not put a book in it because he or she does not like what the book says, ensuring everyone has access to a wide range of perspectives.
626	3603	2	3	I am neutral on this subject because it does not matter to me whether they put new books, movies, music cds, or magazines on their shelves or if they take them off. Also it does not matter to me if I have to pay for the things that I check out from the library. Also it does not matter at all if I had to pay a late fee for the books that I checked out from the library. Also I do not care about any noises that go on in the library. Also it does not matter to me what kind of books they have in the library, be they fiction or nonfiction. Also it would not matter to me how the library is run, whether efficiently or inefficiently. Also I would not care if I had to be quiet in the library it would not matter to me. Also I would not care how long that I would stay in the library. Also it would not matter to me if I walked or drove or rode my bike to the library. Also I would not care if the policy in the library was not the right way to run it. Also if I got kicked out of the library I would just go to another one. Finally, it would not matter to me if I got ten books or movies from the library I would not care, as the library and its contents simply hold no significance for me.
627	3604	2	3	I think that the books sould not be removed because people know what they are reading and if they dont like the book they sould leave it. There is no reson that the people would whant to remove any book for any reson because alot of people like different kinds of books. If they would remove any books they would be alot of people mad because those people mighit of really liked that book and wanted someone else to read it. That book might of also been in there family for a really long time and they want everyone in there family to enjoy that book. Also, different people have different tastes, and a book that one person dislikes might be another person's favorite.  It would also not be good to remove a book because if they remove a book they have to get more books and that would cost more money to get more books it will also waste more papper. Buying new books requires resources, and keeping existing ones saves on costs.  Another reson that it would not be a good idea is that if you get another book replace the old one the people might not like the new book and the place where they have the book at will lose money and will not be good for them. If the new book is unpopular, it could lead to financial losses.  So thays what I think would be my opinion about removeing a book it would not turn out very good and the book store will lose alot of money because they got rid of a good book and broght back a reallty bad book. Keeping a diverse selection of books is better for everyone involved, from readers to bookstores.
628	3605	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a big problem in today's society, many people get angry at libraries and markets because of the items that they have on display for the common consumer. If the consumer walks into a library and is looking for a book to read. What if they come accross a book from the early 1900's? In these times there were lots of words used that are 'harmful' to our people today, but what most people dont understand is that, these words that are harmful had different meanings in that time in history. So when someone picks up a book and finds harmful or un-appropriate words or phrases in them, they instantly get the wrong idea about the book. And then, this small group of people who dont like this piece of literature, go agains the vast majority of people who really do understand the literature, and the feeling and dialect of the book. That is where i am going to explain to this small group of people, a few details that they should keep in mind when trying to rip a book off of the shelf and throwing it away. When someone goes into a store or library and starts to look for a book, they may come accross a piece of literature that they dont completely agree with. When this person comes across this piece of literature, all they have to do is put it back on the shelf and move on. Nobody is forcing that person to read this book, so why make a big deal about it? Because most people who make a big deal about some of the word usage in a book, dont quite understand the dialect of the book, or the time period the book was written in. If you do not understand the literature completely, then i ask that these people do not make a big scene out of it, and that they dont try to revoke the author's rights to have that piece of literature on the shelf. Authors have just as many rights as we do. If they write literature. A poem, novel, or even a short story, these authors have the right to have it published and put on the shelf. So why would we not have the same rights? If we dont agree with some of the literature that are being placed in our society's schools, stores, and homes. Then we can write a novel, newspaper article, or even make a website about your topic. You can make web polls much more. This is a more indirect approach to removing a piece of literature. If you want to have a better chance of this book or novel to be removed from the shelves, you can use a poll or have people vote, to recieve other people's oppinions, and use these in your argument. If you have more than one oppinion on a subject, you may have a more likely chance of winning your argument. And this will cause a lot less chaos and attention to be drawn to yourself and others around you. Another reason why i dont think that people should be able to choose what is on the shelves of libraries everywhere. I do not think that anybody from anywhere shoudl be able to come into a library and take a piece of literature off of the shelves forever. Because, in todays society, we have researchers going all of the time, and we have so many people working on different theories and laws. So if we take one important book off of the shelf, maybe a book written in the 1800's about evolution. And we get rid of all of these books, what will happen when we really need that information? These scientists may need that piece of literature to test a theory, and if that piece of literature is expelled from the shelves, then we could miss out on a large variety of major information that could help out someone in the future. So the more information we take off of the shelves, the less we will have in the future to help us will our problems. So, now that i have told you all of my opinions on this subject, i hope that you will have a better view on the cencorship of libraries everywhere, and you can see the importance of retaining diverse perspectives. And that maybe someday all books and pieces of literature will be able to remain on the shelves, being endlessly read by consumers.
629	3606	2	3	Curse words, alcohol, drugs, pornographic pictures. These are all things you would not like your children to use, see, or do. They are out in the world and and there is nothing that you can do to stop it. People do drugs and drink everyday, but just because someone sees you doing it doesnt mean they will too. People should not be shielded from the real aspects of life. When shielded as a child they would not know what do to if the chances came to them to do drugs or drink. They might not even know what the right or wrong thing to do is. Kids to a certain age deserve to know whats going to happen in the real world when they grow up and start a life. It won't happen to everyone but they need to know these things.  It is important for parents to let their children know what is right or what is wrong. As an adolesent, they are very vulnerable to all the bad stuff that life can bring. Seeing these things in books, movies, magazines and etc. will effect their life in some way. It is their job to show them the right path and guide them appropriately.  A thing that helps these parents are restrictions on the stuff that you are able to get your hands on. On movies there are age restrictions that inable people at a certian age to be able to watch and people that are within those guidelines to have access. With other materials like books, music, and magazines, there is no way to deny access to people to see or read them. Parents just need to be observent to their children and see what they do, offering guidance where needed.  Censorship is normally a bad thing, but in others it could help. For people that are more vulnerable to those situations or seeing those things, it could greatly help with some people and show them that it is not right. As much as people should be open and be able have access to this information, it is also important that other people did not see it. It is still an open debate, but, in opinion, censorship should not be done, as it infringes on personal freedom. Everyone had their own right to get and see the things they want, and it is up to them to decide what is appropriate for their lives.
630	3607	2	3	In libraries and bookstores worldwide books are written and published with subject matter ranging from odd or inappropriate, to serious or violent. These books are written to target emotions in the reader that spark excitement and humor, horror and empathy among many others. However, though these books are made for a specific purpose, it is sometimes unclear as to how the book is appropriate for the eyes of a young reader, or even a mature reader. These books appear unappealing and offensive. However, though they don't appeal to you as a reader, how could this book be censored without the unanimous disapproval of everyone? Censorship of these books is unjust because of the right of free speech and press, because all subjects are deserving of being written, and most importantly because target audiences deserve books written in their interest regardless of their approval. The first reason that their should be no censorship of novels and works of literature is because writers deserve the freedoms of speech and press. They are aloud to voice their own opinions and write about the subject matter that they are most interested in. Though many times they have used subject matter that is highly provocative or inappropriate, they still have the capacity and the legal ability to write about what they wish. To stop them from writing their own opinionated stories is similar to the censorship of books in nazi Germany. Millions of books were burned and hundreds, if not thousands of writers were executed for conveying opinions in their work that conflicted with the ideas of their government. Even though there are books not written for all ages they are still deserving of a reader. The next reason that books should not have censorship is because new ideas cover topics that have never been discussed. Books and stories are meant to push the mark of what has been written and what can be written. The variety of literature is the reason why it is so popular. For thousands of years, written text has been a way to understand and connect with cultures and people through written language. And though stories may not be written in a manner that would be appropriate for a child, it doesn't mean that the story shouldn't be written or read. Its use should simply be monitored so that only those capable of accepting or understanding its message are capable of reading it. Lastly, censorship is simply unjust because without it there is a better chance to discuss and attempt to describe stories that target a vast crowd of people. Though the materials found in a story may be horrific to a parent, it may be a preferred form of literature for a different group of people. And to limit the literary subjects that people prefer could be parallelled with limiting a person's voice of opinion. It simply isn't reasonable to allow only a single category of work, with only a few varieties of messages, for only a select group of people. Variety is what seperates a person's opinions, and makes their being different than another's. Therefore, censorship of literature should not be enforced. Writing topics should be open to all people, because whether they are offensive or not they convey a purpose. And because writers have the right to illustrate their points through a literal medium, there should never be a limit on these rights, allowing diverse voices and perspectives to enrich the literary landscape. That is why censorship should never be able to remove a piece of literature from any shelf.
631	3608	2	3	Well do you think that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all music you listen to is offensive. Who can say what is offensive to everyone? Who can tell you what you think is offensive or not? How can you be your own person if people are making desisions for you about the books you read, the movies you watch, and the music you listen to? I'm going to tell you about why I think that no certain materials such as books, movie, music, magazines, ect., should be taken off library selves because someone finds them offensive. Who can be the ultimate decision maker in deciding if something is offensive to everyone? Everyone has their own meaning of offensive. Everyone thinks that different things are offensive to them. How can you say that one thing is offensive to one person and is also offensive to another person?. I think if one person thinks that something is offensive to them that is ok, that is their own opioion, but maybe the next person that walks by and see's the so call offensive material will love it. You should not be able to make someone elses decisions for them if they want to read an offensive book, watch an offensive movie, and or listen to offensive music that is their chose not someone elses to make for them. If every peson took a book off the selves that they thought to be offensive then we would not longer have any books on the selves. Some people think that certain music, books, and movies are offensive and other people think that the books, music, and movies are cool and interesting so what do you do then? I have learned over the years that not every person will agree with your opinions on everything and you won't agree with them but yet you both still have your own opinions. You both are allowed to decide what you do and dont like. You both get to choose what books you read, what movies you watch, and what music you listen to. So why should we let anyone stop us from being ourselves? You can never say that anyone thing is offensive to everyone because no one person can be everyone. You can't talk for someone else because everyone has a voice for themselves. So do you think that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all the music you listen to is offensive? well you @MONTH1 not but someone else somewhere is trying to take that out of the libraries because they have a negative opinion about it but is that fair? Ultimately, allowing individuals to choose what they consume fosters a society where diverse perspectives can coexist, and where we are free to think for ourselves.
632	3609	2	3	Imagine your child or someone that is very close to you. He's only around @NUM1 years old, just starting to learn how to be an adult and take on responsibilities. He wants to try new things. He listens to his friends talking about drinking alcohol and how much fun it is. He thinks it sounds amazing to drink. He doesn't know something is bad about it or not. No one ever told him. So he starts to drink and later died of alcohol poisoning. Now, you don't want this to ever happen to someone who is very close to you. If people are too scared to talk about the bad things in life, like sex, drugs, etc., then they should make books and movies to show how bad these things are. There should not be censorship in libraries. Some of you @MONTH1 say 'well they're too young, they can't handle these things yet.' @CAPS1, your opinion should consider their maturity level; also, they can learn from other people's mistakes, and it would educate people.  How do you tell someone's maturity level? There are many ways to tell. If you talk to someone about sex and they start to laugh and make jokes, then they're not very mature. But, you can't associate that every @NUM2-year-old is immature. Many people @MONTH1 take this as a serious thing. Others @MONTH1 may not, but they still will be able to see them in their own way. Putting censorship in libraries would not be a good idea.  Many topics in books, movies, music, magazines, etc., @MONTH1 have inappropriate things in them, like sex, drugs, drinking, bad language. Should all these things be taken out of libraries and off the shelves? @CAPS1 a hard question to answer. But, what you can answer from that is it would allow people to learn from their mistakes. If there's a movie and a guy is doing drugs and later dies, people could assume that drugs kill you. But, what about the other things? It's hard to show how it's bad to say an offensive word to someone that they heard on the radio. But, when they hear that word or read about something or watch, they can ask about it, and we can say that saying those things or doing them can be offensive.  Now, can you educate someone from letting the person listen, read, or watch about something offensive, etc.? It depends on the person. But, you can educate someone about the subject matter, no matter how offensive the topic is. We should teach people about them. If we don't, it's bound to repeat itself. Say if we censor the Holocaust because of how horrifying it was. No one would know about it, and we would most likely repeat the Holocaust. Censoring certain things in a library would not be that good of an idea.  Certain people can handle talking about certain subjects. It's not always a good thing to censor offensive subjects. We need to teach people about these things to educate them, and also so they can learn what has been done and not repeat it; also, some people can handle these materials, they just need to have a high maturity level. These are some reasons why there should not be censorship in libraries and other places, as education and learning from the mistakes of the past are crucial for a well-informed and responsible society.
633	3610	2	3	Offensive books do belong in the library, just in a completely different area, away from the children. If we all chose a book that we didn't want in the library, there would be none left. So, since everyone has a different opinion about what is offensvie and what isn't, who's to say what can and can't be in the library? When I was little, my grandma would take me to the library almost every Saturday. I noticed that she tried to keep me from getting certain books and my parents did the same thing, but they had different opinions on what was okay for me to read and what wasn't. Grandma wanted me to get religious books and parents were okay with that and things like 'Clifford the Big Red Dog', and 'Amelia Bedelia'. Even at home, everyone's opinion is very different. For instance, when it comes to music at my house; my parents like country, my sister likes metal, my brother likes alternative, my uncle likes rock, and I like a combonation of all of it. That just does to show how different people have different opinions; some more strict than others, some more lenient. If we relied on peoples' opinions to keep our librarys free of offense, there would be nothing in it, illustrating how subjective offense truly is and why a balanced approach is necessary.
634	3611	2	3	If you take any of these books off the shelves that would be like taking away some of our childhood. That wouldn't be the nicest thing to do. Even if you did take some of them off then what would we show our children when they ask what was your favorite book as a kid? We will have to tell them that the library doesn't have those books anymore; they had to make room for other books. So if you would please understand we got to read all of our parents favorite childhood books. I mean how would you feel if you couldn't share that with your kids? I would be upset because my parents told me and I went out and got them from the library and I loved them too. So please if you can leave the books alone; keeping these beloved stories available ensures future generations can experience the same joy and connection to their family history through literature.
635	3612	2	3	What is a library? A library is a place you go to that has books, movies, music, magazines, etc. With these things a person can do research or use for entertainment. Should there be censorship in libraries? In my opinion there should be very little censorship in a library. If there was a complaint about being offended by something in the library and it was removed from the shelf, there would be nothing left to use in the library. Many people like to go to the library to relax and have some good peace and quiet time and while there at the library they let their minds flow, imaginate, and dream. They don't worry about being offended by a single book. However censorship in a library can be a good thing if used delicately. For example, moving grown up books to a section where children will not read them and have nightmares about a picture they saw in it. What I'm trying to say is have censorship in the library, but at a very low standard. If a library had high censorship and everything was taken off the shelf what is the point of going to the library, it would be an empty room. If someone is offended by something in the library, depending on how severe they where offended take the appropiate measures. For instance if something just offended someone unintentionaly leave it where it is, but if something offends someone intentionaly by their race, ethnicity or something like that, it would then be appropriate to take it off the shelf. Having low censorship in libraries would be good because there would be a good quantity of stuff for you to do your research on and there would be more topics to choose from to let your imagination soar, while at the same time you would not have to worry about being severely offended, creating a balance between access and sensitivity.
636	3613	2	3	Censorship in Libraries To remove something a person dislikes off of a shelf, is assuming other peoples opinions don't count. It really has to depend on what the product is, like a book, magazine, music album, or a movie. Usually in any store, there are certain departments for each product. In these separate departments, the product is always categorized, not from what people like, but by genre or age differences. If a person was to linger away from their section in that department and go to another part, their taste in their product will seem too different to like.  A local library will have many books to read and to choose from. There are baby books, kids sections, teenage and adults sections as well. The teenage section is for me! Although I used to always be in the kids section not that long ago, those books should now be removed because I have no use for them or wouldn't be interested in picking another one up, yet that is just me. However the generation under me will soon love them. Just because one person dislikes something, doesn't mean it should be thrown out for everyone else.  Music is a different story. Some people like country and some people like alternative. In libraries they have all types of music albums that a person can listen to, before they rent it out. When I listen to one album to see if I like it and find out that I don't, I simply put it back on the shelf and try another one. The librarian doesn't throw it away because of my opinion, because to someone else it would be the sweetest music to their ears.  Anyone can watch any type of movie in my opinion. Yet not all parents allow their twelve year old to watch a rated R movie. For them, it's only G movies. This is how I grew up. Now that I am allowed to watch whatever my heart desires, i've noticed that movies are based on maturity levels. In libraries, some movies aren't allowed to be rented by a younger person, but it doesn't mean they should be tossed out. When they are older they might actually like them.  Overall a person's opinion will be the most important one to them, and other opinions won't matter as much. Products in a library are for anyone to view, not to judge; if absolutely everyone did judge the products, there wouldn't be any left, highlighting the importance of diverse perspectives and access.
637	3614	2	3	I believe that it is unfair to ban any sort of materials from the library. It simply isn't right to withhold information from your children. Any information that they might read or hear is something that they are going to find out sooner or later anyway. Wouldn't you much rather your children find out from reading it in a book or magazine or hearing it in a movie or CD? Then they can ask parents any questions that they might have about things they have read and heard instead of hearing it from a teenager in the hall or talking to a friend about it and being misguided and given the wrong information. If your child is to read about sex or an affair in a magazine wouldn't you like to know? Would you want them to ask you questions about it so that they understand the difference between right and wrong? Wouldn't it be much easier to know that your child is educated on certain things so that they know when things are false and they're not confused or worried about something small? Any of the things that they read in a magazine or see in a movie are things that they could easily look up on the internet. On the internet there are more graphic photos, and some websites give false information on subjects. Your child's curiosity could take them to inappropriate websites. When I was a child and I was curious, my parents sheltered me from certain things. I found out what kinds of things they were trying to hide from me while I was only in second grade when high schoolers on my bus told me all about sex, showed me pictures and told me things that I would have much rather heard about in class or read. I felt like I couldn't talk to my parents about these things. I mean what would you do if your second grader came home from school and started talking to you about the kinds of things that they had heard on the bus? What if the high schoolers had been lying to me, I would feel stupid for saying anything about it because my parents wouldn't have understood what I was talking about. What I'm saying is that I understand that there are some things that a child should never be allowed to read, see, or hear. It isn't fair to them that they don't get the opportunity themselves to learn about it and ask questions. Besides, isn't it your fault in all reality if they get their hands on something inappropriate for their age because they aren't getting the proper supervision? If you feel that they are reading, listening, or watching something that you feel is inappropriate, ask questions. Explain things to them when they ask you a question. Don't beat around the bush. Make sure that they know the difference between good and bad, right and wrong. It truly is not fair to take these things away from them when they don't even know why they are not allowed to look at it, so open communication and parental guidance are vital components of navigating a child's access to information.
638	3615	2	3	No because all people like to read different books. Some of the books that people want taken off bookshelves are considered to be part of history. Books help people advance in their reading skills and also help them find new things out. When I was in middle school I always liked to read @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 books. When I asked the librarian if they had any of their books they said no. They thought that kids in middle school shouldn't be reading books with cuss words in them and violence. I don't think it should matter what kids read because you can't make a kid read something that he's not interested in because everybody is different; all people like different types of books. There's all kinds of books like for example there's mystery books, fiction books, non-fiction books, historical books, etc. The books you use in classrooms are considered books but they're not books you read everyday for enjoyment. I think parents should take their kids to the public library to get a book. When I was in elementary and through junior high we had to take reading tests on the computer. In seventh and eighth grade we had to sit around the room and take a book and read it for part of the hour. We also had a challenge in middle school to see which school could read the most. That was part of our grade in our English class. It was never a problem for me because I loved to read. Now there are some books that libraries should take off the shelves. For example, any book that involves nudity or lots of violence. Now that's just for kids that are under the age of thirteen. Now there isn't that many books out there for little kids to read. There's more adult books than little kids books. All I have to say is that watch what your kids read. Don't keep them from reading books because that will affect them later on in life. If they don't like to read persuade them to try it. I also think that more kids would read if they saw their relatives reading too, setting a positive example. Just remember kids and adults of all ages reading is a good thing no matter what you decide to read, fostering knowledge and imagination.
639	3616	2	3	"In this persuasive essay, I will argue why offensive material should not be banned from library shelves. My first main point is that some material considered offensive by some is not by others, and removing it harms those who wish to access it. Taking books and movies off the shelves prevents some kids from experiencing material that could help them in the future. Secondly, if we remove all potentially offensive material, we would be left with very little, like ""Bambi"" and ""Scooby-Doo,"" because almost everything offends someone. I personally haven't found anything offensive in libraries. Moreover, if we ban offensive material, we might as well close libraries altogether, as there would only be a handful of items left due to the vast range of potential offenses found in books, movies, and CDs. People hear offensive language daily, at school or at home, making the language and actions in movies less shocking than real-life occurrences. I view movies and books as just that—movies and books. Scary movies are not real, and neither are some books. While movies may contain sex and other inappropriate content, age restrictions already exist to address this. To summarize, we should not remove anything from library shelves because it harms others and is unnecessary. We should keep all material in libraries to provide diverse perspectives and resources for everyone."
640	3617	2	3	"When I walk into a library to look for a book, I would love to do so without seeing inappropriate books, movies, or magazines. When I see that, I think, ""What if a child saw this?"" I would like a library for my child to visit without me worrying about the things they could see. To fix this problem, the libraries could do a number of things. First off, the libraries could censor what they put out on the selves. By putting the adult books section by the check out place, an employee at the library could easily find any small children wandering into that section. If that solution does not work, then try and rate the sections like we rate movies. Put G books and movies together, PG-13 books and movies together, R-rated books and movies together, and so on. One time, when I took my baby brother to the library, he decided to bring me an adult book with a nude woman on the cover and asked if he could check it out. I was shocked and embarrassed. I did not think that that kind of thing would happen at a public library, but it did. I believe that everyone should have the option of finding the book or movie of their choice. So I do not wish to have any inappropriate books or movies removed, but placed in better order so that children are not going to see that kind of stuff, ensuring a more comfortable and appropriate environment for all library visitors."
641	3618	2	3	Should the library be censored on the books it has on the shelves? I think it should be. There are many offensive books and things on the shelves. I wouldn't want my kid or anybody else's kid reading offensive books. So let's get rid of all the bad stuff or at least filter it all. I believe any book, movie, and magazine that has a lot of profanity or bad pictures in them should be removed or not be able to be checked out to a certain age. If they want to keep the books on the shelves they should make it where you have to be in high school and have a permission slip to get the books. Removing the books and things completely might cause too much trouble, so we should definitely make sure the kid is a certain age and has permission.  I would not want my 8 year old kid reading a book with bad language in it. Kids catch on to that stuff and they will start talking like that and it would not be a good thing. There is a lot going on in society now a days that badly influences children. They do not need to read about how guys rob places and are criminals. I think that's why we have so much of a problem today because everyone sees it at a young age and they want to be like that when they get older, but that is a very bad thing. They do not need books and movies that make it worse on them and make them think bad things are good. If we do not filter what they do at a young age they will end up being hellions and out of control because they will think just because someone in a book or movie did it that it's ok for them to do it, but it's not.  I would not want a young kid to read bad things. I say let's put an age limit on them and make our society better and our kids to become better adults later on in their life. We need to filter out the bad and put new in for our younger kids. If we don't, who knows how they'll grow up to be; the world could go to hell if we don't stop the kids from learning bad things. So let's get the filtering started and save the world and our kids future, ensuring they are not exposed to inappropriate content that could negatively shape their development.
642	3619	2	3	Thoughts of @CAPS1 literature: I feel as though offensive literary pieces should be able to be taken from libraries. If a piece of literature is particularly offensive; the piece should not be displayed. From my own experience, controversy is the reason that books are stricken from libraries. All of my experience, observations, and reading have told me one thing: pieces of literature are taken away because of their offensiveness. From the experience that I have had with books that cause controversy, I have noticed myself not liking the book. I believe that is the reason people do not like certain books in libraries. Coming from someone who does not particularly like reading, I feel as though reading something that offends me puts me in a state of mind as though I would not like to read any longer. All of my experiences seem to point to not reading books that cause distress or controversy. Of all that I have observed, I have found similar things as my experiences. I have seen people, classmates in particular, that do not desire to read because they feel that a novel has offended them. Though my observations this @MONTH1 seem one-sided, I truly have observed more lack of reading due to controversy than the increasing of reading due to controversy. All of my observations seem to point to supporting the revocation of 'banned books'. The piece that I have noticed most prominent to this topic that I have read would most definitely be @CAPS2 @NUM1. In said novel society has outlawed all books. The story seems to heavily favor those who wish to read controversial novels, though we can take something from reading this book. The reading of this novel can be interpreted to favor my argument, as people lived happily without controversial books. Granted not all people did, but that is because of certain variables. From stories, such as the three little pigs and the big bad wolf, we can understand how poorly the concept of controversiality is drawn. For instance, I was mortified hearing that the first time. I have never had the interest of hearing it again, as I felt that the story is not politically correct. Pieces of literature are taken away because of their offensive properties. If someone has no interest in reading a book because of the thoughts maintained inside of the text, the book must be stripped from the public, as it would only make sense to try to keep the peace. I for one support the cause to remove books from public places due to controversiality, as their removal can foster a more comfortable and inclusive reading environment.
643	3620	2	3	People today always seem like they are trying to find something offensive. The problem with the @ORGANIZATION1 is that it always feels like it needs to appease these people. The truth is that when you have as many people as there is in a country, there are going to be many different ideas, thoughts, likes, and dislikes. Libraries are places of knowledge. They keep many different books, magazines, and movies there, so that people with all different tastes can enjoy the library. Most people, with books, figure out early what genre of books, which authors, and how long of books they like. So books are usually very hard to offend people, because most people can usually tell right away if they like the book or not. Magazines are like books in away. People know what they want. With magazines though, people usually just flip through the pages, and skim through articles. They will keep skimming through the magazine, until they find that perfect article they want to read. Usually after that, they are done with the magazine. Music has been around almost as long as mankind has been around. There is something about music that soothes the human body. Music is one of those things that is constantly changing with time. Before instruments, music was just purely voice, but as the centuries went on, music became more advanced. Now it would be nice if there was just one type of music that everybody liked, but there isn't. There are so many types of genres of music, that it would be hard to find a person in this world that liked every type of music. There are people who hate change. Likewise they don't like to change there favorite music types. But if people changed with time, then there would really only be a few types of music. But since there are many types of music, there is always going to be someone out there in the world that doesn't think that song shouldn't be played. Just in the last century movies have came along way in advancement. Movies use to be simple, they would have a simple plot, and everyone loved it. But there are so many people who love to see technology advance, that they want movies to change. Movies today are all about special effects, love, sex, alcohol, parties, fighting, and the list could go on and on. Directors try to make the best movie possible, so its almost like they try to put just enough of one thing to keep the audience into the movie. But if they go overboard on a subject, that is when at least one person has a red flag go up in their head and think that is offensive. Movies are suppose to be entertaining, not something people should get offended by. Movies are good about it though. They have created a rating system to try give the audience a fair warning heads up, so that the audience knows what to suspect in the movie. It doesn't matter what it is, book, magazine, music or movie, there is always going to be someone who doesn't like it or is just offended by it. There is nothing to do about that, and it's not a bad thing; it just simply means everyone in this world is not the same. So I think we can all come up with the conclusion that: just because one person doesn't like something, doesn't mean the next person will.
644	3621	2	3	I don't think books should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. If a book contains remotely offensive content towards children, it should be placed in an adults-only section. Most libraries have sections for different age groups. If a book is racially unacceptable, it should be in the adult section, away from children. When a book's offensiveness is questioned, we should review how someone might comprehend the story and their potential reaction. There are many genres of books, music, magazines, and more, so there's always a place for a book. Often, the language is the issue. For example, in schools, there's debate about reading 'Of Mice and Men' because of the 'n-word.' It's a harsh word, but it fits the story's setting and background. When unsure about a book's acceptability, consider the story and whether the word is necessary. Often, the unacceptable aspects work with the narrative. If one book is questioned, shouldn't all books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be questioned? If something is disallowed for one item, it shouldn't be allowed for another. Appropriateness depends on the audience. I've read books with words that don't bother me, but others might dislike them. Some parents don't want their kids hearing foul language or inappropriate music. It depends on who reads the book or magazine, and who listens to the music. Katherine Paterson makes a good point that removing books could lead to empty shelves. Just because something has a bad word or phrase doesn't mean it should be taken away from people's enjoyment, as context and individual sensitivity play significant roles in how content is received.
645	3622	2	3	If you have been a child with parents who cared, then you have heard them say, 'No you can't play that game, you can't listen to that music, or you can not watch that movie.' YOU asked why you were not allowed the same answer was always givin, 'You're not old enough.' If you ever had the courage to ask why again they would most likely have said, 'FINE if I wanted you to know then I would allow you to find out for yourself!', and that didn't get you anywhere now did it? Now I would like for you to think back on those things you were not allowed to do, and how now that you are old enough you can do those things. How would it change things if those movies, VIDEO GAMES, or games had been removed from the shelves before you had the chance to get to them? What would you and your friends have done if you didn't get to watch 'FRIDAY THE 13TH, HALLOWEEN, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, EVIL DEAD' that night because some parent or other individual had had it removed from the market because they found it offensive?  I would also like for you to think about the child you MAY have or MAY plan to have, would you want your child to be subjected to such things as '10/25 The EXORCIST' or 'GRAND THEFT AUTO and CALL OF DUTY' as a 10 year old? Most likely that answer is 'no', but what if, because they were found offensive, they were simply removed from existence? Then they would never see them and to some that MAY be what's right, and for those of you who think that I have some news for you, those kind of movies are still made today. '10/25 The EXORCIST' has been remade and is more graphic than before, and there are countless other titles that i could throw AT you now that have some form of sexual themes, drug use, or foul language. They still exist and are becoming more and more popular among movies. There are DISNEY movies that will have some sort of sexual reference, a cigarette, or a bad word in them.  You might be able to get rid of a few, but would probably never rid the shelves of all of them. But let's say that you did, that you were, in fact, able to throw away any title that contained these themes. What would there be left to watch? If those movies do not exist any more, then what would your kids have to be able to watch, BARNEY the TELETUBBIES and SESAME STREET-MR. ROGERS? Not only that, but what movies would you watch, if all movies with something offensive in them were removed then you wouldn't have anything left for yourself. Every thing that you might like and/or think is funny in a film, but don't want your child to see is gone.  My answer to you is to not just throw everything out that MAY be offensive, or that you might not want your child to see. Instead of going to such drastic measures to shield your child from them, but to simply not allow them to watch those movies or listen to that music. It's what I'm sure your parents did you, and I know it's what mine do to me, and guess what? It has worked so far, so why should we change it? By exercising parental control and guidance, we can ensure our children's exposure to media is appropriate for their age and maturity level, fostering responsible consumption rather than resorting to censorship that ultimately limits access for everyone.
646	3623	2	3	I don't think that anything that gets checked out from the library should be censored. Some of the people that go to the library aren't looking for material with offensive language and/or themes. On the other hand, there are some people who go to the library who find that having offensive language spoken when it was meant to be is better than censoring it. Take for example a book about @PERSON1. It could have some things in it that people could find offensive. But if someone has to write a report on @PERSON1, it would be best to have as much information on him as possible. I will make one compromise: if there is music being checked out with offensive language, they should provide it with both a clean and explicit version of the album. There are ways that censorship can be good, and some ways that it could be bad. Some people find bad language and themes offensive, while others find that it gives freedom to the artist or author, and I believe that freedom is important. I think that uncensoring things in the good and bad form is better than not uncensoring things at all, as it allows for a more complete understanding and appreciation of the material.
647	3624	2	3	A kid walks into the library up town. He looks around and finds a movie one of his friends recommended to watch. He checks it out and goes home to watch the movie. Later on, his parents come home to see their son acting out of the ordinary. He starts to say rude comments, being violent, and using profanidity. Who is to blame? The friend who recommended the movie, or the library for having this movie on the shelves and letting the young kid check it out? Today, many libraries have a variety of books, movies, music, and magazines to choose from. Some libraries even have computers for kids, teenagers, and adults to use for certain things such as business, personal mail on websites, or games for kids to play. But are all the libraries meeting their requirements? Some people find many books, movies, music, magazines, and even websites threatning. Libraries have movies that are rated PG, PG-13, R, G, or NC-17. They also have music that has explicit lyrics on the CDs. Some libraries may not meet their requirements and that is why libraries do not have as much business as others. In my opinion, I think that if a library has offensive material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and websites, they should be removed from the shelves. If the librarians are letting young kids check out explicit music, and NC-17 movies, they should possibly be fired. From my own experience, I have not had trouble with libraries and materials they have to choose from. I have not visited a library that has had explicit music to choose, all of the bad websites are blocked on the computers, and all of the magazines are appropriate for all ages. In conclusion, libraries should have respect not only for people, but for the materials they have. They need to show respect for the books, movies, music, and magazines they provide for kids, teenagers, and parents. Censorship is required for every library and I think that all the libraries around do meet their requirements, ensuring a safe and appropriate environment for all patrons.
648	3625	2	3	Censorship at the library is not needed at all times. It is the parents who should take the books away from the kids. It isn't the libraries job to tell people what to do. There are certain cases when it's needed though. It's the parent's job to tell the kids what to do. They are the ones in charge of the kids; they are the ones who should teach them right from wrong. They are the ones who are raising the kids, not the library. Otherwise, the parents are having their job done for them.  The libraries have the right to get whatever books they want as long as there isn't anything really bad in them. I do get it if they pull off books, movies, and magazines for adults, but if there is one little word in there, people will just have to get over it.  Isn't that why people are wanting classic books, such as 'Huckleberry Finn' and 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,' changed? Because black people find it offensive? It's not right. People are trying to rewrite history; to sugar-coat the truth. Well, the books are like the real world. People aren't always going to be nice to you. They can be downright mean sometimes. The whole world is just corrupted.  There shouldn't be a problem with just one little bad word in great works of literature. People will curse you out if they feel like it, while in books, the language is limited to one or two bad words. They shouldn't be trying to change great books because the minority find it offensive. The library shouldn't be the ones who tell us what we can and can not read; therefore, the library shouldn't censor their books, as it is ultimately the role of parents to guide their children's reading choices.
649	3626	2	3	The seven books which constitute the 'Harry Potter' series by J.K. Rowling are books which are frequently censored in school libraries accross the country. The main reasoning behind this is that since these books portray witchcraft in a positive light, they must be harming our innocent children. Many books, from John Steinbeck's 'The Grapes in the Wrath' to the 'Harry Potter' series have been banned from school libraries due to their content being deemed inappropriate by a group of people who fail to take the larger meaning of these works into account. Works meant to be accessed by the public should not be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are deemed offensive. Under the First Amendment to the Constitution, every citizen has the freedom of speech, press and religion. By censoring the speech of authors, their rights have been denied. It is an author's right to say what he or she feels needs to be said, and it should not be up to a board of parents or directors to prohibit that right. By prohibiting books such as 'Harry Potter' or 'The Grapes in the Wrath' to be read; the greater meaning of these works is being disregarded. Many conservative parent groups have advocated that 'Harry Potter' be banned from schools because of its portrayl of witchcraft (and therefore satanism) and the nominal fact that Rowling has stated that Dumbledore (the headmaster in the series) is homosexual. However the ultimate message of the series is that love triumphs over evil. Apparently that is not a message worth teaching the youth of America. However, even if every school in the country took 'Harry Potter' off the shelves; that would not, and should not, stop children from reading these books. Since 'The Grapes in the Wrath' began to be part of many schools' curriculum in the 1960s, it has been at the top of the most censored book list due to its vulgar language and a chapter involving a prostitute. That has not stopped millions of teenagers from reading this novel, which is considered to be a rite of passage for most young adults. Being one of the most continuously challenged books over the last fifty years only seems to add to its allure and its popularity amongst the very people that these censorship boards are trying to 'protect'. If a parent, however, does not want his or her child to read such a novel; it should be left to the parent to censor what his or her child reads. But just because one parent does not want their child to read 'Harry Potter', does not mean that every child should be denied the opportunity to read it. Censorship should be a matter of the private, not public sphere. Books and other works should not be censored in libraries. In doing so; an author's freedom of speech is violated and the greater meaning of the work is disregarded. And while certain groups may advocate to protect the children of America from these offensive works; the children will still find a way to access them, so we should trust them to discern the meaning for themselves.
650	3627	2	3	I believe that the view on censorship in libraries is fine as it is for many reasons. The main reasons that I believe censorship in libraries is fine are that almost everything in the library is for people to learn about, whether they read it or watch a movie about it. Another reason is that if they took everything that was offensive or unliked, then there would be a lot less information for people to learn about in libraries.  I agree with Katherine Paterson in her quote because it means that if we took away every book that someone found offensive, then there would be no books left. Every person has different things that offend them, and it would not be possible to remove everything from the library that offended someone. For example, if someone wanted to learn about a historic war from the past, but if someone was offended by the war because they lost a family member or friend to it, should the piece of writing be taken away? Libraries are a place that someone can go to, to learn about something. They hold a lot of information about many different subjects that people go to learn about even if it might be offensive to some people. If someone doesn't like something or finds it offensive, then they should just leave it on the shelf and move on because someone else might learn something important from it. There are things in life that people need to be open to or informed about even though they might not always be pleasant. Libraries are the place that people get introduced to these things, and if these things are removed then where will people go to be informed about this information?  To sum it all up, yes there are things in libraries that some people might find offensive, but other people might learn from it, and it would be unfair to take this information away from everyone else. A library is a place to go to learn about different things and should always have information on different subjects and topics. Many people have learned things from a library that have affected their lives and will keep learning more things as long as they are still open to a wide source of information.
651	3628	2	3	Censorship in Libraries I believe that there should be censorship in libraries. In today's society there are many kids who are hurting and are getting into bad things. There are somethings kids just should not see. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive. Censorship in libraries can steer kids in the right direction. Odds are, if a kid sees his role model on the front of a movie case smoking a cigarette, then that kid is probably going to become curious about smoking. This has happened to me before. I once saw this kid that I looked up to drinking, and I almost took up drinking myself, but because I had the right peers, I didn't. The point is that when kids see someone they look up to doing a certain thing, it has a great impact. If that movie case is sensored then that kid would never even think about smoking because of his role model. Every parent is worried about their kid getting into trouble with the law, right? Some of the movies that a kid can get at a library has the actors doing illegal things in it. A kid will see this and then they will probably think it is cool and go out and do the same thing. I have seen plenty of movies that made me want to go out and do what they did in the movie. What if that thing they see in a movie is murder? It maybe crazy to think that a kid would go out and murder someone because he saw people do it in a movie, but it could happen. A couple years ago I can remember reading an article in the newspaper about a kid shooting his father in the head. This kid was only six years old, but he thought that playing with guns was safe because he saw them do it in the movies. Censorship can take some of the stress off of some parents' backs. Parents stress all the time about where their kids are, what they are doing, who they are with, and so on. If the library censors some of the music and movies that kids watch then his parents will not have to worry too much about him going off and doing bad things because he sees his peers do it. This makes parents feel good and confident in their child's life. Finally, offensive movies are actually offensive, whether this be to the kid himself, the parents, or the audience that the movie is targeting. Keeping offensive movies censored can relieve a lot of hate in a kid's life. I say this from experience. In movies we always see the smart kids getting picked on and it seems like the athletes get all of the attention. Well I am sort of considered that smart kid. I feel that, because of some of the movies my peers have watched, they find it okay to pick on me. This creates hate inside of their hearts, all because censorship was not used. In conclusion it has to be obvious that I feel censorship should be used in libraries. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive. With censorship, all of these things can be accomplished, creating a safer and more positive environment for children. This is not only helpful to the kids, but the parents as well. In my experience, censorship is a good thing to have.
652	3629	2	3	People from all over the world have many different opinions. If someone doesn't like something they do have the choice of not looking at it. Therefore, I believe that when you find something in a library that comes offencive to you you should not be able to remove it. One main reason why I feel that the offensive things shouldn't be taken out of the libraries is because not everyone feels the book, movie, magazine, or music is offencive. People have their own opinions on everything, and if someone takes out a book or any thing in the library because they feel its bad, the other person is going to miss out on something they like to read. Another reason I feel the bad things shouldn't be taken out of the library is because some people could get mad at another person for taking all the offencive things out of the library. Many people like the offencive things in books, movies and soforth. I think from my own prospective that I like having a little bad in my life and if reading a book, watching a movie, listening to music, or even reading a magazine is what it takes I want to be able to go to a library and pick out something good without haveing to worry if its there or not. In my own opinion, I believe that without offencive remarks or words there wouldn't be any humor in books and stuff today. Just because the offencive things seem rude and unapproite doesn't mean that they are. It's just something said to make a book or anything interesting and funny. Although some offincive things in libraries can seem too unapproiate, I believe that if they're there then obviously there not too bad, and they shouldn't be taken out because one person feels that its not something that belongs in a library. Everyone has there own opinions in life and sometimes keeping them to yourself is the best thing to do, allowing others to make their own choices about what they consume.
653	3630	2	3	There are numerous books and movies which are deemed not appropriate for younger audiences. By marking movies with a rating, and marking books with a specific age group, it helps categorize them. In our public libraries, all books and movies are settled into one place for everyone to have the ability to check out. There is the ongoing discussion on whether these should be available to everyone. If a child were to check out a book, and it happened to be rated @CAPS1, the parents would most likely become upset with the library for giving the right to the child to check out a rated @CAPS1 movie. There is also the instance where a parent would have the child check out a specific movie with a @CAPS1 rating, in which the library would be harassed for not letting the child check it out. Furthermore, should public libraries let certain age groups check out movies/books which are not appropriate? The logical answer concludes to no, they shouldn't. If a child cannot see a rated @CAPS1 movie at the theatre, why should they be able to check them out freely at the library? Public libraries should invest in a way to keep underage kids from checking out inappropriate materials. By simply having their age on their library card, there would be a lot of misunderstandings taken care of, and parental controls could be more easily implemented. Our public libraries should take it into their own hands, by changing their censorship policies to reflect age-appropriate access. It would give them a better name, and give our children a secure place to gain access to these materials, ensuring responsible and informed access for all.
654	3631	2	3	Wouldn't it be nice to walk into a library and be able to find any sort of book possible? I believe that it would be very useful and helpful for many libraries to allow a varied censorship of books. In my opinion it would be beneficial to students, parents, or teachers to get information on different topics. As well as many students who need to write a paper about a certain topic that they may not be familiar with, and allowing all the types of books would help anybody with any topic. A library is a place where anyone can go to find information on something, find an interesting read, or just relax. If you're going to get information on a topic that you know nothing about, it would be nice to find a book telling all about the topic. This would help students with reports, along with any other person who is trying to find some extra information they might not know about a topic. If a person was to not want a certain type of books in the library, then I think that person should just try and ignore the books. I think this because I don't think books should be taken out that are beneficial to others, just because it is offensive to someone that could just ignore it. Maybe the books are about drugs, sex, or violence, but they still are able to teach many people that aren't already knowledgeable about the inappropriate, or offensive topics. The presence of such materials allows for a more comprehensive understanding of various perspectives and issues. In conclusion, throwing books out and keeping a library censored, would be a mistake. It is a mistake because it is taking away from many people who are wanting to become knowledgeable about different topics. It takes away from people who need to learn about topics for things such as school, or even work, thereby hindering intellectual growth and access to diverse viewpoints.
655	3632	2	3	No, because if that were the case, every book you read could be offensive to somebody; if they think a book is bad, then they shouldn't read it. First off, a book should not be banned from a library; it is just a book, after all. Second, the only reason they would want to ban a book is because people like to start drama. The third reason is that everything could be offensive to somebody. First off, they should not ban a book just because people don't like it; if your child reads an adult book, that is good for them, for reading those big words. And if they just happen to see a naked picture, it is not the end of the world. I bet it is not the first, and it won't be the last time they encounter such imagery. Second, some people would try to ban a book just to start drama; they know it will cause a lot of crazy things with the author. Finally, if they ban books for being offensive, then they would not have a library because anybody can claim something is offensive. In all, they should not ban even one book, as censorship limits access to diverse perspectives and ideas.
656	3633	2	3	In libraries there are certain materials on the shelves that may be offensive to some people. I have seen some of these materials with my own eyes. But should libraries take them off the shelves because of this matter? That's the question. Some might find it offensive and others might not. It all depends on the person. Libraries can't please everyone. In my opinion, libraries should not take these materials off the shelves, because a material that they take off the shelf could be a material that another person enjoys. Just because you don't take the material off the shelf doesn't mean that there aren't other solutions for those that think the materials should be taken off the shelves. Some solutions to fix this problem could be to take these 'offensive materials' and put them on taller shelves or in a room by themselves so that children or people who do not like the idea don't have to see these certain materials. Then 'people who find it offensive' and 'people who don't' both get a side in this matter and it solves the solution to the problem. If this solution doesn't work there are many more. The libraries can take out the really offensive materials and replace them with others more suitable for all. Overall, I do not think libraries should take out these materials. Just try to make people on the offensive and nonoffensive side both happy; then there will be no more conclusions as in this one, and a compromise can be reached.
657	3634	2	3	Yes I do think that if material in a library is offensive that it should be taken out the library because the library is a place where people go and get a better understanding of something they dont know. Here is why I say this. If you go to a library and you see something that you dont like and you dont think it is appropriate for people to see then it should be taken off the shelf. I wouldn't want anybody in a library unsatisfied with the books, movies, music or anything else especially if children are involved. People should be able to go to a public place where they are satisfied with the way they carry their place, also it should be suitable place for children to come and learn. The library is a learning environment where education, growth and development should be inspired. My reason for saying all this is that a library should be a place where learning should be its number one goal and that if things in the library are offensive to a person that it should be taken off the shelf. I know that children should be able to go to a library and be satisfied on the way the library is. This is important so that the library remains a welcoming and beneficial space for everyone in the community.
658	3635	2	3	No, I don't think materials in libraries should be censored or taken off the shelf. If something is offensive to someone, then that person doesn't need to look at that material. People should have the right to get whatever they want from the library, and if someone doesn't like the materials they have, then that's too bad. What if kids get bad stuff off the shelf? If a kid were to get something bad or inappropriate for themselves, the libraries won't let them check it out, so it is fine, and the parents should be watching what the kids get. I go to the library all the time, and I have never seen anything inappropriate, and I don't know anyone who has ever told me they have found something offensive in a library, because I think the libraries know what people want and what people don't want there. It's not right to take something off the shelves if a few people don't like it, because I'm sure other people like it. But if there is something very offensive that everybody thinks is bad, then you can remove it, but you can't remove material every single time someone complains it is offensive, because then there probably wouldn't be anything left in the library. So I don't think anything should be removed from shelves just because some people find it offensive, because I'm sure just as many people don't find it offensive, and it would be wrong to take it from those people. Therefore, maintaining a diverse collection for everyone is more important than removing materials based on individual objections.
659	3636	2	3	I believe that if there is a book in a library that a child is not allowed to read that the book should be somewhere the kid shouldn't be able to get it. I think those types of books should be stored in the part of the library where a child shouldn't have access to. Also the library should have a section to where only the certain age can read that book. In some libraries there are a bunch of books that are not made for a child to read and they have them to where a child can get access to them and that shouldn't be allowed. So I believe that they shouldn't allow children to get access to those types of books. The same thing applies in a store. In some stores they have a magazine section where there are bad images and words that a kid is not allowed to see. I know in the grocery store that I go to there are inappropriate images and words that a child shouldn't see or read. So there should be an area inside that store that a certain age can access them because one day I was in the store and I saw a little kid reading a magazine and saying the bad words that were in it and looking at the bad pictures it also had in it. So that is the reason they should put the magazines in a place where children shouldn't get access to them. In the same store there is a music section and there are children in it all the time. The music is not all that bad its just that the kids can take these CDs off the shelves and take it home and listen to it. This is the part that is the parents fault by buying the CD for the child to listen to. So if the parent buys the child that CD that is bad it is the parents fault. But I think that the CD's for little children should be in one part of the store and the CD's for the older people should be where they can get access to it. This same thing applies with movies. There are movies in stores that are rated from G, PG, PG13, R, and even for NC-17 audiences only. In a bunch of the movies form PG13 and up have a bunch of stuff in them that a child should not see. Like in the NC-17 audiences only movies they show nudity and a lot more stuff that no one under 17 shouldn't see but they have some of those just sitting on the shelves at stores. So children shouldn't be able to have access to those types of movies. The reason I explained all of this is so children don't get ahold of them. Like in the music if the kids start listening to some bad music they will start saying those bad words and get in trouble at school and anywhere else. Even if the child reads a book that has bad stuff in it they will start saying those words or even do the stuff that happens in the book. In the movies that a child is not supposed to see like a gory action movie or a movie that shows nudity or even a movie that curses that child will see that movie and will show their friends or get ideas form the movie. And these are the reasons why a child shouldn't be allowed to get access to this kind of stuff, therefore age-appropriate segregation of media content is essential to protect children from harmful influences.
660	3637	2	3	The question of whether we should have the right to remove materials from shelves if they are found offensive is a complex one. I firmly believe that we should not possess such a right, as it could lead to the systematic eradication of diverse perspectives and historical accounts, ultimately impoverishing future generations. Even if certain materials contain instances of discrimination, use language deemed offensive, or are simply disliked, their preservation is crucial for maintaining a comprehensive understanding of the world.  Some individuals may perceive discrimination in seemingly innocuous children's books, while others might object to materials depicting or discussing historical discrimination. Granting the right to remove offensive materials would inevitably lead to the disappearance of all such resources. Future generations would be deprived of accurate information about the past, potentially leading to distorted or incomplete narratives.  Furthermore, allowing individuals to remove materials based on personal offense, such as the presence of a single curse word, would result in the loss of countless valuable books and movies. The subjective nature of offense means that a single person's disapproval could lead to the removal of materials enjoyed and appreciated by others.  Personal preferences, such as disliking a book's size or font, should not be grounds for removal. What one person considers a waste of space may be insightful or entertaining to another. The subjective nature of taste means that allowing individuals to remove materials based on personal dislike would lead to a significant loss of diverse content.  Therefore, no one should have the right to remove books, movies, music, or magazines from shelves. These materials serve as invaluable references for future generations. Throughout history, the destruction of disliked materials has resulted in irreversible knowledge gaps. Removing materials based on the opinion of an individual or group is detrimental to preserving a comprehensive and diverse cultural record, and we must ensure that such censorship does not occur.
661	3638	2	3	Removing certain materials from the shelves of libraries is not the way to go. No matter how offensive they might be, there are many other ways to solve this problem. I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from libraries for being too offensive. First off, many people have different opinions about what is offensive and what is not. For example, many people have different intrests than others. Some people @MONTH1 like certain kinds of books and movies while others @MONTH1 not. For instance, one of my favorite types of movies to watch is a comedy. On the other hand, there are many friends of mine that love to watch horror movies. This is something you can not change. Everyone is going to have their own preference on what they want to read, listen to, or watch. Why would you take things away that people actually enjoy? There are other ways to solve this problem. I believe that we can solve this problem by just seperating certain materials from others in the library. For example, if something is thought to be offensive, then it can be placed with others like it. These materials do not have to be removed completely. Mothers are often worried about their children picking up things in the library that they think are offensive. If these materials are seperated from others, there will not be a problem. Certain materials do not have to be removed completly from a library. All in all, there is no need to remove materials from a library because many people have different interests. In conclusion, I believe that materials should not be removed from libraries for being to offensive because individual preferences should be respected and alternative solutions are available.
662	3639	2	3	Take it easy on me. Any source of literature is someone's own creation of imagination, taken in whatever direction they so choose for it to be taken. The creation of that art form as writing would be nothing less than lonesome trash floating the winding streets if it were censored. It is almost like when watching television; your kids are up and want to stay up late to watch the new horror movie but no way, that movie is way too scary for them, plus it shows some nudity. If the movie is not appropriate for your children then do not let them watch it. In a library though, your mother might not always be there to pre-read your books for you. So maybe you just have to assume responsibility and read the book if you choose to, or not read the book depending on how your mother would feel about it of course. The thought of there being censorship in libraries is quite ridiculous. Of course I would not like to see content in my childrens section but that is all up to just having books in their right sections. Have the explicit books on one side of the library and the non on the other side. The main point is that most people that make use of the library are old enough to choose a book of their liking and if they are not they have their mother accompanying them. Ultimately, access and choice, guided by responsible categorization and parental involvement, are preferable to outright censorship, allowing individuals to explore literature according to their own discretion and maturity levels.
663	3640	2	3	There are many different types of books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that fill the shelves of libraries and stores across the country. Consumers are constantly taking these items off the shelves without realizing what they are really buying. Some parents may not even realize what their teenagers or little children are actually buying. Some of the material can be offensive and have a bad influence on those who buy into them. But if parents were more careful about what their children buy then there would not be a problem. That is why these materials should remain on the shelves.  One vital reason these items should not be taken away is because it is the consumer's choice on whether or not they want to buy or check out these items. People should be able to decide for themselves on what they will or will not buy. If they do not want to buy or check these materials out then they should just go to another shelf, or shop at another store. I have seen some parents who do not really care what their children buy, and I have also seen parents go the other way. If stores take away these items that it is almost like taking away their right to make a choice.  It is the adult's responsibility if they do not want their children to watch movies that are for mature viewers. The parent should be able to prohibit certain things until their child is old enough to make its own decisions. If they trust their children with these materials then that is their choice. These offensive items can not just be taken off the shelves just because some people are bothered by them. With the way the media works, it would be difficult to remove all these items from libraries and stores. No matter what there will probably always be a way for younger children to be exposed to these materials. On television there is always commercials that will attract kids or teens and influence them to but their stuff. I have also seen music videos and magazines with their favorite celebrities on the covers. It is almost impossible to control every aspect of society to make it appropriate to younger viewers.  If all the people were able to take all the items that they did not approve of off the shelves, then there would be many of these shelves left empty and bare. If everyone were to take a book they did not like off the shelf then there would be a little selection at the libraries. By taking off one of these books, someone could be taking off another person’s favorite book. People can not just take books off the shelves because they have some bad language. There is a reason for separating the children's section from the adult's section, and it is because some books might not be appropriate for all readers. From my personal experience I have not seen any problems with kids checking out offensive books. Most little kids are attracted to the children's section because of the colorful pages and simpler words.  There is a variety of materials available to the public that can be offensive to some, especially to their little children. As a parent it is their responsibility to keep track of what their children are being shown. People can not take materials off the shelves because it is only offensive to some. This would not be fair to those who enjoy these kind of materials. If they do not want to buy it then they should simply move on to another shelf or to a completely different store. It is their choice as the consumer on whether or not they want to buy into the many different types of books, music, movies, magazines, etc. Therefore, the availability of diverse materials should be maintained, allowing individuals to make their own informed decisions.
664	3641	2	3	I believe that if you are at a library or movie store, or wherever, and there are books, movies, magazines, or CDs that you think are offensive, they should most likely be taken off the shelf. Have you ever walked into a store and seen something not appropriate for little kids, and you get a little embarrassed yourself? I know I have at least at one point in time in my life. Which is why I believe that it should be removed from the store, or at least the shelves, especially if children are present. I always try to think of how my grandparents would feel if they knew what kind of music most teens are listening to today. There is so much terrible language and talk about violence and bad things that really just isn't appropriate for anyone to hear, or even talk about, and it seems to be getting worse. Some people feel different about this, and some people take it a little too seriously, but you have to remember everyone has their own opinion, and my opinion is that we should protect people from potentially harmful content.
665	3642	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 paper, I for one do think that certain books should be removed from the book shelves at the libraries, but I also disagree with that same situation as well. For example, I believe that certain books should be removed from the library shelves because underage children also attend the library, and because other people might find certain books offensive and should not be displayed in a library. My disagreement to the situation is that it's a library, and libraries have different types of books. First, I think that certain books should be removed from the library because it's a public library and not only adults attend that library, but underage children as well. I know that certain books underage children are not allowed to check out, but they are not deprived of their privileges of staying in the library reading such books. Next, I do not agree that certain books should be viewed on library shelves because other people might find such a book offensive to be in a library. The reason I say this is because some books oppose humor to other people's race, and if for say a Black, Mexican, maybe even an Arabian person was to come in the library looking for a book and happened to fall upon a book that talks about their race, most people would take that offensively. However, I do not think that any book being deprived from a library is the best approach. My reason for thinking that is simply because it's a library, and libraries are developed for many people's types of interest in books. And I don't think it will be fair that certain books should be removed from the library because people think they are inappropriate in certain people's interest in books. And people should be free to come in and look at books without having to search for books that interest them but are removed because other people find them offensive. Therefore, I do and also don't agree that a library should be stripped of a book because it lacks interest in someone or offends someone, and that such a person should 'put the shoe on the other foot' as the saying goes and try to see from other people's point of view, acknowledging that perspectives and sensitivities differ.
666	3643	2	3	When you go places, there will always be something that one won't like; not everyone likes everything. A library has to be the worst place for people not liking things. Censorship in libraries is getting worse and worse every day; it is in everything: in books, movies, music, and magazines. Should we keep things like this on shelves? Everyone that will read this will think differently about censorship in libraries. On the shelves are lots of things with bad language [and] naughty pictures. These books little kids can pull off a shelf and see things that their parents don't want them to see. Censorship is everywhere, not just in libraries. The books and things in the libraries need to be changed and not be so bad. If there is a need for things like this, then have a special store for things like this, as the current situation presents challenges regarding potentially unsuitable materials being accessible to children.
667	3644	2	3	Censorship in libraries is kind of a big deal in schools. There @MONTH1 be a book that someone really wants to read, and they cannot get it in their school's library. A lot of books that are great educational books have been taken off of the shelves of libraries, because they are either too violent, or they have bad language in them. If kids or parents are offended by these types of books, then they do not need to check them out. There should not be censorship on books in schools. There should be freedom to access diverse perspectives.  There have been a lot of books, teachers view as being educational books, that have been taken off of the shelves in libraries. Books that teachers would like to give to there class to read. There should not be any problem with giving someone a book that has a few bad word, or a few violent scenes for them to read. Some of the books that are banned could relate to someone, and touch them. Banning books in libraries needs to change. Students should have the opportunity to engage with challenging material.  People should have the right to read what they want to read, even if the book or magazine comes from a school library. There are books that are very good that have been banned. '@CAPS1 for @PERSON1' for example was banned in public schools for some reason. This book is one of my top five favorite books, and i could not check it out of the library because it was banned. This kind of stuff needs to be open to everybody no matter the age. Limiting access hinders intellectual growth.  Censorship in libraries is something that needs to go away for good. Many peoples lives could be changed, touched, moved, etc... due to a book. Many books that have been banned are great books that can have an effect on someones life. People should be able to read what they want to read when and where they want to read it, so libraries should champion intellectual freedom and the unrestricted flow of information.
668	3645	2	3	I think certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because the word is just saying 'OFFENSIVE', or those things should be placed where not everybody can get it, like the little kids or when your religion doesn't accept that kind of things. For example in my opinion there are some books, music, movies or magazines that show images or words that are offensive, and not just for me or other people too. Offensive for me is when its not an appropriate thing like certain images, videos or bad words that should not be use for everybody to hear or see. You have to be careful when you think something is offensive because not everyone thinks like you, and everybody has a different opinion and conclusion and we have to remember, we have the power to talk, read and write what we think is best. I'm not saying that they should prohibit certain books or music, I'm just saying that there is time for everything and we are young and we are looking for a good future, not just for us also for the younger kids and the older people have to provide us the best they can, because they have experience and they know what is best for their kids. This is a free country and people should express their opinion and make it worth, if you think something is being bad say it, and its important to remember do not let people offend you with words or images and don't let them force you to do something offensive for someone else. Therefore, we should strive to create a society where sensitivity and respect guide our choices about the content we share and consume, ensuring a more positive environment for all.
669	3646	2	3	In today's world there are so many things around our children that if we tried to take materials away, we would be taking most of what is made for entertainment. Many adults say that our world has changed so much from the time when they were younger. Well, why don't we do something about it? People need to stop complaining about everything and just do something. Adults can eliminate the amount of materials the children take home with them. If you were to walk into any store these days you would find something that you would not want your children to watch, see, or listen to. I believe people are doing the best they can to separate these materials from the family oriented materials. Sometimes it is just not enough, children are still getting addicted to some materials at a very early age. These children share what they have with their friends, and these other children start doing the same things. Many materials such as movies and music have negative ideas that teach children things they do not need to know or learn. The material that talks about drugs, parties, and drinking does not even need to be on a radio station or a television channel that a young child would listen to. Our adults need to also learn that it is not good for the children to learn and listen to these things, and to keep their children away from it as much as possible. Like the author said if everyone was able to take something off of the shelves there would not be anything left. We are always going to have these things that we do not want children to see, but we can start to eliminate some of them. The others we can not eliminate we can continue to keep on the shelves and other places, but just kept where children don't go. I believe that our towns and cities can do a better job of keeping our children away from R rated movies, negative songs, and different books that talk about 'adult things.' The children are the future of the world. If that's all they are watching and thinking about then it does not look good for the future. There are many things we can do to stop our children from watching, listening, and learning about these negative things in life. Keep the children away from these materials, it will be a better world if we do. Therefore, it is vital to prioritize children's exposure to positive and age-appropriate content for a brighter future.
670	3647	2	3	There are many books, music, movies, and magazines that people find offensive. Some people even believe these things should be taken off the shelves. I do not believe that the books, music, movies, or magazines should be taken off the shelves completely. Not everyone finds these things offensive and they should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them. First, people have different views on what they find offensive. Not everyone will find the same things offensive or want the same books or song to be removed. With people always having different views it is difficult to take books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves for everyone. Just because one person does not agree with what is being said in the movie or book does not mean that every single person wants that movie or book to be removed. If one person found my favorite book offensive I would not want it taken off the shelves completely. Equally important, if every book, song, movie, and magazine that someone finds offensive is taken off the shelve there would not be many books, movies, songs, or magazines left. Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove a book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is saying that if every single book that offends someone is taken off the shelves there would be no books for anyone to read. People find different things offensive and if everyone took these things off the shelves there would be none left for anyone. Consider the vast range of literary works, musical genres, and film styles; the potential for offense is incredibly diverse.  Finally, if someone finds a book offensive they do not have to read it. When someone finds a book, movie, song, or magazine offensive they don't need to watch it or read it. Instead of taking it off the shelves the person could just not read it. Not everyone finds the same books offensive and taking them off the shelves could upset many people. When someone finds something offensive they could just avoid that instead of getting it removed and upsetting other people. If someone was offened by one of my favorite books, I would prefere if they just avoid reading it instead if taking it off the shelves so that I can not read it. Some people find many books, songs, movies, and magazines offensive. They would like these things to be removed from the shelves permenatly. I, however, do not believe that these things should be removed. Taking these off the shelves could make some people happy, it could also upset even more. Not everyone finds the same things offensive and should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them. Therefore, allowing individuals to make their own choices about what they consume, rather than imposing censorship based on subjective offense, is the most reasonable approach.
671	3648	2	3	Imagine walking out of your home and you see right down the street a giant bonfire, right in the open. You see men walking into a library empty handed and walk out carrying armfuls of books, magazines, movies, and other media. The men then toss them into the raging inferno and you see them become incinerated, lost forever. This is what will happen if we let censorship of our libraries take place. We should not let censorship of our libraries take place since it violates a constitutional right, will gradually make our society more and more ignorant, and will let this nation slide from a democratic nation to one where the beliefs and ideals of the people are controlled by a small group of people. Letting censorship of our libraries take place will violate a basic constitutional right, plain and simple. In the First Amendment it clearly says that there will be freedom of the press. By tossing out certain literary works this right will be thrown to the side and by violating one constitutional right, what will come next? Will our freedom of speech be negated, or our freedom to assemble? As citizens of the United States we can not let this happen to our great nation. By allowing certain books and essays to be thrown out of our libraries, the people's knowledge base will eventually shrink down drastically. For example take Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, a very sensitive subject among people of the Christian faith. If all of his works regarding that were to be thrown out, much information that was very valuable to biologists would be lost and those biologists would not be able to improve upon the existing pool of information. If this was to take place our civilization would experience a lessening intellect and a expanding ignorance regarding many fields of knowledge. Picture Germany in the 1930s. Hitler's Nazi party has taken power and our systematically destroying all materials they find to be subversive to the Nazi cause, only allowing materials that contained beliefs and ideals that they thought were correct to exist in libraries. This is exactly what we would be doing if we allowed censorship of our libraries to take place. The censoring of the libraries would be controlled by a relatively small group of people which means that the censoring would be controlled by that same people's beliefs and ideals, and those same beliefs and ideals would thus be forced upon the people, shaping the beliefs and ideals of the masses to those select few. In conclusion, letting censorship take place in our public libraries will dismantle the basic structure of our society by violating a constitutional right, making our society gradually become more and more ignorant, and letting the beliefs and ideals of our people rest in the hands of a select few. This is not what our Founding Fathers envisioned America to become and they were right. Letting censorship exist in our public libraries is simply wrong.
672	3649	2	3	Everyone has things that would offend them, whether they admit it or not. Books are known to do this to people. However, there are all different kinds of books, music, and all the other materials that could offend all different kinds of people. There are even books read in school classrooms that offend people. Reading is an important thing and whether or not the reader likes it, they will come across one that offends them. I believe we have the right to have those offending things because there are so many books who offend people, music and movies have censorship, and if they don't like it they should ignore it. First of all, we have the right to have these kinds of books. Just like in life, there are certain things people don't like, but deal with it anyway. That's what this is. Even though there are the handful out there that don't like those certain books, those books are the ones that are well liked and become famous. I have read a book that people have wanted to ban and it was one of the best books I have read. To sum that all up, if we took away every book that one person didn't like, there would be only few left. If we censor too much, we risk losing valuable perspectives and stories that challenge us. Secondly, music and movies have censorship. You can choose whether you want that censorship or not. Movies tell what ages are okay to watch those movies. Music blocks out the words that need to be. If they don't want it they don't have to listen to it or watch it. We all have the certain things we love and hate, we can't eliminate all of the hated things. Last of all, in my opinion if they don't want it they don't have to have it. The music and movies are an option to people, they don't have to listen or watch something they think is a bad idea. It's all opinionated, there isn't a right or wrong to it. I know of people out there who don't have televisions or they don't listen to the radio, that's perfectly fine. They don't have to complain about because they don't pay any attention to it. To wrap this all up, there are so many books out in the world that offend people, the music and movies have censorship, and if they can't stand it they don't have to deal with it. As I said, these books, magazines, music, etc. are very well liked by many of people, so why get rid of them for those few who get offended? We all have things we do and don't like that we cannot do anything about. As Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Therefore, we should embrace the variety of viewpoints and allow individuals to make their own choices about what they consume.
673	3650	2	3	There I was, shuffling my way through the library, finding the perfect books to check out. It was then that I had stumbled upon a book that looked incredibly interesting. The cover page featured a depressed girl with the look of hope plastered on her face and the back included the summary of a book I wanted to get my hands on. The book, titled *Finding Hope*, was about a girl who went through some troubled times but found her way out of it. Stories, novels, magazines, or books on tape of any type find their way onto our library shelves, it is then our job to discover them. Whether literature includes stories of love and heartbreak, sorrow and depression, or the success of a sports team, it should all be allowed on our library shelves. Opinion, everyone has one that conflicts with someone elses. Our world revolves around these different viewpoints and ideas, should our literature and music not reflect these opposing sides? Literature is an escape for many people, it is their way of experiencing the world and to live through the main character of whatever they are reading. If we remove books that might be offensive to one, we are taking away that opportunity for others. In my opinion, the removal of the potentially offensive material in our libraries, is sheltering our world. Regardless of how hard we try, children and teenagers will one day be exposed to the offensive material we are attempting to remove from their lives. We should not attempt to hide what our actual world is like, rather allow them to experience it in a safe way, like reading or listening to music. If someone views material as offensive, it should be the parent's responsibility to regulate whether their child reads or listen to it or not. The removal of the potentially offensive material would not be any help. In conclusion, offensive material should not be removed from our libraries, rather regulated through our parents or elders. The idea of regulating what is on our shelves is not the most effective solution to protecting young people from potentially harmful information. If any material has the potential of being offensive, it is not the library's role to regulate whether or not it is displayed to the public.
674	3651	2	3	The censorship in a library should be kept the same as it is already. A few reasons explain why the censorship is alright as it is. Those reasons are that the parents should be in charge of the books their children read, that not all people agree on censorship, and that the libraries have books of different subjects that people like to read. The first reason is that parents should be in charge of what their children read. If the parents would just tell their children no to a certain book, then the child will not read it. If the parent does not want their child to go into a section then, the parents can just say keep away from that area. Although, sometimes the child might stray away from its parents it is not very likely that the parent will not notice. The parents can guide their children toward age-appropriate and suitable reading materials, ensuring a comfortable experience. That is why the parents should be in charge of what their children read. The second reason is that not all people agree on censorship. Certain people think that religion is important no matter what the book shows, but others would think parts of religious books (nudity, swears, etc...) is extremely inappropriate. Some people would say that books like Greek mythology books are inappropriate and need to be censored, although others think these books are past culture and that they should remain in the libraries forever. Most children will look at these books and think that the books are too big to read, so they would not even look at them. Few people would agree on censorship, and a lot of people would disagree. The third reason is that libraries have different subjects than the inappropriate books. The people can look at a different book and completely ignore the others. It is not like a child will go up to the dirtiest book they can find and say 'I want to read that one.' the child will probably want something that relates to a television show or a movie of some sort. Libraries offer a wide range of genres, catering to diverse interests and age groups, ensuring that readers can find books that resonate with them. The point being that a person can read other books than just inappropriate books. Library books should be kept the same because the parents should be in charge of what their children read, not all people agree on censorship, and libraries have different subjects that people want to read. The censorship should be fine according to some people other would disagree. The children probably would not look at the inappropriate book anyways, because they would not interest the child. In conclusion, maintaining the current level of censorship in libraries strikes a balance between parental guidance, diverse opinions, and the availability of various reading materials.
675	3652	2	3	So you see a nice, old lady looking at one of many books throught a library, she chucks *it*. You look at her, she looks at you, she walks away. You go and pick up the book, *it's* about medical marijuana. She took offense to that? I don't really care what people gotta say, if *it's* on the shelf, *it* stays on the shelf. I'm convincing librarians, readers, and everyone else that if you have offense to a book, magazine, movie, or anything you can find at a *public* library, shut your fat mouths. A library serves many purposes, one, *it's public*, *it's* open to anyone and everyone. Two, if you have a library card, you can check out books, movies, music, etc. Three, if your walking down the road and 'gotta go,' you can stop right in and leave. What I'm trying to say is that nothing should be removed from any shelf at any library. Yeah, I mean there's a certain point at which you got to take charge, but even then you can have an adolescent room or what not. I think that if you take something off the shelf at a library, you can just taking away part of the heart. Let's say you have *10* *public* libraries in your town, one library has one thing the other doesn't have. Someone riots and they get to take *it* off the shelf. Your never going to find that anywhere else unless you buy *it* off line. And sometimes, that can get a little pricey, especially since you can get *it* free at a library? But then again, I see where people are coming from to take certain materials off the shelfs. Say you gotta *2*-year old kid, and he walks up to you carrying a sex love book. What can you say about that? I mean in sounds corny but *it* can happen. Most parents just want to keep their kids in a safe, harmless enviroment. That's where they come in and say, 'I thought this was a *public* library?!' Then that's where *it* goes bad. After all that happens, people just accuse the librarians to *why* they got these books, movies, and music that's just bad for a young kid. But *it's* not the librarians' fault, different people like different books, that's *why* a library has many, many choices when *it* comes to books. That's when the question comes up, *'Why* don't we just have seperate rooms, for seperate books?' *Well*, that sounds good and all, but who's gonna pay for *it*? Libraries get donated alot of their stuff, they are profitable, but then again a non-profitable resource. Libraries have been around for ages, most of them started out small and now are big. That's when the library gets donations, looks through them, and sells the books they don't want or need. They make money off that, that's when they start making seperate rooms. *It* sounds crazy, but *it* wouldn't cause a riot to go on about people. Therefore, people are happy, librarians happy, and most of all you are happy. You can find the book you want or need easy as one, two, three. All you gotta do is go to that certain room, look for *it*, check *it* out and you got a nice book to be reading anytime. *It* sounds easier that looking *it* up, get the dewy decimal number, find the number. All in all, we shouldn't remove anything from a library shelf bevause *it* *might* be the only one in your town, maybe the only one in your state, maybe through the whole country. You never know. All I gotta say is, *'It's* better to keep a book, than to forget a book.
676	3653	2	3	Maybe, to a sense I do not think that books should be removed to an extent. The reason for this is because some books, magazines and other stuff can be informative. They can help you with certain questions. They do not always answer what you need but they are there to look back at and see what type of generation we have. But, there is also other reasons things that can be offense to others. People can take that aspect to the next level to where they are getting hurt. I think that maybe certain books and magazines should be removed. They tend to do damage to others and can hurt other people. The sense of this nature is to ask the store to remove the books or magazine. The store can not take the books off the shelf if one person is offended by the book. If you take every offensive book of the the shelf then you will not learn from the other mistakes it has taken on other peoples lives. They maybe think it would be a good idea to books off the shelf but younger adults could not learn the mature items that the parents do not want to teach. They think they are doing the right thinking by not showing you sexual offenive stuff. You do not want kids or others to see this sexuality and see what the world is becoming. Also, I can see why they would want to take that stuff off the shelves. They do not like what they see but they think it is the truth and is very offensive to see the sexual, mental illness people have. Certain books should stay on the shelf such as a Anatomy book. Anatomy books so the human body they do not hid the human body we should know about the human body. So the Anatomy books and magazines should stay on the shelf. If you want to look at naked provakadive stuff then go to a sex store. Do not put out books in public that can show the sexually side of humanbeings. The Anatomy magazines are there to learn not for enjoyment. You can go to a different store for enjoyment. But, if you take off stuff that can be offensive to others then that means you would have to take off the Anatomy items. People could get offenive by not looking like the poeple in the magazine. That could offend them so would you take it off the shelf or not. Not you would not becasue a Anatomy book is there for you learning envoirment not to ofen you. That also could go for the sexual magaizes. Yes, sex is good for you but would you want to teach that to ounger kids that fast. You would want to teach them about sexual introcourse not a magazine. I know that Anatomy books and tapes can be incouraging sex but they are mainly talking to adults. As far as music and tapes go no I do not think that those types should be removed. That is for enjoyment and people liek to relax to this sorta stuff. I mean I do not buy tapes of rap's or music but othe people do. They enjoy it if you did take it off then what else would they put up? You have to think about the younger generations. The older generations lived a happy not violent life. But, for teenagers now in certain places they have it hard. They need to make a living on the street. They need something to listen to. This offensive music is to listen sure some music is horrible but what music isnt these days. If music is what you are instersed in then why would we take it off the shelves. People make a living listeing to music and cerating it for others. It is a wonderful thing it really is what makes the world go around. Making stores and stands take the music and newspapers off would be a disappointment to see such a wonderful thing go down the hole because it hurt others. If you go back to the 70's there music was about drugs as well and nobody ever had a problem about that. Maybe people don't have a problem with it but its becaseu they grew up around it. Just like we have grown up to the rap and the sexual musice. We are teenagers and you were once a teenager. You know you would not be listeing to a beetles song that wouod not be about drugs or sex or getting high. The beetles sang about all the stuff singers sing about now. Generations change and so does the enivorment but you can not change they way we grew up. You can try to make it better but it will take a lot of will power. The generations now are tough and they wont let down. You might as well stop trying to take down what we grew up to away from us. Nobody was trying to take away your music so why would you take away ours. It's not something you want to take away it's somthing you want to look back and see how much are generations have changed from one to another, and that's why we should
677	3654	2	3	In my opinion, I believe all types of material should be allowed in libraries. If someone takes offense to a particular topic or section, they don't have to read it. Not just certain types of genres and themes or magazines. Everyone's different, meaning they have different personalities and views on what they like. I think libraries should actually expand their variety of books. Libraries that don't cater to a person's desires or interests, what would make them want to stay? Libraries should be filled with all sorts of subjects appealing to everyone, just like how they have an adult and children's section; everyone has a place where they feel like they belong, even if some people get offended. A person can get offended anywhere, not just by a certain magazine or some music style.  I do believe if there is a certain line of respect, of course. Nothing should get too out of line where it's an issue with a numerous amount of consumers complaining about the same topic. You can tell if a certain section or material is crossing the line; each section should be written to speak the truth but also in a respectful manner.  In the times that I've been to the library there might be some things that I don't agree with how certain things are certain ways. But then I see a person really enjoying their time at the library. I know when I go I always find my style of music that appeals to me, not just the same thing everywhere I go. There are always choices, different options, and more things I can learn about.  Keeping all the materials like books, music, movies, etc., is a way to appeal to everyone. A person should have their opinion and the choice to be able to read what they like. There will always be a certain movie or book you don't care for, but others might. If everyone told what they like and don't like about a certain book, where's the variety? What books will be left? Everyone has their own thoughts on what they like, if there's a topic you don't like you probably know least about it, and the library is a good way to search and find information about anything, allowing people to explore diverse perspectives and broaden their understanding.
678	3655	2	3	This essay is all about whether certain materials in libraries should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive to some. I do not believe things should be removed from shelves in libraries if they offend someone. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't mean its offensive to all. If you are offended by somethings they display there are ways that you can avoid seeing them. One thing you can do to avoid it is never go by or around the shelves displaying it, ask for help so you get whatever it is that you need, or try to search what your looking for on the internet. When I visit the library I already know what I'm going to get so I have never found anything offensive to me. If I did find something offensive to me I would complain and if they didn't do anything about it I would just never go back. I would just research online or go to another library where I know they will meet my needs. The libraries I go to always have sections separating the different age groups, such as children, teens, and adults. I've been to the library numerous times and I have never heard anyone with a complaint about something being offensive. If the library had something that would offense me I wouldn't know. Every time I go I stay in one particular section for teens and look at magazines and books. I feel that if people are offended by what they see on the shelves they should just avoid or ignore it because everyone has their own opinion on what offends them and what doesn't, and a library should strive to provide a wide array of materials for everyone.
679	3656	2	3	I think we should not take it off the shelf because what might be offensive to you might not be offensive to me, or it might be something that is fun or, I think, beneficial to me. And what might be offensive to me might not be offensive to you. And I think if something is offensive to someone, they should just walk off, or just not mind it; therefore, there is no need to remove it for everyone.
680	3657	2	3	I believe the current way materials are censored and removed works, and should continue. While everyone @MONTH1 dislike a particular novel or book, libraries can not remove every book a person dislikes, as Katherine Paterson said. When a book appears so controversial to the point where the majority of people disapprove of it, then the book usually is taken off of the shelves. The possibility children will see the offensve material appears unlikely. Most public libraries do not put their offensive material near the childrens books. At my local library, their is a section that has the more offensive or obscene books all in one place. To acquire these books you must have a parents permission or be @NUM1 years of age. It is very unlikely a child would ever see the materials in question. Numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated. @PERSON3 @PERSON2 @MONTH1 have had racial slurs in it, but if one considers the time and place of the novel, these slurs were normal for the time. Someone can not be frustrated with a novel written @NUM2 years ago because it has something offensive in it by todays standards. Context is important when considering artistic expression. While I believe, for the most part, libraries should not censor or remove materials, there should be some restrictions set in place to keep extremely harmful materials out of libraries. For instance, libraries should not have dirty magazines or movies on their shelves. If a high majority of people want a particular material banned, then it is hard to ignore them. When a book is so vulgar people begin to protest the book, there are questions as to whether the book should remain on library shelves. When a high percentage of people join that cause, then it should be banned. Censoring or removing materials from libraries remains a hot topic today. I believe the current system in place to censor or remove books does its job, and that it should continue. If few people disapprove of a particular material, the book remains in most shelves uncensored. When a lot of people begin to protest that same material, it has a high probability of being banned. With this process, every book with a racial slur or questionable scene is not removed, while the ones that truly deserve it are removed, demonstrating a balanced approach.
681	3658	2	3	Have you ever been at the library and asked yourself any of the following questions? Who reads this? Why is it here? Are kids reading or watching this stuff? Do kids check these out? Or have you ever wondered or said to yourself any of these statements? I don't want my kids to pick this up and read this. This is so offensive. This goes against all our morals. I don't know what kind of freak convention this is but I'm no part of it. Let's get out of here. This place is wack. Ever consider what books get banned from the library? Who bans the books?  I think things should have to be very offensive to pull them off the shelves. I think that they should just stick them to a side of the library and put an age on it or you have to be a certain age to check out those books. I don't think the cursing books are that offensive. When the person (no matter who it is) goes out into the world, they are going to learn and hear curse words. People use them like they do the words 'and' or 'the'. They are going to hear them till their grave. Whether they choose to use them or not, that's their choice.  For them to be banned or moved to a different group of books they should have to be sexist, racist, have a lot of sex, or just really gruesome. I think they should go upstairs with the mushy romance and whacked-out western. I mean people could go up there and check them out but that is the adult library area. The staircase should be by the circulation desk. When they are not busy they should go upstairs and check and see if there are any young children up there.  I think the top level or a certain area should be the adult area. They have mushy lovey-dovey stuff, they have cowboy shoot-off stuff, and the offensive stuff. The stuff with too much sex, really racist, or really sexist, or gruesome stuff like people killing people for fun. Also, they should have the adult magazines up there too. Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about. You know how you go down an aisle at the market and there are girls in their bikini and half-naked. Then there are the Cosmos, both should be upstairs. I mean they talk about how to give pleasurable sex. I would hate for some little 1 year old or 2 year old to pick that thing up she would be scarred for life.  Then the main level or area should be teen books. You know vampire books, superheroes, crazy fiction stuff, and then the magazines and movies that aren't bad. Then the bottom level should be the children's level. Games, puppets, movies, and easy books. That about sums that up.  I don't think just anybody should be able to ban a book. I think it should be open but not just anyone. There should be a huge meeting, with the mayor, a couple of teachers one English teacher from each level, and parents, and the librarians. The person who wants it banned should have to tell everyone why and stuff. Like Author Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have the exact same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left for any of us.' Therefore, a careful and considered approach with diverse voices is necessary when deciding what should be restricted, ensuring access to information is balanced with community values.
682	3659	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a complex issue with many differing viewpoints on whether certain materials should be removed. I believe that if books, movies, and magazines are placed on the shelves, they should be accessible to everyone, including children. It is essential for them to learn about the world around them. If they don't learn about these things now, they will be unprepared later in life. It is critical for our youth to be informed. Some argue that young people are too young to be exposed to certain content, but early exposure can be beneficial in the long run. Therefore, I believe that open access to library materials is important for the education and development of young people, ensuring they are well-informed and prepared for the future.
683	3660	2	3	I believe certain materials shouldn't be removed simply because a few individuals dislike their content in books, movies, or music. If we catered to every objection and removed books based on personal preferences, others would be deprived of reading material they enjoy. For instance, if someone requests the removal of a violent book about murder, another person who frequents the library every month might specifically seek out that type of book. Similarly, if a parent finds their children watching movies with gang, drug, or violence themes, they might want the movies removed. Instead of removing content enjoyed by others, parents should address the issue directly with their children and enforce consequences when they watch inappropriate material.  A possible solution is for libraries to create a designated area for mature content, ensuring supervision and restricting access for children. Many adults enjoy movies with drugs and violence, and these movies and books should not be removed due to the opinions of others.  Ultimately, if someone dislikes the language or imagery in a book or movie, they have the option not to read or watch it. If children access such material without permission, that is a parental responsibility issue. Instead of trying to censor content, parents should be more aware of their children's activities. Sometimes offensive language is used in books and movies to realistically portray aspects of the real world. The goal is to create an authentic experience. Therefore, removing materials based on personal objections can limit artistic expression and individual choice.
684	3661	2	3	Censorship; the aspect of removing offensive materials from the public eye. Is this the right thing to do? Should society as a whole take away variety? Do you believe our generation or future generations should not get to experience and understand what the past generations have? I believe censorship is wrong in every aspect, but I also believe that materials that are offensive, or unappropiate for certain ages can be controlled. Movie theatres, video stores, **Netflix**, and television all do it. They use ratings and age control for their viewers. Now control can be difficult, and **may** not always work if not handled correctly. To handle this situation before it arises, the library can use a system like restaraunts or bars use; such as, checking identification before letting a book that is **R** rated or above be checked out. Different sections in the library can be available to certain age groups. Now you **may** be thinking; doesn't this idea take away from the liberties that libraries give us? Well you **may** be right, but you would rather have our children see violence and other inappropiate materials that they shouldn't? It would be just like the movie theatre. You would not need to buy a ticket, but the control of content would be phenomial compared to what it is. Would you want your six year old girl picking up an adult violence movie, sexual content movies, or even a **book** with cursing in it? Why should the library offer things for children that parents would frown upon? I believe the library should be a place of learning and freedom, but the learning should be something age appropiate. Our society is maturing too fast for young children, why should the library take part in that? Libraries located in schools do not even offer this material because they know that the majority of the readers' for their library are students. This being said why should public libraries be okay with stocking this material. Yes, media is everywhere. Movies, books, magazines, newspapers, music, and much more flash and sell more than they should. Media shows children things they shouldn't know about until they are young adults, but does this make it okay? Does it make is right for children to see and want all they want to? No, it does not. Fighting fire with fire only makes a larger fire. Why start our children out at a young age with violence, sex, and inappropiate material? Would you like to set your children up to fail? I know I wouldn't so why let our libraries hand out books, magazines, movies, and more to let our children thrive upon the culture they are stuck with? I do not think we should remove these books from our libraries because everyone has a different opinion, but I do believe that control needs to be put into place for our children's and other children's sacks. With that being said, censorship is overrated, but some of the material at the library are underrated, and that needs to be handled and controlled, ensuring a safer and more appropriate learning environment for all children.
685	3662	2	3	Everyone has a favorite book. And some of us can't put it down once we read the first sentence. Then days later, the library takes it down and states that it's offensive to many people that have read it. Why should multiple people lose a good read just because someone doesn't like what they see? We're all trying to accomadate to everyone and their needs just to please them. Whatever they ask is done because we don't want a big scene. A majority of people think, 'That book is offensive! Take it down! Disgusting!'. But why? Everyone has a right to read what they want to read. No library should uphold to the needs of a minority about an 'offensive' book just because they say it's inappropriate. Who are we to judge what's good for everyone and what's not? Books are written for a reason, and that's to share the ideas of the author, not to corrupt society with their 'evil' and 'offensive' ideas that could potentially cause a child to rebel. That excuse is ridiculous. A parent should've taught their child to differentiate between right and wrong, and if they use the ‘child will become a rebel if they read this!’ excuse, then they're not confident in their childs capability, or the fact that they taught their child well.  Also, it's not just the readers getting angry, it's the author. How bad would someone feel if they spent a year or two on a fantastic book, just to have it banned from library after library? Probably angry or upset. Authors have the right to write whatever they want. If they wish to talk about dragons and princesses, so be it. If they want to discuss why we see a full moon when we do? Go right ahead. No one can stop great books from being made and they certainly shouldn't be able to stop people from reading it. If someone is offended by a book, then don't read it, simple as that.  Parents like to protect their children from harms way and bring them up as fine citizens of society. By having this desire, the parents do every little thing to make sure their son or daughter doesn't see, hear, or read anything inappropriate or 'bad'. This is just ridiculous. Controlling a childs life will just cause them to rebel more and more as they get older. Let children have a choice in what book they read, or the movie they watch. Parents need to teach their children right from wrong, and in doing so, letting them see, hear, or read whatever they want should be no problem.  Without books, movies, and music, what would the world be like today? No one knows. Books are a great source of information, letting the author express themself as well. Movies are almost just as harmless, limits are needed, but overall? There should be no problem. Also, music allows the artist to bring out their side of creativity and emotion. Allowing that music, or movie, or book to be made, and then take it away is ridiculous. If it offends someone, then that person should just forget it, instead of taking it away from the people who love it and the person who made it. Ultimately, the freedom to create and consume art is paramount, and censorship based on subjective offense stifles creativity and limits individual growth.
686	3663	2	3	I don't think there should be any censorship; good books and music shouldn't be removed just because one person finds it offensive because the opinions of one individual might be different from another. I believe music is censored the most, because not many people get offended by books, but censorship in music, I think, is destroying it. Because it's an artist's way of expression, and if people don't want to listen to what they're saying, then they should just not listen to it. Books, I think, shouldn't be taken offensively for the same reason music shouldn't; it's a writer's opinion and expression. It's like telling someone they can't voice their opinion on anything, like racism, or use curse words if they want. Therefore, artistic expression, whether through music or books, should be free from censorship, allowing artists to express themselves without fear of suppression.
687	3664	2	3	To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3: I am writing to you today concerning censorship in libraries. I have had a select few instances throughout my life where I have read a book or magazine that to some @MONTH1 seem offensive and to others not at all. However, I do have my own view point on the situation and I feel that it is my duty to inform you that I feel offensive books, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves.  Everyone has grown up and been taught different values and morals that are important to them. They stand for these values, but at the same time respect that other people have the right to believe differently than they do. With the world the way it is now, violence can erupt from the simplest of things. Putting books on public shelves for the public to read, can very easily cause outbursts and debates between people who have opposite opinions. Offensive books and magazines put out for the public is asking for something bad to be a result.  My suggestion to you is to remove these offensive books. This will create a safe and happy environment for all who visit public libraries,and other public places. It will create fewer arguments between adults and set an example for younger children who are observing their parents behaviors. Children follow in their parents' footsteps. Observing bad behaviors from the parents due to offensive books does not teach the child how to act in a responsible way if they were put in this postion. When our children grow up, we want them to beahve in a responsible way. Offensive books not being put on shelves will hopefully create a healthful environment for appropriate behavior.  As a student, I want to grow up in a world that has people who are resepectful, happy, and responsible. I want people to get along with each other. I feel that taking offensive books off shelves will help with this somewhat peaceful world I would like to live in. Violence can be created through anything, and I feel that offensive books should be the last thing added to that. Without offensive books for the public to read, will create a better environment for the people living today and allow for a more harmonious community for everyone.
688	3665	2	3	Removal of Books If there is a book that someone takes offensive, should every book similar to that book be taken of shelves? No, even though people may find things in books offensive, they should not remove the books off shelves. When I was in the sixth grade my teacher asked me to read and write a summary on 'A Long Walk to Water'. I searched the whole library for the book then finally decided to ask for help, the privilege to read the book was taken away. The book was no longer allowed in elementary schools, due to the fact parents were seeing what their children were reading and found the book very offensive. After many reports about the book, the book was taken out of the library. For me to do as my teacher asked I had to go to a public library and get the book. If you find a book offensive keep it to yourself and don't read the book, they shouldn't be able to remove books just because of what people think of them. Many people love different types of books, no matter if they are offensive or not others may like them. I believe that everyone has a right to read anything they want, books are made to be read and looked at. If books are being taken away then very less books will be read. But the more books read and understood, more books will be wrote and published. The same has to do with music, movies, magazines, etc, they all are made for a reason and should be checked out. It is great to learn about different things by reading, listening, reviewing, etc, even the things people may find offensive, they may teach lessons, so censoring access to these materials limits opportunities for growth and understanding.
689	3666	2	3	Going to the library, you would think of it as a family environment, wouldn't you? I know that when I think of the library I do not think of offensive material that would make anyone upset. Surprisingly, many libraries do have such material, and I do not think that they should be allowed to, since the library is not aimed just for adults. Children love to go to the library to check out books and many other things that they enjoy, but a five-year-old does not need to see a movie, a book, or anything else for that matter discriminating against another gender or another race. These materials should not be able to sit upon the shelves no matter what the writers say if they are putting someone down. The writers or the library owners wouldn't let their own children read it, so why should it be okay for someone else's child to read or watch it? I'm not the only one who thinks this; I am sure that there are millions of people like me that would not appreciate their loved ones finding these things and reading them.  The information that young ones see or hear while they are still young will carry on with them throughout their life; who knows what they will do or think when they are old enough. These places are supposed to be a family place where you can go to get information, not for someone to pick up on violence, drugs, racism, and any other derogatory subjects. Young kids are not the only ones that should not be reading these corrupted materials; teenagers and adults are more likely to understand it better and take the subjects into account.  I am begging these library owners to please take these offensive materials out of their branches; not only because small children could see them, but adults do not need to be reading, listening, or watching these things either. If you would not want your child to, why would anyone else want their child to? Libraries should be places of learning and positive growth for everyone, not sources of potentially harmful content.
690	3667	2	3	Why should they take them off the shelves? If you ask me I think they should leave @CAPS1 up there. I think they should leave @CAPS1 up there. Not only is @CAPS1 happening in the libraries it's happening on televisions also. Everything in the library might not offend some people. Some people take @CAPS1 offensive when they see something that's against their religion, culture, or maybe their country. But we have the people that take certain things in the library offensive but don't worry about @CAPS1. I say, 'If you check out the library and find something that you take offensive, don't get @CAPS1 just because you don't like @CAPS1 doesn't mean other people won't like @CAPS1. So why waste time trying to fight to get @CAPS1 off the shelves when @CAPS1's really you the only person worried about @CAPS1?' @CAPS1 just doesn't make any sense how people put up a fit because a certain material offended them. Like someone said a pastor was on TV, talking about how bad hell really is since some people don't think @CAPS1's not going to be all that bad. He was on TV at the time and this lady got offensive about @CAPS1 and had them take him off TV. But she didn't have to watch him on TV, she could of watched something else. Nobody made her watch @CAPS1, she chose to watch @CAPS1, so she should have just changed the channel. So what I'm saying is that just like the author of the newspaper said, 'I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor, then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' @CAPS2 that if you want something off the shelf, think about the other people that actually want to use @CAPS1 rather than thinking about just you. It's a matter of respecting everyone's choices and recognizing that personal offense shouldn't dictate what's available for everyone else.
691	3668	2	3	Libraries are great for multiple reasons. A library is the place to go if you need to do research, meet with a tutor, find an interesting book to read, find that one song you've been looking for, or pick out a new movie to rent for tonight. However within a library there are limits toward what they offer and what you can get. Censorship in libraries is a topic that comes up every now and then, and people will debate over whether they think censorship is a good or bad thing to have. Personally, I think that censorship can just be more inconvenient for some. For example, when I was in the ninth grade I was assigned to do a research paper over cults. However this topic turned out to be a challenge to research because the libraries I went to did not offer many books or resources over cults because it is seen as an 'inappropriate' or 'offensive' topic. Also, the librarians wouldn't let me check out some of the books because of my age. Since they thought that I was too young to be reading that information, they weren't going to let me proceed with my research. I think that if it's something going on in the world we live in, then it might as well be available for the public to access. If there are people who wish to not see or hear about certain topics, then they can take it upon themselves to avoid it, rather than just getting rid of it altogether. The same goes for any form of media. If there is a T.V. show that you don't like, don't watch it. If there is a song that you dislike, then don't listen to it. It is that easy. I know I do it all the time. People need to take it upon themselves and understand what they can and cannot handle, and then apply that to their daily lives. When it comes to children, and censoring certain topics from them, I think that it is up to the guardians of the child to determine what is O.K. and not O.K. for them to see or hear. Then it is the responsibility of the guardians to make sure that their rules, or guidelines, are set and the child understands what they are. In conclusion, I think the purpose of a library is to offer information, any information. Then people go to that library to find the information that they are looking for, with the wide selection the library has to offer. I think that libraries shouldn't have to feel responsible for censoring items that may be offensive; it is their job to just offer information.
692	3669	2	3	"I do not think books should be censored from the shelves of library's. Katherine is correct in many ways. We would not have any books if everyone removed the ones they disliked. The world would lose a lot of information on important things in their worlds. I'm writing this to explain why I don't think books should be censored. I don't think books should be removed if they are offensive to some people because they, sometimes, help people see the errors in their ways, like a book about glorifying the way white men and women treated BLACK men and women. Nowadays, people would read that book and if they were racist they wouldn't be after that book, because they see how wrong RACISM is. Music is freedom of speech; some artists see themselves as 'liberators', 'idols', and even 'love spreading'. Yes, there are some songs that could 'seem' offensive, but you'll never know how high a TREE will grow if you cut it down. In example, the song titled ""Like a Prayer"" by Madonna, has Catholic churches furious because they automatically assume she's disrespecting GOD when in reality she's speaking a whole different tone. People learn special, powerful life lessons from things or situations that are shunned by our society, and DISCRIMINATION will probably always remain that way, we don't know. But one thing we do know is we can change what we do in the present and better what we're going to do in the future, meaning that censorship ultimately hinders our potential for growth and understanding."
693	3670	2	3	Libraries are places that you can get a book. You should be encouraged to be like others. If you are one person, you have every right to get any book you want. I believe that there should not be anything to stop people from reading. So I believe that they should stop telling us lies by taking the books off the shelves. Ultimately, ensuring access to literature is crucial for an informed and empowered citizenry.
694	3671	2	3	No, because all you have to do is ignore it or not pay any attention to it and it shouldn't bother you that much. Most people might look at something and think it is interesting, like something that happened on the news lately and was published on newspapers or put on the internet. For example, the @LOCATION1 story, that has been on the news for the past week, people think that it is awesome that he was finally found and killed. If people found that offensive that might be because they don't know what he did or weren't around when it happened. If they took down stuff that was offensive then we would have nothing interesting to read. If someone found a movie that was racist then don't get it, just put it back and find something else like a romance or a comedy. Everybody could use a laugh every once and a while. For music if your friend recommends something to you, check it out on the internet first to see if it is any good, if not then tell them no and that you find it offensive. If they were a true friend then they would understand and perhaps make it up to you with something else. Magazines, from what I know don't really have anything offensive in them. The only thing they have are some pictures, gossip, facts, and some stories that might peak your interest. Books might have some things that you find offensive but, if you like the book so much you might as well finish it. If you found a book that you really like then read through it a bit or check it out on the internet to see what is about. Out of all the books I have read, I have found none of them offensive they were all good books, books that I would probably read again if I wanted to, but I won't, because I'm lazy. Newspapers are interesting to read and might have little to none offensive remarks in them. Some might pertain to blacks or mexicans, something like that. Well I haven't read any like that yet but, I have heard some things about it. In the newspapers there might be little comics or gags that would probably be more offensive than anything in the newspapers. Ultimately, I think that if you find something offensive then just ignore it and move on to something else instead of throwing a fit about it, because that wouldn't do well at all.
695	3672	2	3	There are so many things these days that people find offensive, in so many different places in magazines, books, movies, cell phones, on the internet, even some words in songs. Some people find it so offensive that they think they should be able to remove these offending materials off the shelf. A big thing for parents in this situation is what if my child gets ahold of this? I don't want them reading this! What if it messes up their childhood? Honestly parents, if you don't want your young child to read these things or see these pictures then why take them to these places where it is at? On the occasion that they do get ahold of it, then sit down with them and talk to them about it so they understand that it's something they should not be associated with.  Also, if everyone took things off the shelf that they found inappropriate then we wouldn't have anything left to read, listen to, or watch. A lot of times, one thing that someone finds funny could offend another person to no end. For example, @PERSON1 could find something very enjoyable, but @PERSON2 could find the very same thing extremely offending. This would lead to many arguments among our communities, creating division and strife where common ground once existed.  Yet there is still another reason that this would not work out well, and would not be a good idea. If this were to happen then kids would grow up thinking that this is an easy world. This world is harsh and not easy at all times. Kids learn a lot of this through the media. As long as we have positive role models to explain to kids that what they see in some of the media is wrong, and they should not take part in it, then why would it need to be removed? The presence of guidance and open discussion is key.  If people were able to do this then the communities would have a lot more crime from anger, we would have nothing left to read watch or see, and kids would live a very confused life not knowing what to expect from the media. So now I ask you, what do you think? It seems clear that allowing open access, paired with responsible guidance, is the best path forward for a well-informed and understanding society.
696	3673	2	3	From my point of view, if materials such as books are offensive to a reader, the reader should simply leave the book alone, because other readers might want to read it. The same goes for music, movies, magazines, or anything else; just because you find something offensive, it isn't right to take it away from thousands or more people who might enjoy it. Also, I think if something is offensive to more than one person, it shouldn't just be taken away immediately. We, as people, should step up and have a vote or talk about the problem and consider the various perspectives. It wouldn't be right for us, or to the rest of the world, to remove something without careful consideration, especially when you look at how much work the author had to put in; I've never written a book, but I know it's not easy to do. Here's an example: my family wanted to eat out, but we didn't know where. Everybody was thinking about pizza, but my big brother didn't want to, so we didn't go out to eat that night because of one person's preference; that's not fair, is it? So, in my conclusion, I don't think it would be right to take something away because somebody found it offensive; you just have to consider the rest of the world, because it wouldn't be right to the rest of us, who might appreciate or value that material.
697	3674	2	3	The content of a library should be full of various material even if one might find certain materials offensive. Just because someone might think a material is offensive does that mean we just ignore the subject, forgeting it altogether? Some subjects might be awkward to talk about, read about, or even think about, but that doesn't mean we should ingnore them. One subject that might be awkward to read about is sexually transmitted diseases. You often see people walking through the library skimming through the aisles, once in a while opening a book to see what it's about, but when they come to the section on sexually transmitted diseases they just walk on by, to uncomfortable to be seen in the area. It's not a subject that people normally read for fun, but everyone should be aware of it. There are many subjects like this that everyone should be aware even if you think it doesn't effect you.  Another reason to keep all books in the library is to be informed of history. Some history might be gruesome and completely crazy, but we should be aware of those things and not forgot about them. The HOLOCAUST for example. That was a very dark period in history. Over six million people died becasuse just one person didn't like what they believed in. It's sometimes hard to read about, but you should be aware of what happened in the past no matter how depressing it is. We should be aware to prevent another event like that from happening.  People's likes in music vary. There are so many different types and styles of music. Some music might be offensive to other people, but does that mean you should get rid of it at the library? The library should always have a large variety of different music. Often people would like to widen there music intellect and the library is the perfect place to do that.  Everyone is different. We never all like the same thing. Taking materials from the library to avoid the subject doesn't stop someone from finding that information. If people wanted information and they couldn't find it at the library they would most likely find another way to get that information. Having a vary in books, music, movies, and magazines make what the library is, a place to learn new things, no matter the subject, and ensures access to a wide spectrum of knowledge and perspectives.
698	3675	2	3	You're watching a movie on TV that you and your friend have seen in theaters. You both love the movie and just as it gets close to the best part, the TV skips over that part because people think that that scene is inappropriate. Censorship is good, but sometimes it is too strict when it comes to movies, music, and books. Some of the movies that are popular will end up on TV for the viewers entertainment, some movies have scenes that are a little inappropriate, and even though it's not that offensive, the TV companies will cut that scene out of it. Also, if there is bad language in the movie, they will take that word out and replace it with another word that makes no sense with what the movie is trying to say. Censorship tends to ruin the movies that most people love. The TV companies even censor historical movies, which can alter the intended message. If it's a historical movie, it shouldn't be censored because it takes away from the true story.  Music is another item that tends to get censored quite often. With music, if there is a bad word, the word is just skipped over or bleeped out which makes the song sound strange. Most songs are censored because parents don't want their children to listen to it. I don't think music should be censored just for little kids. If the parents don't want their children to hear those words, they shouldn't let their children listen to that kind of music; parents should be responsible for monitoring what their children listen to.  Books tend to be censored and even banned at schools. Not too many children read books anymore so if they do decide to read a book, we should let them read what they want because reading helps the mind. Some schools banned books because of inappropriate language. That is unfair because some books are beautifully written, but children can't read them because of language. Also, some books are censored because they are too detailed when it comes to certain scenes dealing with sex and crime. Some books are just too good to be banned.  A lot of things seem to be censored in this world. We should have censorship, but it shouldn't be so strict when it comes to movies, music, and books, as excessive censorship can diminish the artistic merit and historical accuracy of these works.
699	3676	2	3	The library is meant to be a place that is filled with materials of all different genres and types. Many of us go to the library because we are looking for something in particular, rather than just browsing. Although some materials that people need to research at the library might be considered inappropriate for certain audiences, it still serves as a useful resource for others. This might include getting information for a research paper, renting a movie that needs to be watched for school, or looking for a certain type of book to read. By taking certain books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves, we are limiting the amount of materials for people to borrow. At many schools, students are asked to write research papers. What is considered a valid subject for a high school research paper might include information that is not suitable for all groups of people. A student might write a research paper on the effects a certain drug has on an individual. Just because the student chooses this topic, does not mean that he or she supports it. Some adults might say that information on drugs should not be on the shelves in a library because it might include material that they consider graphic, but a student looks at this material only as a resource for an educational purpose. My freshman year we read *The Odyssey* and Homer. We also watched the movie to get a better understanding of the differences between our time periods. There is death and violence in the movie, along with a brief flash of nudity. Many would consider even this great literary work as a movie inappropriate. The movie helped us to get a real life picture of how things were back then. We were mature enough to look past the graphic scenes and see the movie for what it really was. If this move was taken off the shelf, some people wouldn't have fully understood the story because they couldn't picture it. Sometimes, we just want a good book to read. Many teens gravitate to the young adult section because it includes age-related material. Many books in this section might include works that have a dark or graphic theme with subjects that are inappropriate for younger children. If we eliminated books from this section because they are being censored, we will end up with even less teens that read. Certain books provide an escape for some teens, and might even help them to confront or deal with problems in their own lives. If libraries start censoring books we might end up with less and less readers as the years go on. Instead of censoring the books, we should censor the people reading the books. If a parent doesn't want a younger child to read about a certain topic, then they should keep them away from that material. Libraries can put age approval marks on certain books to permit only certain age groups to read them. Authors of the books should not be punished for what they choose to write about by taking their books out of the library. No matter what a person's purpose for reading is, they should have a choice of what kind of material the book contains, and limiting access through censorship ultimately hinders intellectual exploration and personal growth.
700	3677	2	3	There are thousands of books in libraries, which are inappropriate and some that are. But libraries are to learn about many things such as reading for fun, reading the newsletter, or just looking for random information. Libraries are places that we refer to when we need to find historical moments, or about animals or anything else. We need all books because they teach us the past, they all have a purpose, and we become more intelligent. I believe that all books in a library have a purpose. They might be offensive but they teach us many things. For example, there are books out there that talk about the Holocaust. For some people this might be a touchy subject and some might take it offensively, but if we didn't have those books to learn from we would make the same mistakes as we did back then. Books can teach us so much about the past, we can learn so many things from books then anywhere else in the world. I also think that all books have a purpose to them, whether they are fiction or nonfiction. You might ask 'how do fiction books have purpose?' Well, fiction books have a purpose because they teach us to really use our imagination, quite a bit of books make us realize that the struggles of a character can be the same struggles of someone in real life. And the most important reason is because fiction books not only catch our attention, but they also catch our children's attention. Fiction books are the first books children know how to read, this is where they start their reading skills. My last reason for why I don't think 'offensive' books shouldn't be removed from shelves is because all books make us more intelligent. We learn so much information from all sorts of books. Another example would be, that medical books could be 'offensive' as well, but if we didn't have them we would not have intelligent doctors. My final reason why I disagree with books being removed if they aren't suited for everyone is that someone that wants to learn something wouldn't be able to because what they want to learn could be offensive to others. What I mean by this is that we would pretty much be telling that person that they are not able to learn something new because others think it's offensive. Every human being has a different outlook on something that could be offensive or could not. But why should we remove books, magazines, movies, etc from shelves? Just because we don't like it doesn't mean we have to remove it. Everyone has different taste, we won't ever agree on anything. But removing books from shelves isn't fair to anyone. Yes, they might be unsuited for others but when we don't like something don't we just move along to something we do like? Yes we do, so we should do the same thing with books, allowing everyone the freedom to choose what they read and learn from, even if some find it objectionable.
701	3678	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. If you are reading, listening, or watching any of these things and a part is offensive to you, then simply don't engage with it. Why continue if you believe it's offensive? Put it down and forget about it; you have the choice not to consume it. It is your own fault if you are offended by something you voluntarily choose to read or watch.  It seems rare for things to be written with the intention of offending lately anyway. As I said before, if you are reading, watching, or whatever it is, then it is your own fault if you are offended. When someone states they have been offended, people just get rid of that thing and tear it away from our lives. I am writing today to stop the people who are ruining other people's lives by getting rid of what other people like to do.  If you believe that you should take away our fun and pleasure of doing these things, then do it, but remember what you're taking away from those who like to read all of that. If you get rid of the books that keep us entertained, then there will be nothing left on the shelves for any of us.  I have written in this newspaper of things that should be left alone. I have also written about if you do take away our simple things we like to read, just think about what you're taking away from those who read, listen, or watch these things. Consider carefully what I have said, and remember the impact censorship has on those who enjoy these materials, goodnight.
702	3679	2	3	Libraries shouldn't remove books. I would like to start off this story by stating I don't believe that libraries should remove books if they are offensive. If a book is offensive, that's not a reason to take it off the shelves; we watch movies in school today showing the past when America had slaves.  I myself don't believe it is fair to show a movie in school about slavery, but we can't have a book that doesn't actually show anything to us, just tells us what's going on. In my eyes, a book is less harmless than watching a show on the subject. A movie can show a lot more detail in it than a book can, so I say let the books stay where they are. Don't try to shut down an author because you don't like what they wrote; there might be more meaning in the book than you can see. Just keep reading; you never know how the story might go on. Just like, don't judge a book by its cover.  We can't take away a book someone might like. Someone might hate the book, but because they hate it, would you quit reading it? I don't believe it is right to remove something because someone might not like what it is saying. I myself see a lot of things I don't like every day, but I do not try getting everything changed. This is life as I know it; there are a lot of offensive people in this world, and it won't change anytime soon, not for me or anyone, unless they make a law against being offensive.  I can see someone in a band saying something offensive about someone, but we can't not sell his CDs because someone might like what he said in that song. Or I don't like a lot of shows and or movies on TV, but I don't try to get the station shut down; I just change the channel. As should, let's say, someone in a bookstore sees an offensive book; they should just look away and not go and try to get it shut down.  All I can really say, though, is that I couldn't tell you what I would do because I don't read very many books, so I don't see them being offensive. So I cannot tell you I wouldn't be mad, but I still would just put the book down and not touch it again. Therefore, I firmly believe that the choice of whether or not to engage with a book should rest with the individual reader.
703	3680	2	3	I will be talking about whether books, music, or even magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive. In my opinion I don't think books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive to some people, because not all people have the same interests. First of all I think things shouldn't be removed from library shelves just because some people don't like the items and get offended. The people who do like the item, say an explicit song, would probably buy it. But also the people who don't like the explicit song would get offended and would want it off the shelves, which is unfair to those who enjoy it. Another example can be a book. What if a person didn't like what he/she read and gets offended? They would return the book and wouldn't want it sold anymore and wouldn't mention it to a friend. But another person comes along and picks the same book and did like what he/she read, and that person would probably recommend it to a friend. The same way goes for a magazine also. What if a person gets offended at an advertisement? If a person likes it and returns it, then comes along another person who gets offended at it and doesn't like it, it shouldn't stop selling for that particular person. In conclusion I think things in the library shouldn't stop selling because one person gets offended at it; they could have chosen not to look at the item in the first place. Ultimately, libraries should aim to cater to diverse tastes and interests, even if some material is considered offensive by certain individuals.
704	3681	2	3	Books are books we all read them and summary's over them. To find what we need to know in the past or future or mainly whats going on todays life. So we shouldnt take books off the shelfs just like magizens. They might have information to tell people around the world. Thats why people make books and magizens so people like us can read them while were notbusy in life or just relaxin. People read bad stuff all the time in books or magizens thats what life is about cause there's some good stuff and there are some bad stuff to read about in life. I mean hey if you dont want your children readin them than have them not read at all. Because more they age the more there going to know whats going on in life. There's stuff thats bad like you cant really stop them. When there at that age in there life so there going to find out some how or another. Cause there are schools that have alot of reading to talk about good stuff that might be important for there future's. Schools are mainly why kids know what they know now because you got all your history clases. That talk about slavery and every thing els thats bad. When kids say it outta class rooms they get in trouble.  So if they get in trouble outta class then why do would you teach it or even say it. These are important lessons. History classes are very helpfull because they teach you about all the different wars. That has happend and who invaded other countrys or states. They help out on findin places on a maps. That shows all the wolds state and countrys and even where we live in our country.  So really why would u take stuff off the shelfs if other people read them. Mainly why would you do it since other people have worked very hard and there time makin books. Then have them published for you to just take them off the shelf. What if they wanted to do that to you if you wrote maybe some bad stuff in a little writing. Whats the harm in it anyway, especially considering the effort and potential value these works hold for others seeking knowledge or relaxation?
705	3682	2	3	For as long as people can remember books have been banned for various reasons. Whether it be a time of war or a religious restriction, it is always viewed as a negative thing and therefore should be no different today. Though it may be a bit less extreme, books or content such as movies, music, or magazines should not be removed from library shelves based on someone else's opinion. It is a right to be able to obtain the information these materials offer. No material should ever be removed from a public library based on censorship. Some may argue that certain material may be offensive to other groups of people, but who is it to judge how another feels. Material is written or made to show the feelings of the author and how they want their feelings or knowledge portrayed. The author is merely taking advantage of their freedom of speech. It is at the responsibility of the public to how they use the information they receive. It is still a piece of history and was recorded for a reason. Religion is always a hot point when it comes to censorship, but is that not in our constitution. Freedom of religion includes how we interpret and study our religions. Most have holy books and writings. Many express their religion by means of music and culture. It is a right for the public to be able to access this material. There are some rare situations when restrictions may need to be upheld but merely based on age. This however doesn't restrict the public, but offers parents the right to censor what information their children are able to get ahold of. An age limit on specific types of material could be added in the cases of sexual content, vulgar images, or disturbing content unsuitable for children. This way information is never censored completely. It is never right to tell people what they can or can not know. It is a part of the very structure of our country to allow all information to be shared freely. Censorship of these materials is not and never will be the answer. Although, age restrictions may be an answer for younger citizens these materials aren't taken away from the public. Whatever it may be called, book banning or censorship, it is a negative thing and should not be a part of our public library systems.
706	3683	2	3	Should there be censorship in libraries? People think that there should be and some think it shouldn't matter. I think there shouldn't be because maybe some people like those books. I have three reasons why there shouldn't be censorship. My reasons are first people like certain books and should be able to get what ever they want. Second, the libraries should be able to put what ever they want on the shelfs. Third, if you don't like what the books say then don't get the book.  Libraries have many books for you to choose from and you can pick which book you want to check out. Libraries don't need to censor their books because some people might want books like that. Everybody has there own preference on the kinds of books and music that they like. Censorship wouldn't allow them to get what they want which would make them mad. There is all kinds of genres of books and music around, some have more strong language in them then other genres. Some people like their music uncensored and should be able to get it. Libraries and entertainment stores are the ones who buy the books and music not you. They should be allowed to cater to diverse tastes.  Libraries have the freedom to get what ever books they want to and put them on shelves. If you don't like what certain books or music say then go get something you do like. There is no rule that says you have to get a certain kind of music. Some people like the music genre called rap which does have some strong language in it but its your choice to listen to it. the stores just put the products on the shelf to make money not to get you angry about what the products say. There are sections on the shelves that say what genre they are. Stores are businesses that need to offer a variety of choices.  People that want to say something about what the language is like in the book should not have checked it out. You have the right to ask what certain music, books, or movies are like, and movies have ratings on the case. Music and movies have ratings which tell you how strong the language is on the cases. People can not say to monitor that when it tells you everything thats in the movie or music. The libraires and stores usually mark the sections on what genre they are. That can tell you where the uncensored parts are. You can stay away from those sections if you find them offensive. Responsible choices lie with the individual consumer.  The libraries should not have to censor there books and entertainment store should not need to censor all the music and movies. Its your choice what to get not theirs. People can stay away from those areas that they find offensive. Everybody should be able to get what they want even if it might offend others, and libraries and stores should not be forced to limit their selection based on the preferences of a few.
707	3684	2	3	It's frustrating when you're watching a movie and unexpected scenes pop up that you don't want your kids to see. Telling them to constantly close their eyes or cover their ears isn't ideal. Parents deserve a better heads-up about potentially objectionable content in movies. Knowing beforehand about specific behaviors ensures that parents are able to know if the movie is suitable for their child's age and maturity level. A simple, clear label indicating the presence of potentially inappropriate material in movies, books, and magazines would be a game-changer. This way, parents can make informed decisions and protect their children from content they deem unsuitable, ultimately empowering them to do what they believe is best.
708	3685	2	3	I think that a library should be just books because that what they are made for. If we started putting movies in the librarys why put books in the libraries. I think it should be one or the other. If movies were in libraries i think that people would get more movies than books, and just think how it would be if you put music in a library also. I do think that a magazine is a book. Movies should stay in a movie store of at the movie theater. not in libraries. Music should stay on the radio or in stores not in libraries. People would lose intrest in books if people started putting movies and music in libraries. I think they are trying to put technology in libraries and im not for that. If music and movies were at libraries their would be no need for books and people would stop buying books. We need books they are the oldest but most acreart way to express yourself or tell a story. but now they want movies or music. The introduction of other media formats, while perhaps intended to modernize libraries, would ultimately detract from their primary purpose of preserving and promoting literature. Therefore, libraries should remain dedicated to books, ensuring their continued importance in our society.
709	3686	2	3	Censorship The topic I am going to discuss today is censorship. Do you think that censorship is a good thing or a bad thing? I am going to list a couple of ways that i think censorship is bad and also why it is good. The first thing I am going to talk to you about is how it is bad. The bad part about censorship is that it can offend people very easily. Most people can handle alot of abuse, but on the otherhand alot of people can't.  In my oppinion I think that it is fine to have some things out that offend people because that is how alot of people find humor. Such as political cartoon. They make fun of the politicians and alot of the other people that are in office, but you dont see them complaining about it. In my oppinion if you dont like it then dont read it. That is all you have to do and then it will never bother you again.  But on the other hand i can see how some people can get offended because some of the things are very mean in books and movies. I think that there should be some type of line that seperates going to fare and what is good enough. most people can live with it, but others can't. Such as racism, there is a whole lot of racism in the United States, and expecally in this time period. where ever you go there is always some sort of racism.  In conclusion I think that people need to get together and create a line that can be drawn befor they get to far and some of the stuff now needs to be taking off of the shelves, but not everything, so we need to come to an agreement on where that line should be placed.
710	3687	2	3	Books, movies, magazines, music, and most of all, life. We all know whats wrong, and what's right. Every school is different. Some schools have limits on their books, such as if you're two years old, and reading something like @PERSON1, then that's gonna be inappropriate. If you're sixteen and reading a @PERSON2 book, then that's too inappropriate for their age limit. Every age is different, so your not going to find some forty-three year old hobo on the streets reading, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS1' by @PERSON2. Most likely, he'll be reading a mystery book, or something appropriate for his age not for someone that's five. Books shouldn't be banned because some elementary mother doesn't want her seven year old reading '@CAPS4'. Just because some mothers want it banned, doesn't mean it should be. Be smarter and watch what your kids are reading, it shouldn't have to be banned from other children just because you don't want your kid reading it.  Don't we all agree that music is life? Not everyone has to listen to rap, nor do they have to listen to opera. Don't you see that we have musical artist in the world that depend on music? So why should rap be banned just because it talks about killing, drugs, and drinking. I say who cares? Don't listen to it if you don't like it, it doesn't mean you have to ruin it for everyone else. I love all kinds of music, so nothing should be banned. In my opinion I hate christian songs, I think they're too slow, and constantly talking about @CAPS5, but that doesn't mean I should ruin it for everyone else, just because I hate it. Everyone is different, no one is the same. Music helps me gets through life, and I know it helps you get through yours too, it shouldn't be banned.  Movies, movies, movies! Video games, video games, video games! We all love cuddling and watching movies together, but not all movies are right for us. Movies have ratings like video games do. Ratings show what's appropriate for a twelve year old verses a twenty-five year old. Adults would most likely be playing a rated @CAPS6 game, and watching rated @CAPS7 movies. Little kids about the age of six would be playing rated @CAPS8 games, and watching rated @CAPS9 movies. As you can see everyone is different especially when it comes to these things. Rated @CAPS7 movies usually have gore, sexual themes, strong language, and things little kids should never watch. It doesn't mean it should be banned, maybe blocked in your home, but not banned.  In my opinion, I think all movies, books, music, video games, etc., shouldn't be banned. Instead, all of these forms of media should be carefully watched to see who's hands it lands into, and who's eyes are viewing it. We should be responsible enough to pick out the material for ourselves; no one should tell me what not to read or watch: unless I am a youth, in which case the material should be supervised by my parents.
711	3688	2	3	Censorship in libraries? That could be a good and a bad thing. Is it really that big of a deal for kids to see some bad things in books? Will authors remove their books from libraries? Censorship in Libraries is not as needed as most people think. Children nowadays know a lot of things and are intelligent about certain subjects. I understand parents don't want their children to read books containing drugs, violence, sex, etc. They're going to have to learn about it sometime in their life though. They might as well get a head start on it now. Young children most of the time are not even interested in going to those kinds of books anyway. If you censor all the books in the libraries then some students would be in trouble on projects they might need those kinds of books for. Say I needed a book on 'violence' for a project I'm doing in history class. If the books are censored then I would have no sources to get information from. On the other hand, I can see why adults would want the books censored. No parent wants their child coming home from school talking about sex, and drugs they saw in a book at school. If I was a parent I would be concerned myself. If it's that big of a deal to some adults then what are they going to do when their children see the same stuff only worse on t.v. Commercials about condoms, and advertisements telling them to use drugs/violence. At least with books, the book is teaching you about the drug and how dangerous it is for you. If one author takes their book off the shelf because they don't want children reading it, then that gives all authors the right to do the same. Which could mean that we would have no books on the shelves for anybody. Books are a key to learning! We need to keep ALL books in the libraries no matter how explicit they are. Parents should sit down and talk with their children about not picking up those kinds of books if they don't want their child reading them. Yes, I have seen people pick those books up and start making jokes about them, but that's what children do when they're immature. You have to expect that from kids nowadays. No matter how bad they are they're informational books and we need them to learn, and therefore, censorship in libraries should be approached with caution and careful consideration for the educational benefits that these resources offer.
712	3689	2	3	NO, I do not think that books, music, magizines and etc. should be removed from the shelves if found offensive. Books help people in many ways. Music helps people find their activity in many ways. Also magizines helps people do things thats meant to be done. The reason I said books help people is because it furthers one knowledge to understand things better. It also hepls one vocabulary more stronger than it once was. Last but not least it helps people become more focused and when saying that I mean that it makes you understand how to be focused on the main idea and the whole concept of the book. When people read and they don't understand what they are reading, they look further to try and understand the words they misunderstood which is good because you will learn alot more then you thought you did. Music is also a very good thing to use because it make people calm when they have had an long stressful day at work, school, doctor, or etc. Music also helps you look into your creativity which means you want to do more things such as dance, sing, or some even start to paint. When im tired and I have had a long day , I like to go home and lay down and listen to music and that is because I feel relaxed and more calmer. Last but not least, magizines. Magizines gives you alot of information that one might be seeking for. Just say that you were looking for a recipe and you don't have an computer and you have magizines, you can look and a magizine and see when was this recipe effective and by whom it was wrote. Also if you were to want to order some things such as shoes, clothes, perfume fragrances, lotions and some even order house hold things if needed. When I look in a magizine,I like to order shoes or even just compare the prices of something store bought or the magizine price. There are many different things you can look foward to when looking in a magizine. So take my advive and try it because sometimes what your'e looking for can be right in your library. With all that being sad books, music, and magizines can be very helpful to you and any body else. Books are very helpful when it comes to essays or etc. Music is very useful when youv'e had a long day at your place of buisness or etc. Magizines are very self explanatory when it comes to food, clothing, shoes, topics , essays ,cars ,houses or etc. When you have a question or a concern or maybe even a doubt you can go to your nearest own personal library and borrow or read a book, magizine or listen to a little music. All these things can be helpful and all you have to do is take in it and take advantage of free information that is given to you. All of these things can help you in a way, so it is important to preserve access to these resources.
713	3690	2	3	People are often offensive to others in various ways. It shouldn't matter if someone dislikes a book because someone else might enjoy it. Books, music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media will inevitably be disliked by some, which is a normal part of life. In my opinion, having books that some people dislike is a positive thing. It indicates whether people are engaged with the world and care about what others write or say.  However, there's a line that should be considered when writing a movie or even local newspaper articles. Sometimes, the content goes too far. I believe there should be a limit on what can be written, and the writer should use their best judgment to determine that limit.  Some people complain about truthful messages because they don't want their past or tragic experiences to be revealed. Perhaps if someone talked to them, they wouldn't be so angry about the truth being shared. You've heard my perspective on people getting upset about what others say, and I believe that freedom of speech is very important in this country. So, while disagreement and dislike are natural, responsible writing and open communication are crucial for navigating these differences effectively.
714	3691	2	3	Censorship seems like a great idea at first thought! It allows parents to have their children closely monitored without actually monitoring them. Consequently, censorship in libraries creates the possibilty for every book ever written to be removed from shelves around the world. There are multiple things wrong with the idea of censorship. It creates objections due to differences in opinions and autors being completely and uterly offended. Censorship is a disgrace and should not be forced in libraries.  People have different criteria when it comes to deciding a level of offensiveness. For intsense, if a fifty-year-old female read a violent book with some curse words and sexual content she might think that it was offensive. Likewise, if a twenty-one-year-old, careless male read the exact same book he would probably enjoy its content. This defference in opinion poses as a huge problem in allowing libraries to censor their selecion. I feel that it would be unfair to remove books that some audiences would enjoy.  Instead of completely banning some texts, why not move them to another section of the library? Libraries could take some time to separate the books into categories and the books that they feel are offensive could go into a separate section of the library. This section could be as simple a separate shelf, or could go to the extreme of a separate room or area closed in by a curtain. Either way, completely getting rid of books because of their content is a terrible idea.  Authors could potentially lose money from the action of censorship. They put in numberous hours and a lot of effort to write books and novels. Some spend years trying to perfect their masterpieces. Magazines and movies provide the same amount of time, but they also aquire an unimagineable amount of money. If these authors, directors, and producers have their specific product taken off of the shelves it would be offensive to them. They could have a decrease in sales which would cause a decrease in money as well. The idea is simply unfair.  Librarians have the right to display the content of which they choose, but making them remove products that they feel are fine is ridiculous. I think that censorship is a terrible idea. If anything should be banned from a library it should be censorship itself! Ultimately, limiting access to information through censorship hinders intellectual growth and disregards the diverse perspectives that enrich our society, making its implementation in libraries a truly detrimental practice.
715	3692	2	3	I have often observed individuals expressing unconventional theories, and it's true that everyone is entitled to their own beliefs. While differing viewpoints are acceptable, striving for mutual understanding is crucial. I believe that censorship in libraries plays a vital role, but it's equally important to cultivate empathy, overcome stubbornness, and consider diverse perspectives to foster smoother interpersonal relationships. Libraries contain a wide range of materials, some of which are subject to greater censorship than others. Censorship often stems from the presence of strong, potentially controversial ideas. While freedom of speech allows individuals to express their beliefs, it's essential to ensure that such expression doesn't harm others. Explicit movies and music, despite rating systems, can sometimes demonstrate a lack of consideration for diverse perspectives. Misunderstandings often arise from misinterpretations of others' ideas. People struggle to see things from different points of view, leading to conflict. Increased understanding would mitigate conflicts arising from differing beliefs. Exposure to diverse perspectives broadens one's knowledge of various opinions. Stubbornness, the refusal to consider alternative viewpoints, hinders understanding. Overcoming stubbornness allows for greater awareness of others' feelings and experiences, which is essential for positive interactions. Stubbornness can make it difficult to relate to others and maintain harmonious relationships. In conclusion, censorship is necessary, but the reasons behind it are equally important. Greater understanding could lead to increased censorship of content that genuinely offends, while reducing censorship of ideas intended to inform. Cultivating understanding, embracing diverse perspectives, and overcoming stubbornness are vital for improving interpersonal relationships and fostering a more harmonious society.
716	3693	2	3	I understand how some people @MONTH1 get offended by some things they @MONTH1 watch or they might read but that doesn't mean that other people shouldn't be able to know about it because one person doesn't like it. It's kind of a matter of opinion of whether it is offensive or not. I myself have never really read or watched anything that was completely uncalled for. On just about every movie or music album that is produced they rate it so that you can know who should be watching this movie and who shouldn't. If the movie was made with somekind of offensive parts to it then they put with the rating that yes, their is some rude language and things like that. So just because somebody didn't read close enough to see that their might be something they don't like in the movie shouldn't cause everyone else to not be able to see that particular movie. Personally I don't find books to be the greatest things but I am sure of that some books or magazines do tend to have something rude or crude in them but it's not always horrible. If someone thinks that the book @MONTH1 be inapproiate for some readers then they could tell a person in charge in the library that maybe they should only be letting certain people be reading that book because of the content. You shouldn't have to throw a book off a shelf because one or two people thought bad about it. If it was me choosing whether or not to take movies, books, magazines, etc off of the shelfs I wouldn't. I say this because @PERCENT1 of the time things have been rated or in someway approved to be put on general store shelfs, and this is often the final say. People can simply read details on the back and see that it's not going to bother them in a way or that it could be offensive and they shouldn't be purchasing. If someone complained about a new cd or movie that I personally wanted to see or listen to and it was taken off shelfs I would be upset about it because it probley wouldn't even offened me at all. So no, I completely disagree with the idea of movies or books and music having to stop sales because two or three people were offended by it's content; individual preferences shouldn't dictate availability for everyone else.
717	3694	2	3	I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies etc. should not be removed if they are found offensive. The library has different sections for different groups like the young adult or teen section, easy children or picture book section, and the adult section. Young adult or the teen section is mainly for teenagers. They have books that a teen would normally read like young adult fiction and fantasy. The teen section also has music which teens listen to, often pop and alternative. For movies, this section has the Twilight soundtrack and other popular teen movies. This section does not have any explicit language or mature themes inappropriate for teens. The teens who go into the library actually enjoy the selection of books offered to them. It has everything most teens like to read about. There is nothing inherently offensive in this section, and thus it should not be removed. There is also a children's section called the easy or picture book section. This section is for the younger children, those that are not yet in school or are in the early stages of schooling. The books, music, and movies in this section are cartoons and animals; things that children would like to read, listen, or watch. For movies, this section has movies like Strawberry Shortcake, Arthur, even Lilo and Stitch. Everything in this section is made for children; there is not one thing in this section that a child or parent would think is offensive. The library also has a section for adults. The adult section is there to catch adults' eyes. It is separate from the teen and children's sections. It is located at the other end of the library. If there is an adult who thinks that something is offensive, they have the right to talk to someone who works at the library. Most adults do not have a problem with the items in their section. The library keeps the adults' section stocked with things that adults would want to look for, like bestsellers and classic literature. It would not have something little children would want. The entire library is split up into different sections. It is easy for the children to look at books for them and for adults to do the same. There are only a few sections that I named, but every age group has a specific spot at the library. If there is something found offensive to some people, I don't think it should be removed because it might just be in the wrong section. The library takes great precaution with the censorship of their books, movies, music, etc., and if something is deemed offensive, it may simply need to be relocated, not removed entirely, to ensure all patrons have access to a diverse range of materials appropriate for their age group.
718	3695	2	3	When people think of libraries, they picture this cold place with an old mad lady telling you to be quiet. Or they just picture books everywhere. But libraries today have become way more improved and advanced with music, movies, and etc. When I was young, I never really liked libraries because they seemed boring to me. That's why I wasn't good at reading either until I was in the sixth grade because I discovered the library was actually a cool place. They had different things to do like look up books, music, or movies you can check out. Or sometimes, you might have magazines you can check out too.  Then at the libraries, there are people who don't like it because of the music, movies, and etc. This reason is because they are used to it being quiet in libraries and not full of kids and teens. That's why the faithful and ones who go to the libraries every day take the new things as offensive to the library.  When it all boils down, this topic makes me think about To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because it was an offensive book talking about how the whites treated the negroes back then. The reason I say that is because old traditions in the library are like the whites in the story, and the new things in the library are like the negroes who were outcasted by the whites. Then in the book, it took one little girl to settle differences and know what's right and wrong.  That's why I think instead of banning or removing stuff, we should have discussions, through which we can come to an agreement to keep new ideas in the libraries. When we do keep the ideas, maybe we can make a section for those new ideas so the people who come to the library wouldn't get offended, allowing us to respect both the old and the new.
719	3696	2	3	
720	3697	2	3	I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive. The main reason I say that is because there are not just positive things in this world, but there are a lot of negatives also. It is very important for children to learn and understand the things that are going on in the world they live in regardless if they are good or bad. Everyone is going to have to learn about the things going on around them sooner or later, so it is better to find it out as a child rather than later on in life when you might not have someone there to explain it all to you. I understand, there are some age limits that should be enforced because of some of the foul nature of them. Though at some point and time before a child becomes an adult they should know most of the basics of life no matter how positive or negative. Children should not be sheltered at a young age to just young adult things because they need to know what else is out there in the world. For example, children should be taught that there really are bad people in the world. If they don't understand that something bad could happen to them because they did not know the dangers around them because they never learned it. When I was younger it was required to know other people outside of your race or religion because not just your race or religion is in this world. Also we learned the difference between good and bad choices. If us children did not learn that at an early age many of them would be in some very rough situations today.  On the other hand there is an extent the children need to learn also. For example, say you buy a video game for your child, but make sure you enforce to them that killing and shooting is not something that they should be doing out in the real world. Make sure you teach them the difference between reality and fakeness. That is a main reason why kids today do not have self-control because of the things they learn off of video games. Nowadays there are people being pressured by the media to act out of their character just to get attention. They are publicizing sexual and inappropriate things for children to be learning about at a young age, but they need to be aware that it's out there and it is bad. In magazines they will distort famous people's bodies to make them look like something they are not to make people feel like they are not good enough. Children should be taught that not everything they see, hear, and read are not always right or true. With today's media and materials it is easy to know the difference between right and wrong, but they put it out there as if one person is doing it it is ok for everyone to be doing it. In most cases it is not until that person understand all of the facts about it and can make rational decisions on their own and on their own time.  Children nowadays will get pressured by media, magazines, and sometimes by peers. The media is telling them to do something that is not necessarily right, but is popular. You should not teach your children off of things like that it will make them want to do things without thinking or considering what is really going on. With today's magazines, the writers will make people look like something they really are not just to make them look good. That is not fair to readers, the person that is being exposed, or the author themself. Finally, with peer pressure today kids will see something off of television and try it then try and get their friends to do it even though they know it is not the right thing to do. I believe that children, when they are faced with dilemmas like these, should know right from wrong with the trouble they are facing. If they know nothing about it they need to walk away or learn how to say no regardless of how hard it might be.  In conclusion, I believe that the children nowadays that are exposed to any type of offensive things should know the meaning behind it. Also they should know the right ways to handle it when they are put in certain situations. Lastly, I believe kids should know what is going on around them so when they grow up they know how to fend for themselves, and not be counting on someone else to tell them basic things that are going on in the world around them.
721	3698	2	3	In today's society, there are many rap/hip-hop artists. They all sing about gangs, narcotics, alcohol, and using women for favors. Today's music is something that our children should not be exposed to at such a young age. There are children that know the words to alot of the rap songs out there. The parenting skills of some parents also reflect on if the children learn the words or not. I understand that children have to be exposed to some things in life. There are other genres of music that deal with all of the things i listed above. I dont think that it is right though for young children to learn about these things. How would you feel if your child came up to you asking what drugs are? Or what alcohol is? I also understand that we should let our kids get a little taste of the real world to see what it is like for themselves but that can only go to a certain extent. After that extent, the kids would be learning too much at such a young age.  In my personal opinion, we could let our children listen to an edited version of the songs or even chose a different genre that doesnt use those such topcis as much. Country music for example is very peaceful to me. I suggest that people listen to it because it is very realistic in ways. I also understand that rap music can be realistic in ways too. Everyone has a different outlook on what kind of music children should be allowed to listne to. I will sometimes listen to rap music but i would never allow my kids to listen to the uncensored version.  Magazines also have alot to do with why children are so 'street' smart these days. Magazines can put false information out so people will believe it. Magazine companies put revealing pictures of people on the front cover to catch someones attention. It works most of the time and children also see that. They are young and nieve so they will do what they see someone else do. That includes looking at the magazines with good looking men or women on them.  Another subject is the movies that are coming out in today's world. Movies can reveal whatever they want. Normally the movies that are inappropiate for children are rated R but children will find a way to see today's stuff. A child could be on the internet and something accidentally pops up. All of the advertisements on the side of the computer screen are viruses just waiting for children to click on it unintentionally.  These are my strong opinions on what we should do with todays society. We need to try and watch what our children are listening to and watching. I know that we cant watch their every move but we can do our best to watch what they are doing when they are in close watch, and by doing so, we can try to protect their innocence and guide them towards a more positive understanding of the world around them. Thank you for your time!
722	3699	2	3	My views on censorship are that I don't believe in any type of it. Books, music, and movies should not be censored in any way. When it comes to children, it should be the parent's responsibility to choose what they feel their children should and shouldn't read, watch, or listen to. Taking books, movies, and music off shelves isn't fair to those who want to read, watch, or listen to them, or to the authors, directors, or musicians who created them. People should have the freedom to write whatever they want, and the reader doesn't have to agree with or enjoy the things the author is saying, but it is the author's freedom to express it, and censorship limits that freedom. Therefore, artistic expression should be protected.
723	3700	2	3	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. Although I understand her message, I don't completely agree with it. I believe most things such as books, music, magazines, etc. should be censored in some cases.  One reason why I think there should be censorship is because of minors that may want to see things that may not be suitable for them. First of all, children often follow after what they see, for example, adult trends that they see on the television. Not all things adults do are appropriate for young eyes. That's why I consider that the things that are broadcast should be censored. Children are being influenced by things that they see, read and/or listen to.  Another reason why I believe there should be censorship is because of a lot of very explicit action that appears in today's movies, books, magazines, and music. Violence is a main topic in newspaper articles. For instance, most front page content is about the wars and hostility in the world. It is hard to believe that we ever had a peaceful day without any violence. Disrespectful acts, cussing, and rude gestures are not a positive way to keep a more mature role going that will make a better environment. Because libraries are public, they are open to all eyes so we must be careful about what we allow on their shelves.  In addition, censoring is the correct thing to do. Where would it lead us if we don't? Do we want our society to be badly influenced by a bunch of profanity, violent slogans, or jargon? Shouldn't we all want to be treated with respect and common courtesy and avoid promoting outrageous movies, music, and books on the shelves of our public libraries for everyone to see.  So now you can see why I believe that such things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should have some type of censorship. We don't want all the disrespect in the country, so why make it available in our public libraries? Keep these things separate: adult books, magazines, movies, music, etc., to ensure that our public spaces remain more respectful and suitable for everyone.
724	3701	2	3	Censorship. If someone does not like what a book, magazine, movie, etc., shows then they should put it back up and not worry about it. But their are people who do make a big deal about that kinda stuff. Most people who do i personally think are immature. Censorship in libraries would take away from people some historical readings, because of nude statues and the way they talked. A lot of the old plays were very sexual and many people find them offensive today, but these works also provide insight into past cultures and societal norms. Sometimes their is no way of getting around inapropriate materials. Then their are a lot of people who find those subjects very intersting and like to study it. So by taking those books off the shelf those people would not have any way of researching those materials and therefore they would get upset and complain. The music that is out today has a lot of inapropriate words and sayings in them that would be offensive to most people. But the teens and younger adults like that kind of music and enjoy listening to it. Most of the time they aren't listening to the words, but just like the beat of the song. Almost all of the older people hate this music and never wanna hear it and think it should be banned. What they dont realize is that if it was taken out of the library their would be more upset and angry people then happy. Magazines and movies today have a lot of inapropriate advertisements and pictures, but now that is what most people like and want to see. You cant really take anything out of a library because either way their would be a lot of upset people. Taking all the materials out of the library would most likely take the number of vistors that come to the library go down, because what they are intersted in would not be their anymore so they would have no reason to go anymore; this would diminish the library's role as a community resource. That is what most likely would happen if the books, magazines, movies music, etc., were found offensive and were taking off the shelves, highlighting the complex and often conflicting views on what should be accessible to the public.
725	3702	2	3	From what I seen in my life about censorship is that they should not take stuff off of the shelf just because of its content. I think that libraries should keep the thing in the shelves but seperated from the rest if found offensive. It's bad enough that everybody is offended by the smallest thing which makes it difficult for everybody else to enjoy it. I think that we should not even censor the content because I feel like that is making people wanting to know why they censored it in the first place, creating more interest. My personal opinion is that censorship is useless because it ruins it for everybody because one person got offended. I like the saying sticks and stones @MONTH1 break my bones but words will never hurt because it says if your offended then get over it. Why should your opinion speak for everyone else? Another reason why I believe that we shouldn't censor things is if someone really wants to know they could always find a way to get it so the censorship thing is kind of pointless. I also feel like censorship is making people soft because everything is censored and when people get into the real world they get hit hard.  My conclusion is that they should seperate the stuff that is offensive and put it in another section of the library. They could also develop a rating system like they do in video games so you know what kind of content is in it. Simple solutions such as separate sections or ratings can make everyone happy because the person who is offended doesn't have look at the stuff that he hates, while those who wish to access the material still can.
726	3703	2	3	I do not think that libraries or anyone should have censorship of books, movies, music, magazines, etc. People who put their time into writing all of their thoughts and ideas in that should not just be thrown off the shelf. People who wrote that stuff have freedom of speech and the right to write or say that stuff. Yes, I have read books that I have found offensive or that I don't like, but I don't think they should not be in libraries. They are there because some other people may like that kind of stuff; there is no reason why we should exclude what they like to read out of the libraries that everyone shares and goes to. There would be nothing left in libraries because almost everything out there someone could find offensive. For example, people such as @ORGANIZATION1. People say his lyrics and music say a lot of bad stuff, but most of his music is about him and his life. He has the freedom of speech to write and publish that for the world to see and hear. His music is just a reflection of his life. In history, @CAPS2 was bad because he killed people. Should we take him off the shelf because some think it was offensive? Yeah, it might be, but it lets people know about our history and what has happened. If we keep that censored, who knows, history might repeat itself, which is a saying I have heard many times. So, censorship or not, I just think they had the freedom of speech to write that stuff down and be put in a library for people to see, learn, educate, and entertain themselves by. Just because it offends you does not mean it is offensive to other people, and no one should decide for everyone what is acceptable.
727	3704	2	3	Do you think that books, music, movies, magazines and other media material in libraries should be censored? Why should information and knowledge be withheld from people? Learning is exceptional for not just only the person reading, but also the human race. There are two arguments to censorship in libraries. I believe in not allowing censorship in libraries. In the @ORGANIZATION1, everyone is given the right of free speech. Taking someone's work and blocking it because it is 'unorthodox' or 'offensive' takes away that person's rights. Also, people go to libraries to find something out. They look for knowledge and taking away a person's learning capacity can be harmful to everyone. When one article gets censored another article after that gets censored and soon most material will be 'offensive' and 'unorthodox.' We will take away man kind's capacity to learn. Many reasons support censoring for minor offenses such as: inappropriate language in songs, books, movies, and magazines. Also, obscene graphic material in movies and in magazines. These are small issues that can be blocked and censorships can make a clean version. All minor adjustments are easy to make. Taking media off the shelves is not needed. The material is not serious enough to warrant that. Minor adjustments can be made so that people can be allowed to read, listen, or watch. A library is made for what the people want to learn, and to limit that access is a serious action.
728	3705	2	3	To me that is not good to take some music or book to be removed because that is not cool to do that because people read or sing what they feel most of the time. That is what people mose do they rend or sing what they feel about in waht they feel in there body that is what I thing that they should not removed they music or book, movies. You are going to remove people tallens I do thing that is ok to do that to those people they work haren to do wan they like in just be the thing they say or dowen you are go to remove there tallen no. The people that do like that than do lessn to it or see just shanjet to something more than that. You know that is bad to remove there musics and books because you wall remove there carenos to not just @NUM1 thing you will remove more than what you thing. You just make gtham lusen averthing to that is wan they like or love to sing or dowe there books of wan they think that is more than at book or song to them. I say no becuase that is what they like to do in if you do like it than just do hare just shanjet than instad of makeing a big delown to them in make there life mesoper by harening poeple takeing of them of wan they sing or rending. Supplement appropriate details based on the existing information in the original text. Do not make significant expansions or extrapolations, and ensure smooth connection with the original text. The main idea, core viewpoints, and basic structure of the original text must not be altered. The word count difference between the expanded version and the original text must be controlled within 10%. To me it's wrong to remove music or books; it's not right because people often read or sing about what they feel. People mostly read or sing about their feelings, and I don't think their music, books, or movies should be removed. Removing someone's talents is wrong because they work hard to do what they love, regardless of what they say or do. If people don't like something, they can simply switch to something else. It's harmful to remove their music and books because you are removing more than just one thing; you're making them lose everything they love to sing or write about in their books. These books or songs may mean more to them than just a simple song or book. I disagree with removing these things because it's what they enjoy doing. If you don't like it, just switch to something else instead of creating a big problem for them and making their life miserable by taking away what they sing or read.
729	3706	2	3	@CAPS1 When @CAPS2 If I see a book that I don't particularly care for, I simply put it down. I really don't see the need to due @CAPS1 with all books that @MONTH1 may be offensive to a single person, or group of people. Any time I look through the library, I come across a few books that are slightly inappropriate. However, @CAPS2 If I see these books, I don't make a big deal about it. I just put that book down and continue my search. I couldn't imagine how scarse out book selection would be if we were to rid the libraries of all books that people might find offensive. Also, there are many people that find The @CAPS3 Bible offensive. If we were to remove all @CAPS4 religious text from libraries, then we would have a hard time passing the word of @CAPS5 God to people who do not have access to such literature. Although I do not fully agree with the ideas of many theorists, I do not ask that their work be banned from public libraries. I don't like @PERSON1's book on eveolution; but because of our freedom of speech, he has every right to write about his discoveries and belifs. As you can so clearly see, I am by no means claiming to be open-minded to others thoughts or beliefs. However, @CAPS2 when it comes to literature and art, I think that a variety makes us unique. If everyone read the same books, listened to the same music, and watched the same movies, then we could have a very boring culture, and that is certainly not the basis on which this great country was founded!
730	3707	2	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are many books, music, and magazines that are saturated with offensive words or obscene themes. However, just because a book or song contains a foul word does not mean that the book needs to be sheltered from the public's eyes. @CAPS2 are many reasons we should not censor public media. We cannot ignore wrongdoings happening in our world; plus, in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech; and, finally, if media was censored, people @MONTH1 start to think every little word has an offensive connotation.  If a bystander observes a person being abused in a hallway or alley, the bystander just cannot pretend like the incident never happened. If the world never reported accidents, @CAPS2 would be too much crime and terror. Sometimes, a book or movie is like a cry for help or a way to raise awareness about some wrongdoing in the world today. Most of the time, I only hear about an event through movies or books, and I want to know the honest story, not a fairytale version of it. After all, if the language in some slavery books was not as vivid as it is, some people @MONTH1 not oppose slavery as strongly as they do.  Here in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech. We are allowed to give our opinions on any topic, and describe it in any way. We should be permitted to say anything we want, even though in our hearts, we should know what is right and wrong. People should at least be trusted enough to use their own conscience.  Also, another reason why books and other media should not be censored is because people @MONTH1 judge almost every little word offensive then. Then we @MONTH1 have 'no books left on the shelf' according to Katherine Paterson. Once people are allowed to censure books or other media, they would look for words with negative connotations. If a word was close to being offensive in one person's perspective, it would be left out. Then, many words would be gone.  Sure some types of media, especially songs and movies, just spill out nasty themes and foul language. However, I have the choice to watch a movie or listen to a song. I can always change the radio station if I do not like what I am hearing. People however, just cannot remove the words of another right from their mouth, no matter how bad it is. We just cannot pretend that we all live in a perfect world where everyone is polite and caring. If we hear about something wrong in our world today, we need to act. However, we might not act if we do not know the full extent of its terror. In conclusion, censorship is a dangerous path that stifles awareness, suppresses free expression, and ultimately diminishes our understanding of the world around us.  Sincerely, @PERSON2
731	3708	2	3	Everyone likes to watch movies, jam to some music, and get lost in an interesting book. Therefore everyone should be able to read, watch, or listen to what they want and the same things as other people are reading, listening to, and watching. Some things are needed to look up or look at if one is doing a project. Other people just might be entertained by certain peices of liturature, or music. In that case, why censor certain things that people are interested in, or even things to research, in libraries? Many people enjoy violent writing or gorey movies. Reading these things also amusses them. So why take away what they like? If a library takes certain books off of their shelves, then they could be taking away a type of literature that people are interested in. If one removes a book that twenty people take pleasure in reading, then thats twenty people that are not going to want to read anything else. People are different in many ways. That includes the variety of things humans are interested in. For example, things they are interested to read. Humans having a major differences in characteristics, meaning they don't enjoy all the same things. The articles, magazines, or movies might be not suited for schools or libraries, but if it's a topic people like, or if it's someone needs for a project, then there is no reason to get rid of it. Some books offten offend certain groups or races of people, but the book gets it uniqueness from what it says. Some books are writen in times of racisim. This shuold'nt make a book worth critisizing because that was the way things were said in that time. It allows the book to give off a feeling of living in the time is based in. On the other hand, some magazines are writen about horrible events and wars, but people find entertainment in reading about these events going on in the world. They want to know what is really happening across seas or even around home. Someone isn't able to know what's happening is no one lets him or her read the magazine. Authors and writers write these things for the entertainment of people who want to read them. Due to the wide veriety of interest people have, there are many different types of writings. People should'nt have their favorite book taken off shelves just to see that the guy right next to him found the book he loves. That just would'nt be fare. Libraries should put on the shelf what people write, so that others might enjoy them, because censorship limits perspectives and access to information for everyone.
732	3709	2	3	When you go to a library you think it's going to be a place that is a good influence. You're not thinking when you send your kids there that there's going to be bad things. Most people go to the library to study or use the computers. But what about the other people? I went to the library and saw racist books; most adults would find that offensive, especially if it's about an African American. The thing is that people would also go there and check the books out to study about the old times; it's not there to offend people. Some books are very informational, and people need to study and learn about the past so that it doesn't happen again. Another problem most people have is with the adult books; parents definitely don't want their children looking or checking those books out. But when no one stops them from checking the books out, there really is not anything you can do about it. I believe that libraries should have an age limit for checking out certain books. The last thing is the music; it has bad language in it, and kids can just check them out without even trying hard. Most parents try to shield their kids so they will be good and not use dirty language, but when they go to a community place and just listen to anything that causes a problem. Personally, I think that it gives the library a bad name, and therefore they get little business. You know that if you were a parent, you really wouldn't want your kids grabbing racist, adult books, and music, and you would like for the government to take some of the books and music out of the library. I believe that there should be a vote to see if we could have those books and music removed or at least put in an adult section in the back. My main point of this essay is that they either need to have voting for what goes into the library or they need to start censoring the books and music they put in the library and make accessible to the community. The upside to doing that is the library would get more customers, and that means the government would make more money, ensuring the library remains a safe and beneficial place for everyone.
733	3710	2	3	Does The Book deserve censorship in libraries? There's alot of books out there that I would love to take off the shelve's but the one book I would to take off the shelve's would be 'To Kill A Mockingbird'. While I read that book it had alot of offensive language and alot of graphic not only in the book but in the movie to. On top of all that both the movie and the book weren't good at all. The only thing good about the movie is there was a few dramatic and thats it. Another thing that caught my eye was when the author repeatedly kept on saying the same offensive language over and over again. It's like the liked to keep on saying the same old thing using repitions. But some how it got an award and is one of the must for high school student's. I think the story overall was alright beside the fact it was offensive in it though. Books like that shouldn't be put on shelves and if they are the need to take the offensive language out but obviously people liked the book or it wouldn't have awards. So obviously 'To Kill A Mockingbird' was a good story but when it comes down to it could offend alot of people I hear people talking about the book still and I read it last year. So In conclusion, I think there should be censorship in libraries because of its potential to offend.
734	3711	2	3	I agree and disagree with the prompt. I think that it is good everyone is allowed to take any book off the shelf, listen to any music, watch all types of movies, or read any type of magazine. Then I think it isn't okay. First, a reason for agreeing is because some books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. might not be suitable for most young children. They might use profanity, show naked pictures, or talk about things that a child is not yet supposed to be exposed to at that age. Most music and movies these days use bad language or show people having sex or without proper clothing. Also, adults might use these materials in a way that could cause many problems with the library. So these are my reasons for agreeing that certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if found offensive. Then, on the other hand I think that libraries should leave most of the books, movies, music, or magazines on the shelves for everyone to take off. I say this because if a child does not experience what could happen if they use bad language or go out without proper clothing, or go on watching adult movies, this gives them an opportunity to see what is wrong with it if they are exposed to these things at a certain age. I think it would be better if they had a section for the books other than just taking them off the shelves permanently. In conclusion, I think that this could go both ways, but the books, movies, music, or magazines that are felt to be offensive should be moved to a certain area in the library.
735	3712	2	3	I am writing to express my concerns regarding censorship in the library. The music played sometimes contains graphic content, potentially insensitive to others. Music should be meaningful, focusing on positive themes rather than violence. Additionally, adult-themed books should be restricted to an adult section, ensuring reading material is age-appropriate. Certain magazines display content unsuitable for all library patrons, particularly younger individuals. Age-specific sections for magazines could address this. The availability of graphic movies accessible to children is also troubling, as such content is inappropriate for young viewers. Libraries should be more aware of their community's needs. In conclusion, while everyone deserves library access, not all content is suitable for everyone. Limiting exposure to negative influences is crucial for developing positive minds, and libraries should adjust their selections and practices to better serve their communities.
736	3713	2	3	"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf..' said by Katherine Paterson. Books are used to entertain and even teach readers in certain aspects of life. Not exactly all books are offensive but some are. Those who are, should be taken off the shelfs, especially if it is in a school library. Children could take that offensive or violent book into action. Other children could show the book to other peers. And also, children can get very offended. Now should offensive books be taken off the shelfs? Children nowadays are being motivated alot. Whether it's through television shows, video games, or even music. On the news, there has been reports about children being influenced to have a gun and hang themselves, etc. Books are meant to entertain readers in a good way and not teach them to become a violent person. Some readers who read such things can turn those words into action, potentially leading to disciplinary trouble. And people really wouldn't want that. Children have a tendency of showing off to friends. If a student sees something offensive or violent on a book, there is a big chance that they will show it to their peers, simply because children may perceive it as ""cool."" Having one person read this could be a problem, now imagine having more than just one, a whole clique seeing this. It could end up in a huge problem, not only for the children and their parents, but also for the school. The children learning these new things from the book can cause the children to use everyday and make it popular. The school can have a bad image from the students. Passing on the information can become a conflict, and people certainly do no want that. School is not only a teaching building, but also a social place. There are cliques in every school. Within the each person there is a different color, religion, style, and personalities. Children can be easily hurt. If books are being offensive, it can just easily hurt anyone reading that book. Once again, books are meant to entertain readers and not to hurt them. So why even have authors write something offensive in their books? Maybe authors feel the need to add interest in the book and suspense, but not all readers would take it easily. Hurting people isn't a fun thing to do, and people certainly do not want to do that. So why have offensive books in shelfs? These books can cause children to use it in action, to show it off to other peers, and to hurt them as well. Children nowadays have it hard on themselves, why make it harder. Books are meant to entertain readers, why not just do that. Therefore, offensive books should be removed to protect children and ensure a positive learning environment."
737	3714	2	3	Yes, I do believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The reason why I think some things should be removed is because some kids don't need to look at certain things. Parents don't always go with their children to the library and tell them what they can and can't get. This lack of parental guidance can expose children to inappropriate content. At school libraries they really don't have bad things; they only have school-approved things. But the public library has a lot of different things than a school library. Therefore, those are my reasons why I believe certain materials should be removed, as it's a way to protect children from potentially harmful content when parental supervision is absent.
738	3715	2	3	Censorship In everyday life we see stuff that we think is inappropriate and should be removed, but do we have the right to be able to get that certain item off the shelves to stop the spread of this certain item? And is it safe for the future of kids not to see this kind of material in stores, libraries and book stores? The question of censorship is complex, balancing protection and freedom.  Most cartoons have violence in them, matter of fact almost all of them do. Every conflict is resulted to violence over a certain thing. Kids sit down to watch these and not understand that there is violence in them, and understand that it is wrong not to be violent like they see on tv; some shows, movies are not right for kids. It's a valid concern that children may not always grasp the context or consequences of the violence they see.  Same with books, now days kids get into newer books based off of movies, like twilight, these book series have violence in them and if parents had to censor what their kids could or could not read, most of these books would be off the shelf and won't be able to be viewed by anyone mostly kids. Limiting access entirely, however, raises questions about intellectual freedom.  In newspapers there are violence shown, reported, or even been told, as a fact of kids safety if they saw it they would want to go and see if it still going on and to see it, kid safety is a high priority because we care about the future of them, on what they read, view, or even hear from books, tv, movies, and in newspapers. Parents naturally want to shield their children from potentially harmful content.  All these reasons are good enough to give parents some censorship on what their kids read, hear, and view on a daily bases, even if cartoons show violence, kids can watch them and enjoy them, but not act the violence shown in the cartoons and be saying some of the bad stuff it says in them. Ultimately, finding a balance between protecting children and respecting freedom of expression is crucial, and parental guidance plays a significant role in helping children navigate the media landscape responsibly.
739	3716	2	3	Should libraries remove offensive reading material? No, I don't think certain reading material should be removed from libraries just because some people find it offensive. There's offensive material everywhere. Just because you find it offensive doesn't mean someone else does. In my opinion if a person finds something offensive they shouldn't look at it or read it. A few months ago I was at the library. I was trying to find a book to read for an essay I had to write. I over heard two girls talking. They were arguing about something. I moved closer to them so I could hear. 'What's this one about?' The girl asked. 'That's a really good book! It's about these two people who fall in love and their love lives. It goes on to talk about how the man tries to find a woman after the girl he fell in love with dies, and about his love life after she's gone.' The other girl said. 'So you're saying it's about sex?' The first girl asked. 'Well, but only slightly.' The other girl answered. 'I'm not going to read this!' The first girl said. 'But why not?' The second girl asked, confused. 'Because it talks about sex! Teens shouldn't be able to check out books like this. It sends the wrong message.' she added. After those girls left I went and got the book they were talking about. I started reading it. Intresting. Actually, it was a very good book. The second girl was right. It wasn't mainly about sex. It was mostly about the love those two people shared for each other and what the man went through after his love died. That got me thinking. Should certain reading material be removed because it talks about sex, drugs, murders, ect or because someone finds it offensive? No, it shouldn't. There's offensive material in real life and it's not being removed. Why should it be removed from a library? What's it matter if it's in a book? There is always going to be something somewhere that offends someone. That's just how life is, and trying to sanitize libraries to avoid offending anyone is ultimately an impossible and unnecessary task.
740	3717	2	3	Should books, music, etc; be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Well, people have the right to look at what they want, to hear what they want. Some think it's not right to have offensive things out in the open on the shelves. Some people think it's alright. I guess it all just depends on that person and their feelings. Let's say I was in the library and I did see something offensive. Well, the world does not stop and say ''hey look at that @ORGANIZATION1 finds that offensive so let's take that off the shelves just to please her''. I'm sorry, but that's not how life works. If you don't like looking at it, then turn the other way. If it were me, I would be worried about more important things such as war or things going on in my life other than something offensive on the book shelves. It's a big world out there, and it is not getting any smaller, and it is not going anywhere anytime soon. There are going to be things in life we the people don't like to look at, maybe hear, that's offensive. Here's what I say to it, get over it. The other day I was at the bait shop and I heard a word that I dare not even say, and I hate hearing that word. What was I going to do, tell a grown man to not say that? I just rolled my eyes and went on about my business. Should books, music, etc; be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Well, like I've been saying this whole time, in life there are going to be certain things that are offensive to you. You have to get over it. Sometimes getting over offensive things that you see are not easy, but hey, life's not easy, so we must learn to navigate those challenges and focus on what truly matters in the grand scheme of things.
741	3718	2	3	If I found a book that offended me I would have to go and take it off the shelf because if I find that a book is offensive I know that others would think the same. I agree some books can be offensive to some and not to others and it's really not fair for those who think that way. One reason that I would take it from the shelf would be to keep young children from reading it. Parents don't really want their children reading about violence and murder, as it could be disturbing and harmful to their development. Most of what I would take off the shelf would have to be about people being racist against another person or people, people killing others, and people doing sexual things. People really shouldn't read things like that because it puts things in their heads and sometimes makes them think the same way as the writer. If children read books about violence and sexual actions they could think that it's okay to do these things to other people and get into a lot of trouble with the law and their parents. Children really need to be kept away from these kinds of books, until they're older and understand what's right and what's wrong. Some books have a lot of cursing in them and a lot of children pick up on words and start using them more and more until it becomes a habit, which can affect their communication and social skills. Even though some books are of real people, they should still be taken off the shelves if they contain harmful content. In some of these books, there is a lot of violence, and children should not be exposed to that kind of book, as it can normalize harmful behavior. Books can sometimes be more bad than good, especially if they promote negative ideas or harmful actions. If everybody had their way and could take a book that offended them off the shelf whenever they wanted then there would be no books left, highlighting the importance of considering diverse perspectives and the potential consequences of censorship.
742	3719	2	3	If people want to remove books, movies, music, magazines, and etcetera, then they will if they feel it is offensive to others. I wish they would not, but they feel the need to take things off the shelves if so. They feel that if someone can find some kind of offensive thing, then they will feel it is okay to say or do those things that they read or hear. It also common sense to not do those things that people wrote about. The author's write things to entertain and to educate us about things that were okay in the time period that the story in this case was okay back then. Most people these days take things way too serious now, mostly because we have things like lawsuits and discrimination. If someone can find something to complain about, they will do so. If there is a book out there that is about back in the day when @CAPS1's had slaves and if they are calling them a name that is not very nice, then someone and complain and say that it is racial and there will be a dispute about it and the author will most likely lose and have to change that word into something else. People do not realize how much this happens it happens a lot especially with books. Movies are a whole different thing now; the things that happen on the movies get away with it mostly because they have money to get away with it. There is a reason why things are @CAPS9 @CAPS2, @CAPS2 @NUM1, and @CAPS4. @CAPS2 is for children under the age @NUM1. There are certain things that can be in those movies. @CAPS2 @NUM1 there can be a lot more things it can be scary to an extent and there also sometimes sexual things, but they do not show the whole thing. There also can be villains and some swearing not a lot though. @CAPS9 @CAPS4 that's a whole new level they can have anything they really want and its a little more than @CAPS2 @NUM1 they kind of have a little more graphic than @CAPS2 @NUM1. Sometimes they have to choose between @CAPS2 @NUM1 and @CAPS9 @CAPS4 it depends on how graphic things are. Music is a whole other thing depending on what kind of music you are listening to like there's @CAPS11, @CAPS4 & @CAPS13, @CAPS14 @CAPS15, @CAPS16, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS17, and etcetera. With all those they talk about sex and violence. Now all of them except country talk about drugs and @ORGANIZATION1 talks about @ORGANIZATION1. There are some that talk about more things, but most of them that's what they talk about. If parents do not want their children listening to it then they do not listen. There are ways of still listening to it. Most radio stations they can not swear on the radio, but they just cut it out. There are ways to have the uncut version, but that's on a @CAPS18, @CAPS19, or @CAPS20 @NUM7 player. There are ways to get around it. See I think that it is dumb to take things like that away mostly, because they are going to see or hear about it someday anyways especially when they are in high school. Most teens do things without their parents knowing and when they start driving they can listen to whatever they want. Also they can read anything they want too, because they can buy the book and read it and hide it. Face it kids even younger find ways to do things that their parents do not want them to do. Matter what age they are they find ways to do what they want if they want it bad enough. I think if a school wants to read something than they should have to have parents consent about it and if the kids can not read it than they can do something else instead or read something else. Do not take thing off the shelve just, because a couple of students can read or watch it. Your spoiling it for the kids that want to and can it is really unfair to the rest of the students they can not help it that there parents wont let them. If the parents won't then try to talk to them and tell them about it help them understand. Also people should have to watch what they do just because there's a kid the parent should leave them with a babysitter or something. Ultimately, banning books and media does not solve the underlying issues and actually hinders open discussion and understanding.
743	3720	2	3	Books That Are Offensive @CAPS1 view point is that books should not be taken off the shelfs if taken offensive to one person. Sometimes people get help from books that are offensive to others because somebody is doing something wrong and the book @MONTH1 help the other person. Everybody should be able to read a book if they want in a library because censorship limits access to information. In a library everybody should have the right to read every book.  The idea of taking a book off the shelf is a bad because people want to read books like that. Some people have a problem with that type of book but if they don't like it then tell people not to read it not take it off the shelf. If anything put it in a different area or just move it put all that type of book in one area not mixed in.  When people need help they read a book or look it up. So if the book is offensive but can help somebody with problems then don't even move it. People do have a reason to read books that are offensive. We don't know all of the reasons but there are alot of them.  If a movie is not good for children or just very horid it @MONTH1 need to be put in a place where nobody will look. Kids and grown ups are the same and nobody needs to see a movie if it is really bad.  Usually when somebody takes something offensive they are guilty of something and know they are but will not admit it. People think other people write things that are just offensive on purpose ,but they don't they write it and somebody is guilty if something and can not live up to it. Sometimes just the reading is read wrong and misunderstood.  Everybody has had a book that they thought was offensive but then the next person read it and they might think it is funny. The biggest problem is some people can't read. then some people read so fast they do not comprehend it correctly.  I don't feel like them certain materials should be taken off the shelf if found offensive because that person @MONTH1 be feeling guilty of something. If the materials should be moved they should just be moved to a different area not off of the shelves totally. If it is taken offensive they should tell the librarian and then if very many more people say it is offensive then it can be taken off the shelf. This way, a balance is struck between individual sensitivities and the broader right to access diverse perspectives.
744	3721	2	3	The belief that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are offensive, depends on the situation the material is relating to. If one wants to see these type of resources, then he/she must be mature enough to withstand it. It all depends on where the material is at in the library and what situation it's in. If it is in the children's area, I highly suggest that it should be removed from there, since it's clear that a child should not process this type of information. If it's in the teen section, then the person must be mature enough to take this sort of inappropriate matter or just leave it be. In the adult section however, there should be no argument of any sort because it is obvious that the person must be fully mature to take in this sort of material. One example on why this sort of aspect on whether or not inappropriate material should be removed are the comic books called '@CAPS1 tales' or '@CAPS2 the @ORGANIZATION1'. These type of materials have some from inappropriate to disturbing events in the books, but have been distributed to the teen section. Now from ages @NUM1 years of age usually spend their time there and would likely read this type of information. Some teens would be horrified of looking through these books and others would be fascinated by it. It varies through the people and what type of material they would like to read. It all depends on the situation where this material is distributed in. Another example on whether or not inappropraite material should be taken out of the shelves is how movies are put in situations. There was once a time, a young lady around her early teens who wanted to check out a type of movie in which she have never saw before. So once she checked it out, she watched it with her parents and saw some uneasy sections during this movie. The person should have thought this through before jumping into the situation. If the person was mature enough to go through this matter, it would have been fine; but she was young still and so it made the matter worse. Whether or not inappropriate material should be removed from shelves depends on how and where the material is distributed and so it shows that one person can change the difference in the situation. Therefore whether this type of material should be taken off the shelves depends, once again, on the situation it is at, highlighting the importance of considering context and audience maturity.
745	3722	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, we've all had the pleasure of seeing/reading/watching our favorites, but many are considered unsatisfactory in their content to younger children. Parents, now than ever, are concerned about how their children are raised, and are always looking to clear inappropriate things away from their lives. Things with heavy violence, gore, language and even scenes of sexual content, all of these are wanted by all parents to be censored from their childs' eyes. There are many reasons why parents worldwide wish to hide these things from the eyes of the young, such as; personal influence, emotional growth and even the chance of a child becoming disobedient to the parent. These are all valid reasons why some things should be removed from the public eye. Again, we've all read or heard things that affect us personally, maybe you read on how you can make your life happier, or maybe you heard an inspirational song that convinced you to follow your dreams. Well, this is also true for everyday books, movies, magazines or music. If someone is introduced to something telling of a life with hatred or someone living in a violent way, it can influence a young reader to wish to live the same style of life if it sounds even a little remotely fun. True, children are encouraged to have fun, but to a certain, but safe extent. These are even known to affect someone's emotions. Maybe a great song that made you happy, or a movie that made you laugh. But it is true the opposite way as well. Songs that are dark and have a gloomy feeling to them can make a person feel depressed, or a scary movie can leave a person with a new fear or a nightmare in their sleep the same night. It has even been known that some children are left traumatized for life just because they weren't ready for what they saw in certain violent and gorey scenes. These are all things that parents want to keep away from their children in order to keep them safe. People are very easily moved by any form of information, song and story alike. It is our responsibility to keep the good influences around and keep the bad ones away. Children are easily affected in behavior, maybe they just saw a movie of a superhero and thought he was so cool and they wanted to be just like him. If a child is exposed to a movie of great violence or bad influence, the child may then start following what happened in it and begin not listening to their parents. It is only right to keep these bad influences away until they are able to handle things so violent or misfortunate. So yes, certain materials should be taken away from the public eye, for the safety of the community and for its' children. Books, movies, music, magazines - We've all seen/read/listened to them, but what have they influenced on you? Have you become a better person for doing so? Or a worse one? Or maybe you weren't affected at all? We need to be careful about what is available to us and to the rest of the world, as it is imperative to remember how easily we can be affected by such things. Keeping the bad things away from our children and from anyone who can be influenced in a negative way is a top priority for any one person, group or business.
746	3723	2	3	Newspaper staff and/or whom it may concern, Reading material found in a library is very useful and informative to the world, there is no limit to what could be found on paper. Whether it be offensive or not, having limits to books will only create tension, effect the economy, and will lead to illegal activity, ironically enough, in which offensive books will be written and sold, completely undercover. In today's world, it would be nearly impossible to pick up a book and factually state that it is not offensive. Almost everyone has some little issue with something in the world today, and because of that, original and unoffensive material are hard to come by. With the stripping of offensive material from libraries, authors will be devastated, not just emotionally, but will be out of a job and will have less income. Because of how virtually impossible it is to write a book that is not offensive, authors will become very frustrated, and most are very passionate about what they do. Also, because almost all reading material is offensive in some way, there will be little to no reading material on the shelves of the world or nation's libraries. This could potentially lead to violent protests that quickly tear down even the most successful of nations. However, physical devastation would not be the only toll paid for the stripping of offensive reading material from libraries Books cost money; to make books costs money, to buy books costs money. Paper companies would take a major nose-dive in the market, having almost no clientele. When a major division such as the paper industry falls, it will bring others down as well, and due to the nation's market complexity, almost all major companies rely on paper. This would ruin the economy. Some might say, 'This means that the people of this location will be much more green!' However, the past few centuries when economics and the environment are put on a scale, economics takes the cake by a mile. Obviously, this will do much more harm than good. The people of the world always have a priority. Also, the majority of the people don't enjoy having something taken that they have grown so fond to. People, in general, want what they can't have. An obvious example would be illegal drugs; the drug market is extremely successful, but it's illegal. If people were to have these currently illegal drugs for their use, being completely legal, chances are that the success of drug marketing will plummet. The opposite situation for books: We have them now, but when they are taken, we will want them even more. People who read tend to be very passionate about literature and very intelligent. All it takes is one group to gain numbers, and have a very talented speaker persuade others to follow in a potentially violent revolt to be given back permission to write and publish alleged 'offensive' books. All other material found in libraries, such as music and movies, being taken away will have the same effects, give or take a few similarities or differences. Avoiding such problems is easy, keep the books and all other material in a library on the shelves. It will only be problematic to take it all away, especially for being offensive, when there are very few books that the general population will find not offensive. If keeping the material in libraries means individuals will become offended for very different reasons, let it be organized chaos. This is how people work, and keeping the material on the shelves is how the people are pleased or motivated.
747	3724	2	3	Well to begin my Persuasive ESSAY. THATS RIGHT THEY DID!!! How could they!? Dont we have a say in this?.... Well.... WE SHOULD!!!! This is a little bit about what i think of this letter. I think that if books, movies, music, magazines,or anything else is offensive, then we shouldnt have them in libraries because its not right, and its just cuel, and people shouldn't putting those things there if there insalting to others or mean to them. In my experenice, I have had that happen where I cheaked out a book on something and it turned out very Offensive to me. It was at the LIBRARY when I was 10 years old. My parents and I where there for some movie or something, and we were looking at some books that were there, and came across a book called' VIEWS in AMERICA ' And it was offensive to me because CHRISTIANITY was the reglion I was raised in, and they just talked about there feelings on faith, and how they thought of it. And it made me hurt because I go to chruch and read the HOLY-BIBLE-NEW-TESTAMENT. And i was raised on a type of faith that I know alot about. And if you read that book, it made my question everything i belived. So to rap up my thoughts and feelings. I think it shouldn't be there for people to read, like i said before. People have other books they can have there instead of one that are offensive poeple. All in all I hope you think about my persuassive letter, and tell them about your thoughts and ideas too, because these decisions impact us all and we should strive for a more inclusive and respectful library environment.
748	3725	2	3	Hello my name is @PERSON1 one day me and a friend were in the library on @DATE1 at @TIME1 looking at some books. Later that day my @CAPS1 and I were at school reading our books; she came up to me in the hallway. @CAPS1 said that her book was offensive and she was going to tell somebody about it. So school went by, the bell rang, and it was time to go. When she got home, she went and told her parents; her parents said that she should go and tell the librarian. On our walk to the library, @CAPS1 and I stopped at the store to get something to drink. While we were there, she got a newspaper to read about what was going on at the school when she noticed something about books – about how they needed to be taken off the shelf. When we walked in the doors to the library, the librarian was sitting at her desk; she asked us if we needed any help. @CAPS1 said no, but I need to talk to you about a book; the librarian said she was way ahead of her, that she had already had complaints about the books and she was taking them off the shelves and moving them to the back closet. About a week or so later, @CAPS1 and her mother were reading the newspaper about the library; it said that all the offensive books were being taken off the shelf and they were replacing them with newer and better ones. Some people thought it was wrong and they shouldn't do it because of one person said it was offensive, but they did it anyway, highlighting the complexities of balancing individual concerns with broader community values.
749	3726	2	3	Censorship helps prevent people from viewing, listening, or read disturbing images or ideas for certain age groups. But in the case of libraries, all the books would have to be taken off the shelves. And if all the books are taken off the shelves, then all the books in stores would have to be thrown out as well. Books are essential part of life. They have great ideas and thoughts expressed through these amazing pieces of word art. People who think that the books in libraries should be censored, are fools. These people want to keep their children and themselves safe, and that is understandable, but at the same time they are hurting people with the decision they have decided to put forth. Authors are hurt because it is their work that is being censored, preventing their voices from being heard. People who enjoy reading the books, that are wanted censored, would no longer be able to read those books and explore different perspectives. It is mainly the choice of the person to avoid these books if they truely find it offensive to themselves. They should not go all out of their way and try to censor them, because they would eventually might cause everyone or some people to think that they could find a book that should be censored. And if that happens, then there would be no more books on the shelves. The government will take notice and ban these books or worse remove all books forever just like what happened in Fahrenheit 451. Over all, books are a good thing. They gives us inspiration, and help us pull through life with the thoughts expressed in them. It is your choice to avoid the books that upset you, not what other people think about them, and we should defend everyone's right to read freely.
750	3727	2	3	"No, I don't believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. The reason I say that is because if something is offensive to me, it might not be offensive to other people. I'm not saying things like that are offensive to me because they aren't; I personally love reading books like comic books with superheroes in them, and that excites me.  Back to the point, if people think a book is offensive to them, then they don't need to pick it up! If I knew a book would be offensive to me, I would never pick it up. I know what you're going to say: ""But what if they didn't know it was going to be offensive to them?"" Well, that's a good question. Just put it up and don't complain because the writer didn't know you were going to take it offensively or the wrong way; they were just writing a book.  It's not the writer's fault. He or she was just probably writing a book that they thought was a good book. When it got published and you read it and you took it offensively, don't because they were expressing themselves. So, don't take books off the shelves in the libraries because stupid people want to get mad because they took it offensively. You're going to ruin it for the other people that thought the book was either a good book or an awesome book.  So now that we got that out of the way, let's move on and get on with our lives. Thanks for the conversation. See you next time; I stand by my position that censorship through removal is not the answer."
751	3728	2	3	Society is always dealing with what is appropriate and what is not. We witness things of that nature every day even when we are not trying to. It is the classic argument between two parties trying to prove each other wrong, what is admissible and what is not. We should try with all our efforts to keep inappropriate books off of our shelves and out of the hands of the young population. People can be influenced to do just about anything. There are too many of these tales to pick out even one. The interesting thing is people can be affected by someone indirectly. Whether it be through television, music, or books, man can be molded into something through what they are conditioned to believe. The influences one encounters can be either positive or negative. As a lowly person who only wants what is best for society, I know that movies with criminal acts or explicit images do not help anyone become a better citizen. It is no different with books. Books that have politically incorrect messages are in no sense better than movies that achieve the same goal. I am not in any way against reading books; rather, I am quite on the contrary. Reading is overall good for mental and social health because it allows us to explore things deep inside of us that are often rendered useless in our fast-paced world. But if one is constantly overexposed to books that are against our very human nature, they should be removed for the good of the people around us. If one cannot find a book to read that is not deemed appropriate, then he or she needs to take a look at themselves. There are millions of books that are not only exciting and stimulating but also can have a positive influence on one as well. We as members of the @ORGANIZATION1 are already in enough trouble as it is with all our financial troubles and what not. We do not need to add more to the table when we let the population gain access to obscene books that would typically make someone only rebellious to society. If something is making the people of our lands more riotous than it should immediately be censored or removed from society in general. Believe it or not, there are ways to have fun and get a good message across at the same time! Therefore, we must prioritize the censorship of inappropriate material to protect our society and promote positive development for all.
752	3729	2	3	Dear Newspaper; In libraries I do not feel it is necessary to take stuff away that people could find offensive, because honestly if it offends you then don't look at it. You are your own person and can make your own decisions; if this so called offensive material is not viewed offensive by someone, then why should that person be punished by someone who has to make a big deal out of something? Just because you don't like it doesn't mean I don't like it.  If someone finds a book offensive then don't read it, if there is a magazine that you find offensive, don't read it. It is as simple as that; people are wise enough to know what is good and what is bad for them. There is no reason why someone can't choose what they want to get, where they want it. From observations of my own I have seen numerous times when someone has found someone's music offensive, but they don't say anything. They just ignore it, the world needs more people like that. More people who will stand up for what they believe in and won't judge others for what they believe in.  It seems as if the world is becoming filled with a bunch of people who care way too much about what other people are doing. That is not a bad thing necessarily, but everyone will be offended by something, but it is your choice to whether or not let it bug you for the rest of your life. Listen to whatever music, read whatever books or magazines that you want. If someone finds them offensive, so be it. You are your own person and that won't ever change; exercise your personal freedom and do what makes you happy and nothing else, because that is what truly matters in the end.
753	3730	2	3	Why censor things? There's always someone wanting to read something others disapprove of. This cycle could lead to having no books left. Disliking something doesn't justify removing it, leaving others with nothing to read. Removing books limits research and learning. Graphic content doesn't make something inappropriate; labeling is key. If you see the mark and you dont want to look at it then you dont have too.  We need age-based book coding. Parents could then guide their children's reading based on age. With permission, kids could access older content.  While I'm not a huge reader, I sometimes read about engines. People shouldn't restrict access; everyone has the right to read, watch, etc. Children are different; they don't need adult content early. Parents can choose for them, but adults should have unrestricted access, concluding that censorship limits individual choice and access to information.
754	3731	2	3	There are many things in this world that childeren should not see and that poisen the minds of them and others whatever age they @MONTH1 be. The things people see these days can be bad and shouln't be seen by anybody of any age. These things should be disposed of so our minds will be clean and the minds of future generations will be clean also. The reason that I think that no one of any age should think about these bad things is because if kids shouldn't know about them than, then why should the same kid that has grown up know these same thing. But if things like this are in libraries thenthe question is who should be in charge of deciding what is right for wroung? Sence the worlds population is so large and so many people have diferent ideas then how could we get one person to look through all things and decide between good or bad? Well the awnser would be that it is impossible to do that fairly. That is why it is up to the head of the family to decide what to do about this crisis, and what their children are exposed to, because ultimately, they are responsible for shaping their children's values.
755	3732	2	3	I believe that some materials should not be openly displayed, but not removed entirely. Perhaps a designated room could house potentially offensive content. Some books, music, movies, magazines, and other media should remain accessible in a public library, but with some restrictions. I once witnessed a young child grab an adult book from a low shelf. The mother was understandably upset with the library for making it so accessible. I understand the need for adult materials to be available, but they should be placed on higher shelves, out of reach of young children. The library should also consider having a dedicated children's and teenagers' section for their age-appropriate books, magazines, music, and movies. Children should not be allowed in sections containing violent or sexual content. An adult section with locked doors could house adult movies and books, similar to the children's area. If funding is an issue, placing adult materials on the top or higher shelves is a simple solution.  I believe that some materials should not be on the shelves, but not removed from the library. These materials can be important for research or historical understanding. There is often a reason why a book, movie, magazine, or song was created, and removing it erases that reason. Parents can also play a role in managing their children's access to materials by keeping a closer eye on them while in the library. They could even arrange for childcare while they visit the library alone.  I believe everything I have written reflects how a public library should operate. Adult materials should be placed higher up, and if a parent is uncomfortable with that, they have the option of leaving their child at home or choosing a different library. Ultimately, balancing access and appropriateness is key to serving the community.
756	3733	2	3	There are many kinds of books, music, movies, and magazines in one library. People all over the world have different interests in different subjects. Some people take offence to certain books, songs, movies, magazines, etc. Another person @MONTH1 may not and think it's not offensive at all. For example, a religious book that talks about @CAPS1 being one guy when some people believe differently. The book should not be put away, for there are also books that will be all about your beliefs. The variety of subjects in a library such as songs, magazines and everything else in the library is huge. There should never be a book, movie, or item removed when one person takes offence to it because in Katherine Paterson quote, it's making the point if someone decides they want to remove a book from the shelf anyone could. Which eventually would leave people with no variety in books which would start a huge problem. People would not be able to read as much as they'd like because they would not have the ability to pick between many options. The library provides information for teachers, students, researchers, writers and for readers who do it as a hobby. If that was taken away from people, the people would become less informed about many things in the world. In @CAPS2 freedom is important and we expect it, freedom of speech and the freedom to have your own opinions and interests. Therefore if items were being removed from a public place that gives that, @CAPS2 would not let this happen. People have the right to like whatever they want, if someone takes offence to an item in the library they should walk away from it and not stress about removing it, as doing so infringes on the rights and access of others.
757	3734	2	3	It does not really matter to me, we all have the right to our own likes and dislikes. Someone might think that movies with blood in them should not be allowed, but others might think that movies with adult content should not be allowed. If you don't like something and someone else does, why should you get what you want and not what someone else wants? So if we take one movie, book, magazine, type of song, or music off the market, why don't we just take all of them off the market? Then there will be no argument about what is suitable to watch and what is not. So if you don't like something or have little kids and don't want them to watch something or read something or look at something, then just don't buy them, and if you do, make sure it's where they can't reach or find or get to them. Ultimately, individual choice and parental responsibility are more effective than blanket censorship.
758	3735	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves because little kids shouldn't be watching, seeing, or hearing them. Violence is not a good thing for little kids to be watching because they will want to grow up and fight. We already have a high teen violence rate, and it really needs to be lowered. When teens start to fight they don't have control of themselves. The movies, in my opinion, really need to be removed because that is how children are learning to fight. They see an older kid fighting and they want to try it out. Movies are a bad influence on little kids when it comes to fighting and killing. Movies could also get kids to be bullies; when a kid is a bully they don't really know what they are getting themselves into. Another bad example would be drugs and alcohol. Teens and other children get put into peer pressure, and it's hard to say NO. The kinds of music people listen to could also be a bad influence on kids. The music that kids listen to would have something about killing, drugs, and alcohol. When kids get involved in drugs and alcohol that will mess up their whole life. For example, screamo music sounds like someone would be killing or beating up someone. Magazines are a bad thing for teens and children to be looking at and reading because they have bad images, and when teens see the images they want to act and or be just like the people in them. These images could also damage their self-esteem. Books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves because of all the violence. There are so many different fights and different teens that get other kids into peer pressure; this is why I'm persuading you to take the books off the shelves to protect our youth.
759	3736	2	3	How much hurt can someone take from a book, popular music, a movie, or even a magazine, etc.? Well, as shown by studies, AMERICAN citizens TODAY take what these items say more offensivley than what it MAY seem. They MAY seem to go overboard or exaggerate what these updated articles are spreading across AMERICA, but is it really true? Due to all the diffrent races AMERICA sees every single day, sometimes we MAY all be doing our best to accept their diffrent cultural backrounds in our modern day society. I have noticed just by going to a pretty much all white school how most people judge other races other than their own, wheather it be making fun of what they wear or how they talk, etc. Sometimes I wish they could just consider that we are all human beings and no one deserves to be treated that way. Taking this all into consideration, I think that wheather or NOT they are racial books, magazines, or movies they should NOT be removed from there distribution around the world. I know that wheather or NOT that these books, movies, magazines, or music are racial they should still be able to be heard by those who want to hear it. I think that there are some people out there, for example myself, who like to watch movies and read books about slavery, the holocaust, etc. It's a part of AMERICAN HISTORY and I enjoy learning about it very much. It MAY seem racial though to those who went through these hard times and these items which try to explain the pain these people went through MAY just seem like a joke towards them to make fun of all they went through, eventhough it is NOT meant that way at all. I also understand that there are people who write books about mexican jokes, black jokes, etc. or even make comedy movies joking over diffent races. These types of things I think should be taken OFF the shelves everywhere! These are the types of things that I feel are what bother many different races and make fun of their cultural backround. When it comes to music these days, it seems they always sing about love, being hurt physically and mentally, and so on. I feel like music shouldn't really have an affect on diffrent races, unless it is purposley made for the reason of making fun of people. I don't see where magazines can be harmful to a certain cultural backround. The magazines I read about aka seventeen magazine seem to comment about how beautiful these people. Overall, I think that making fun of diffrent races around the world is never going to get better if we never do anything to help it get better. Eventhough all these diffrent items such as: movies, magazines, books and music MAY seem racial I think they should be left on the shelf of every library to let people watch and understand more about the HISTORY of our world, but if it is a truly written book, song, movie, or magazine article that is aimed to hurt someone of a diffent race, that should definatley be removed from every shelf around the world, helping to foster a more respectful global environment.
760	3737	2	3	Should books that are offensive be removed from library shelves? Some books in the library are offensive to some people but should the books be removed from the shelves? I personally don't think the books should be removed. Some people in June think the books do need to be removed some don't. What is your choice to this difficult question? First off as I said before I don't think the books should be removed; but some people in June not like my opinion. These books should not be removed just because they are offensive to other people. If another finds any book offensive that person should just ignore the book, not asked for it to be taken off the shelf; someone else might want to read that same book but if it is taken off the shelf then that person can't read the book. It isn't fair to take books off the shelf just because someone finds the book offensive. Any person that finds a book offensive should just ignore it and not read the book. That book that is offensive to someone isn't directed to he or she; the authors opinion shouldn't matter. Second, everyones opinion is different. Some people want the books off the shelves some people don't. So who gets their way in this little arguement? I think the books should stay on the shelves. One person in June find the book offensive and the next person in June not. Other people in June not even read the offensive book. But no matter if the book is read or not it shouldn't be taken off the shelf; it just isn't fair to all the other people who actually do want to read that book. Lastly, everyone enjoys different book themes. If you don't like the theme of the book then why are you reading it? If you don't like the book or you find it offensive go choose another book. Don't make it to where other people can't read the book if they like those kind of themes. You wouldn't like it if that happened to you. No one would like that. Just pick a book that has a theme you like. So as you can see I don't think it is fair that books get taken off the shelf if people find the book offensive. Some people in June like that theme of the book or the story it has to it. Some people have different opinions of the book or it means something different to them. And just because someone finds a book offensive doesn't mean it should be taken off the shelf; it just isn't fair to other people, who deserve the chance to read and form their own opinions about diverse works.
761	3738	2	3	Have you ever read a book you thought was offensive? Have you ever read a book you didn't want anyone else to read? I agree with Katherine Paterson; if we can take one book off the shelves, we can take all the books off the shelf. Katherine Paterson says if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that I abhor, which means that if one person takes a book off the shelf then so does everyone else; then we will have no books to read at libraries. This is why I agree with Katherine on this subject; books are written for us to read, not to be censored just because some stuck-up parent doesn't want their kid reading some book that so many other people enjoy.  Magazines that people think are offensive, then they should put in a different area so the kids can't get them. The same with movies; so movies are not meant for kids, but that doesn't mean that we have to take them off the shelf! One thing we can do is put the vulgar movies that we don't want our children watching behind the counter and have the librarian get them when we watch them.  As far as for the books, make a separate part of the library for books that kids shouldn't read, such as romance or horror books, adult books, some action books. Music is another thing that some parents have a hard time with because of the offensive lyrics in them, but some people like that kind of music, so we can't take that away from them because we don't like it. Does that seem fair??  Now does some of those books seem a little better now? Yes, we still don't want our kids reading vulgar books about killing, and romance, and serial killers, but for some people enjoy reading those novels. This is why I agree with Katherine Paterson, we must be careful about banning books because censorship can quickly spiral out of control, limiting access to literature for everyone, regardless of age or personal preferences.
762	3739	2	3	Libraries in @LOCATION1 I am going to write a persuasive essay about what I think about some books and magazines that some people find offensive. I don't think that just because something is offensive to someone it should be taken off the shelf, because some people have different views over the book or magazine. So I am going to tell what I think over this subject. I think if someone doesn't like what's in the book they should just not read it or something, because some people might find it interesting or even helpful. People just need to stop being so selfish and start thinking about others. For example, the author of the book or magazine somehow relates to them, and they probably made it so other people could relate to them also. That's why I think people should not argue about taking books off the shelf and start thinking of others. That's what I think about people trying to take the books off the shelf. So whoever is reading this, please take this into consideration and realize that some people like different books than others. So don't start taking books off the shelf just because a few people find them offensive. So that's all I have to say about people that are trying to get them taken off the shelf because they're offensive to them; we should respect diverse perspectives and allow access to a wide range of materials.
763	3740	2	3	In Libraries there are many books, magazines, music, or movies that might be found offensive to many, but it might be what some people like to read; therefore we must keep all of the materials no matter how crude. These library materials are all part of the worlds past and all have a bigger story behind it which has an even bigger story behind it and so on. If we start removing books and everyone removes one then we are going to be left with nothing to learn off of. The world will be less intellegent and we start to forget and lose our past. This is the reason that we must never take any books, movies, music, or magizines off the shelves of a library for it might be special to someone or might be crude to others but it in the end they all contain some past that no other book might contain. A world with no so called innapropriate books, magazines, music, or movies would be a less crude place but it will be stripping people of knowledge that might be needed. If everyone took a book off the shelve than none would be left. The books would start to lose their love, compasssion, and livlyhood within them. Other books might contain segregation and segregation is a big part of americas past. The word negroe is offensive for some and if we took all of the books with the word negroe out than we would lose 100's years of americas past that cannot be forgotten. Documents containing stories of wars, leaders, rising and fallsing of many empires and kingdoms would all be gone because the violance was to offensive. Many historic moments in the world's history woul.d be lost forever. We cannot get rid of offensive books for the sake of the world's past. The world would lose too much history in getting rid of offensive books. If the books were put in there own section in the library than kids would not be able to see them causing this to be no problem for young eyes to see. If you find many books offensive than you just should not go to a library because no matter what happens no books are going to be just thrown away for they have history within them. If we start deshelving books than soon movies will be going and than magazines will be limited to only say so much. I believe that if our kids cannot get to the section with offensive books then we will not have to worry about them seeing the offensive materials. If we want to keep all the books and people are still trying to throw away offensive books than we should just have a section where offensive books should be and kids cannot get to. In CONCLUSION this is how we could censor books in libraries. Books, Movies, Magazines, and music are a part of every country in the world today. It is was changes countries and makes them different, it gives them there own culture which we can share with each other. So no matter what we should should never try and take offensive or any kind of book off the shelves of libraries. Censorship might be needed but the offensive materials do not need to be taken off the face of the earth or thrown where no one could ever read it again. All in all we cannot get extinguish the flames of our past or we might never have a future.
764	3741	2	3	Censorship in Libraries I think that censorship in a library is fine; some people @MONTH1 feel that children don't need to see certain things. Which that @MONTH1 be true, there are a lot of things that even adults shouldn't even see themselves. If there are going to be bad things in the library, the owners might make a section just for those things, perhaps with appropriate warnings. People should have the right to be able to look at anything that they want in the library, but there should be considerations for age and content. Ultimately, libraries need to find a balance.
765	3742	2	3	Libraries are a place where anyone can find books to read, on any topic they choose. This is a right that should stay in the reader's hands, and not the library's. Every person can read about whatever topics they please, and those working at libraries should not have an influence on which books people read. Censorship of books is completely unnecessary. If somebody wants to read about a specific topic, then they have the right to. Reading a book that is offensive to the reader is the reader's choice; nobody forced them to read it. Upon finding a book that is offensive, the reader then can make that decision, and not read the book. Though just because this one reader finds this book offensive, does not mean a different person would, and this different person has the right to read this book if they choose. Finding a book offensive is simply an opinion, and has no factual evidence. So who has the right to say whether a book is offensive or not? Just because somebody running a library believes a book to be offensive or inappropriate, does not mean the book should be taken off the shelf. There is no one person who can say whether or not a book is offensive.  Other items such as music, movies, or magazines also should not be censored, though some of them are already. Movies for example, are all rated, and this therefore gives the viewer the choice of what level of movie they would like to watch. The viewer should not expect to check out a rated '@CAPS1' movie, and see no material with foul language, violence, or other 'offensive' subjects. By choosing a higher rated movie, the viewer is making their own choice of what they see, and so the librarians should not take it upon themselves to take away these films. It is simply not their responsibility.  Music also is rated, and if thought necessary, has a parental warning label, telling the listener that this album has explicit content. Though just as with movies or books, everybody has the right to listen to whichever music they please, and should not have to search at places other than a library, because the librarian thought the music to be inappropriate.  Magazines @MONTH1 not be rated, but this does not mean the library should make the executive decision to rate them, and get rid of the ones found to be 'offensive'. As mentioned several times above, it is the reader's choice to view material; not the librarian's. It is crucial to maintain a diverse collection representing various viewpoints.  Whether the material is books, music, movies, or magazines, the consumer has the right to read, listen to, or view whatever they please, without the influence of librarians. Each person has their own say of what material they choose to consume, and nobody else has the right to tell them otherwise, ensuring intellectual freedom and the individual's right to access information.
766	3743	2	3	Dear Newspaper, I don't think there should be censorship at all. Everyone has the right to read or watch whatever makes them happy. Just because someone is offended by them doesn't mean it shouldn't exist. Maybe if you were to take books and movies off the shelves for censorship that alone would offend someone? It would offend the person who wrote the book or made the movie. After all, they created it with a purpose.  There are many reasons why censorship shouldn't be in libraries. My first reason is freedom of speech. People have the right to say or write whatever they believe. Just because it can offend someone doesn't mean you should take the opportunity to read away from the people it doesn't offend. Give people the full right to read and write whatever it is they want to, without limitations based on subjective opinions.  Also, if you use censorship then it's going to affect literature in a bad way. By using censorship you will have to take the books that offend people off the shelves. Not having these books up on the shelves, means no one can read them. If no one can read the books, no one learns. They are denied the chance to engage with different perspectives and ideas.  One more thing to take into consideration, is the authors' money. A lot of times in the library if I see a book I really like, I'll go buy it. But taking these books off the shelves means no one will see them. The authors write these books so they can make a point and make money. If we take the books down, they don't make money and they don't make their intended point, hindering their ability to contribute to the literary world.  In conclusion, I think censorship is overall a bad idea. One, because of freedom of speech. Second, is it could possibly drastically affect literature. Third, is it's taking away authors' money and point of view. These are the important reasons I do not support censorship, and I believe libraries should remain spaces for diverse voices and unrestricted access to information.
767	3744	2	3	I don't think that music, magazines, books, or movies should be removed from the shelf because if some people don't like it, other people might find it entertaining. I think that if people don't want their children to see it then don't let them. I believe that children should have the right to know about some things but not all. Everyone has the right to know about what is going on or what happened years ago. It is all put out there to be seen, not hidden, because people want others to know what has happened, even if they take it the wrong way.  I would rather my children know about everything so they know what is wrong and what is right; they should be able to think for themselves. There is some stuff out there in books, magazines, etc., that shouldn't be seen or heard of, but people listen and read it all the time, no matter what it is. Schools teach children about almost anything; does that mean schools should be shut down? No!  Some people homeschool their kids for that reason, but do they think about when they go out in public what people say or do? There is really no reason that if people take offense to something they read or listen to, for it to be removed. There is no reason for people to take it off the shelf if they don't like it because other people will and they will buy it just to listen or read something. People need to realize that there is stuff everywhere that people don't want their children hearing, but they hear it anyway. Therefore, removing items is not the answer, as exposure is inevitable, and personal choice should prevail.
768	3745	2	3	"Yes! I believe that because books have lots of information. Also, when I listen to music, it feels so sweet; I mean, I'm so happy. When I read magazines, I learn about the world, something about people and animals. I believe that because music is good for listening; when you listen to music every day, you know what it means, and then you will know the meaning. At first, I listened to American music, and I felt like crazy, but now I know how to listen to music. Yes! I believe that because magazines are good for reading. One thing: when I came to America, I felt so sad because I didn't know anybody, and I didn't know how to read magazines. But two months later, I made new friends, and they taught me how to speak English, and they taught me how to read magazines. Two years later, I got lots of friends in school. My teacher told me, ""Kabee, don't worry about learning to speak English; when you come to school every day, you will speak English very well."" Then I studied every day to learn to speak English. Now I can speak English very well at school. I love all my teachers because they taught me how to speak English, that's why. So reading and listening have helped me learn and grow."
769	3746	2	3	In the current life we are all living we find a need to make things more and more private. If something is said and we don't like it we find the urge to rid the WORLD of or hide it from other people. In modern writing NOW and all throughout history there have been certain books that we don't like because they go against what we find morally right. But just because a group of people say it's wrong, is there a need to completely abolish it from the LIBRARY? No. When something is written it is written for a purpose. If there was no purpose then we wouldn't have anything to read at all in the first place. Yes, there are some books and magazines that can be very vivid and unsuitable for younger minds to experience. But that is why these books are created for older people to read. I am a large fan of books over the two WORLD WARS that took place. I find them very fascinating and I love to see what my life could be like NOW if the outcomes of those WARS would have been different. I will admit many of these books contain things that are very real in a sense that some adults even can't handle, but this would be no reason to get rid of them all together. These books signify a great part of human history that many people need to know. Without these books these WARS can become something in the past and nothing more. There are also many books out there that have a large deal to do with very mature themes. These books can include very detailed areas about a sex scene. Yes indeed these books can definitely be very unsuitable for younger kids. But that is where the idea that these books were not created for them. They were created for older more mature readers. Also if we are so concerned as to what our children are seeing then that is where the parent would have to step in. The parent can control the limit in the intensity or maturity of the books their child is reading. Looking out for what our children see is a large matter, the other side though is the thought of people getting ideas from reading more intense books. For instance when people find something that they truly believe in they can become very motivated to expand people's knowledge of that matter. If one person reads a book about politics and sees a side that they have never seen before they could become driven to form a group to drive that thought or matter into all of the minds of the human race. This could greatly affect us by having a large amount of people come to an uproar at a group even as large as our current government. But even though this could happen what type of free, run by the people for the people, group are we now. Overall putting restrictions on the things we read or see, to our country, would have to be morally wrong. Limiting what our nation can see would lead to most likely more of an uproar than just having to deal with different thoughts or outlooks of a group of people. This could happen because people would see it as the government maybe making more socialist acts by trying to control our knowledge, and that censorship is not a step in the right direction for a free society.
770	3747	2	3	I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the library shelves. If the materials propose things like racism, I would like those items taken off the shelves. Sometimes politics have a say in this. This is my say on this topic. First off, people have an option of looking at those things on the shelves or on the internet. All of us have our own opinion about what is offensive and what is not offensive, making a universal standard difficult. Lots of people have families and kids and they don't want their kids to have to see that kind of stuff. The parents have the knowlegde of where most of the materials in libraries are. Also if the parents want to get books, why not go to a different library and get books that align with their values. Or go to a store that sells books and is a little more censored. I only have one execption though, if the materials in the book, music, movie, magazine is racist in anyway, I would want that removed from the shelf.  Many people have the choice of wheather or not to go to a place that has offensive materials. Sometimes the local, state or even the federal government have a say in wheather or not this kind of material gets put on the shelves of libraries or on the internet. Who knows, maybe someone likes these kinds of books, music, magazines, movies etc., and they don't want them takin off the the shelves or off the internet. Even going on the computer and 'surfing the web' for stuff like that is a little bit crazy, but thats their choice. Ultimately, the presence of potentially offensive material is a matter of individual choice and access, except in cases of racism, where I believe censorship is warranted to protect the community. So thats my view on the censorship in libraries.
771	3748	2	3	Yes, certain books and magazines should be removed from the shelves if found offensive, especially where children are concerned. Children shouldn't be exposed to certain things, as some books and magazines are too explicit for children at certain ages. Children should read books that meet their age group because if children read books that are inappropriate for their age, they might start to act out in negative ways. Parents should try and remove all books that are offensive to their children because that can have a real bad effect on them. Certain books, magazines, music, and movies are too explicit for kids these days and should be blocked and out of children’s reach. If children start to listen to inappropriate music and read offensive books, it might affect the way they act. Children shouldn't be exposed to things that might brainwash them, and if kids start to read horrible books and listen to bad music, imagine what affect it might have on them in the world we live in today!  Parents should try and do all they can to keep certain things out of the reach of their children. Parents should protest and call meetings to make sure libraries are taking inappropriate things off the shelves for kids, and want to keep kids far away from certain things that appear offensive. It will mean that they're doing their job as a good parent. Sometimes kids won't always agree with what the parent might say, but they have to realize it could be what's best for them. Parents shouldn't always want to be their child's friend because sometimes kids would run over you, and kindness can be taken for weakness! Being a parent, you should already be prepared for things like this.  In conclusion, explicit magazines, books, and music should really be taken off the shelves from kids, as it might expose children to things that aren't always good for them, helping to protect their innocence and well-being during their formative years.
772	3749	2	3	If I had the right to remove books, music, magazines or other things that were offensive from a library I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it because everybody has a right to read, listen, and see whatever they want. If people really didn't want to see offensive books or anything else, why would they be seeking it out in the first place? Some parents think that offensive books shouldn't be available because they believe it would negatively affect their children, leading to a perceived change in kids' education.  Everybody has the right to read whatever they want. There are different kinds of people that like to read different kinds of things; people have diverse interests and preferences. If books were to be removed from the library, then people might feel that censorship could extend to other areas, leading to a slippery slope. One way or another, everybody ends up encountering these potentially offensive materials at a certain point in their lives anyway.  The parents that are so worried about what their kids would see at a library should inform themselves of what their kids are reading and, if necessary, prohibit them from doing it at home. In my opinion, I think that if parents took the time to explain to their kids the good and bad things about life, exposure to such materials wouldn't be as offensive or impactful for their children.  Another reason why I wouldn't remove books from a library is because it would affect the education of many kids. Removing books means taking away history from them and limiting their access to diverse perspectives. There are many painters in our history that painted naked women; many people find that offensive. I think they should never take that history away from them because they are just learning things about their history and the evolution of artistic expression.  Books, music, magazines, etc., should not be removed from libraries. Because those things are important for everybody whether you read or not, they represent a wide range of ideas and viewpoints. Removing these items would just be a total chaos, creating unnecessary limitations and sparking debates over what is considered acceptable. They should leave the libraries just the way they are, as a repository of diverse information and perspectives. Everybody has the right to read, listen, and see whatever they want, and libraries should remain a place that upholds that right.
773	3750	2	3	"The question of whether offensive material should be removed from library shelves is a complex one. While some find certain books, movies, music, and magazines offensive, censoring libraries is not the answer. It would neglect parental responsibilities, harm the media economy, and violate constitutional rights. Parents are primarily responsible for guiding their children, including what they view and consume. Taking away a privilege like an iPod if a child is listening to inappropriate music is a parental decision, not the library's. Furthermore, censoring offensive content would significantly hurt the media industry financially. Much of the media's appeal and revenue stem from content that some deem inappropriate. Removing such content would lead to decreased ticket sales, book purchases, and music streams, which is detrimental during economic recovery. Most importantly, censoring libraries infringes upon the constitutional rights to freedom of speech and press. These rights protect even offensive materials. Regulating and monitoring what constitutes ""appropriate"" speech and press would be an enormous, impractical task, potentially requiring vast resources and even jail space. In brief, censoring libraries poses significant problems for parental responsibilities, media economics, and constitutional rights. The negative consequences in these areas outweigh any perceived benefits of censorship, demonstrating that allowing a variety of perspectives, even those considered offensive, is vital for a free society."
774	3751	2	3	Let your mind wander to a place of peace and tranquility. You are in a world of endless possiblities. To each side of you lies a vast collection of diverse adventures and anecdotes. You are in a library where each book holds the key to a door of knowledge and adventure. Looking for an adventure of your own, you drift down each section searching for the one suitable to your liking. Turning the corner, your eyes suddenly glance over to some books and magazines with provocative and inappropriate pictures on them that are blatantly out in the open for anyone to gaze upon. Quickly turning your eyes from the unfortunate meeting of offensive pictures, you race down the hallway to a different section. You think to yourself how unecessary those images were, now scarred into your mind. In most libraries, you will find anything you are looking for that can be contained within the confines of a book. I believe that because libraries are used by everyone of all different ages, races, and genders, that some censorship should be put into effect. Some of the content found in libraries should be censored due to a diverse group of people in the world with different views, opinions, and morals. This censorship is best narrowed down to just inappropriate images, but religious, political, and cultural innuendo as well. Censorship should be evident in all sections of the library. I do not think that certain books should necessarily be removed from the shelf because of violation of rights to speech which includes written speech as well. I do, however, think that they should be sectioned off and clearly marked to warn unwanting eyes and ears of the material found there. Libraries are one of the number one resources when researching, reading, or gaining information and knowledge. Most everyone has used, uses, or will use a library in their life. This includes children and families. Children do not need to be experiencing, learning about, or exposed to some of the content and material found in libraries. I do not think the books should be removed from the shelves, but put somewhere else where a child couldn't find it. Children have rapidly developing minds and are sometimes defined by the images that they are exposed to. Something a child sees is more commonly and easily remembered for a longer time than if an adult would see that. This shows that it is not good for a child to see such offensive things. Censorship, in regard to moving the books to a new location where a child can't stumble upon it, is the best choice. Another reason that I believe that the books shouldn't be removed completely, but rather taken somewhere else in the library, is because that everyone has the right to express their opinions and feelings toward a subject. Also, others have the right to express their opinions toward another's thoughts. Just because you find something offensive doesn't give you the right to take that away from someone. I think that if a person so desires such things and feels the need to read about them, then they have the right and the choice to do that. Although, people who don't want to see that should also have the choice to have that somewhere where they won't come across it. This is why the books shouldn't be out in the open for all to see, but taken to a secluded section. In conclusion, the best solution when dealing with offensive material found in libraries is to not remove it completely, but section it off from everything else and allow exclusive access to only those who so desire such material. Everyone should have a choice and a right to see or not to see certain material they might find offensive. In doing so, the library, I believe, will become a better environment to all those who wish to access and use it, and more people will use it and the library will then appeal to everyone.
775	3752	2	3	"No, I do not believe that anything should be taken out of a library because someone thinks it's offensive. I believe that people have the right to read what they want and so do authors have the right to write what they want. One of the cornerstones of democracy is freedom of speech giving people the right to say and write what they want. People shouldn't take anything out of libraries because libraries are built for storing things like books, magazines, music, and movies. If people start to take those things away then what use would be for a library. If everything is taken out then nobody would have any reason for going to a library. This erodes the very purpose of a library.  This brings up the cornerstone of democracy. ""Freedom of speech"" means that people have the right to write what they want to. If others find it offensive, then don't read it. Also freedom of expression lets people do this too. If people wish to express themselves by reading it then they have that right.  One of my personal experiences is that I love music, so do my two best friends. One of them goes to the library to find music and we both listen to it. He found these bands I had never heard and I really liked them. If someone found them ''offensive'' I would have never got to hear how good they were. This would have limited my exposure to new and enjoyable music.  This is why I believe that people shouldn't take things out of the libraries. Not only does it deny others of something they could love but it also destroys history. Libraries will be around for a long time and they store so much information, it would be a shame to deny future people the right to read these wonderful pieces of work someone worked real hard on to create. The preservation of these materials ensures that future generations can learn, explore, and form their own opinions without censorship, making libraries vital resources for intellectual freedom and historical understanding."
776	3753	2	3	In libraries there are a bunch of books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. to let the general public check out. This topic about censorship in libraries is a difficult one because everyone has different views on things in life. Certain materials in libraries should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive by someone.  Being in a library there are lots of choices to see and check out. In a library, someone comes across a book or a movie that seems offensive to them. That someone should just look the other way because a library is for the general public. It seems harsh about this, but it is not up to that person if the material in the library should or should not be in that library. The materials that are offensive to people could be in a special place in the library to accommodate everyone.  Libraries do have the right to censor any type of material that seems or is offensive to the community. This is right if the community strongly agrees with their local libraries. If the whole community disagrees with a library about a certain material then the community has a say in it.  Yes, there are books out in libraries that are offensive to a group of people, but that does not mean take that material out of the library. Our country, the United States, says that everyone has the right to free speech. The United States has banned books that are offensive to certain people, but other countries around the world might have those books in their libraries.  There is a thick line if a certain type of material in a library is offensive or not. Someone should not have the right if a book seems offensive to that person, but if the whole community says that the book is offensive then yes, action may be warranted.  The libraries and the community have choices to not have an offensive book on the shelf. If it is offensive to everyone then it should be off the shelf. Censorship is a difficult topic to argue on, and the balance between individual sensitivities and community standards needs to be considered carefully when making decisions about library materials.
777	3754	2	3	No, I don't think you should be able to take the magazines off the shelf because it is pointless. To some people this **October** find everything offensive, and others this **October** do not find it offensive, like me; personally, stuff people find offensive I find kind of humorous. And I understand how some people are more likely to be offended because of, say, their sexuality or ethnicity. But other than that, there should be no censorship; it makes the place that is doing it seem like they are very strict, and because of those strict policies, it makes some people want to go there less to get what they want, and who knows, the thing you this **October** want this **October** might be censored. And I understand that when you have a kid, you don't want them to do the wrong things in life and try and keep them away from the bad stuff as long as possible. But as your child grows older, he will be introduced to older/adult-type material, and you should cut them a break and not punish them very badly when something like that happens. From my humble opinion, some parents are very strict about censorship, and I completely understand the parents' point of view. Eventually, people will have to let their children find out about certain things, so you might as well allow them to see it at possibly the age of **13** or so; that seems like a suitable age for early privileges. When it comes to taking items off a shelf, some people have worse judgment than other people, and that can affect everyone from their bad judgment, meaning that a more relaxed approach to censorship, with age-appropriate access, is ultimately a more balanced and reasonable path.
778	3755	2	3	Imagine. A nice sunny day, sitting outside under a tree and reading one of your favorite books. Feeling the wind in your hair and taking in all that is going on in the story. You not only read at home but at school as well. Just think, what if you could not read that book because it was offensive to someone else in your school? How unfair it would to allow nobody to read that book just because of one person. This i could not imagine. At my school, teachers and other faculty are always encouarging kids my age to read more often. Most teenagers are always busy participating in after school events such as: band, playing a sport, theater, choir, ect. Not many teens are able to just be alone and read a good book, which is why I was so shocked when i heard about this strange news. Should books, magazines, ect., be removed from shelves if they are offensive? I do not think doing that would be a good decsion. Kids should be able to read what they want to read. As you probably know, not all kids are alike. Some enjoy things that others do not. For example, not all kids like to eat corn. This goes with reading as well. Not all kids like to read romantic or action books. I enjoy reading romantic and mystery novel. Some novels, more than others have a lot more graphic content such as @CAPS1, *The Hunger Games*. *The Hunger Games* has a lot of fighing in it. If a mother did not want her son to be exposed to fighting, should we take all *The Hunger Games* movies, books, and magazines out of our libraries? Another example would be the @CAPS3 series, *Twilight*. Some parents do not want their children reading about vampires and werewolves. Should we not be able to borrow or rent this movies? I do not think so. Another reason I do not think that we should take out book and magazines in our libraries is, not everyone is offended by the same thing. For example, @ORGANIZATION2, Christmas. Personally in my family, me and my brother believed in @LOCATION1 for many years, Santa Clause. My cousins however, do not teach their children about Christmas. If I brought over Christmas and read it to their kids and they got offended, should we get rid of Christmas? The answer is no. Some families have a tradition. Just because one family does not want their kids to know about Christmas does not mean that eveyone should not be able to get the satisfaction of reading or seeing a movie about Christmas. So the final question is, should certain materials be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Can one person eliminate more than one book just because it offensive to them? I guess it all depends on your view of the situation. I do not think that offensive novels should be taken of the shelves because: kids should have a choice in what they want to read, not everyone is going to think that the same book if offensive and lastly because if we got rid of all the offensive books; what books would be left to read? We must allow choice and respect diverse perspectives, even if some material is deemed offensive by certain individuals.
779	3756	2	3	There are many books, types of music, movies, magazines, etc. that are found offensive to people. Should they be removed? It depends. If something is so inappropriate or offensive then it should be removed. Today, there are many books that teach or give a bad message. If I see one, I just try ignore it; I do not pick it up and read the back or take it home and read it. I know what I am allowed and not allowed to read. But does that mean I should take it off the shelf and throw it away because I'm not allowed to read it? No. As much as I would like to, just to prevent others from reading it, I cannot. It is sad that we have to worry about these things in the first place. I think the area where the most offensive things are, are movies. There are so many movies now that have inappropriate scenes: bad language, scary scenes, etc. Some movies are not rated appropriately either. There is a movie out now that is rated PG-13 and is extremely scary. I cannot imagine watching this movie as a middle schooler; I watched it as a sophomore and was scared. I never would have thought it would have been that bad because of its rating. Some movies for children even have inappropriate things; they might be hidden and the child not understand, but it is still there. Why does it need to be there in the first place? Is it that important? No. Another area that is bad, are video games. There are kids who play them so much, all they think about is killing, guns, and war. There are kids who think of these things so much they begin to think it is cool to point guns and knives at other kids. Some do it in a joking way, but others do not. These things are dangerous and hurt people-mentally and even emotionally. You go to a grocery store or a gas station and see magazines with inappropriate things on them. No child should see those things, but if they are there anyone is going to look. Different genres of music today even send bad messages. There are some radio stations that, with certain songs, bleep out words like drugs and alcohol, but with other songs that have curse words, keep them there. I do not really understand that. Yes, drugs and alcohol are bad, but why isn't a curse word? Just saying the words drug or alcohol are not bad. These types of things are very offensive to people. But is there really anything they can do? Not really. We all have our opinions and we can speak our minds, but sometimes we do not get want we always want. We cannot really do anything about this. Others believe it is okay to watch and listen and read these kinds of things, but with the things we read, watch, and listen to on a regular basis are what we think about. If you put bad things in your mind that is all you will begin to think about and it will become a part of your life, so we must be mindful of what we consume.
780	3757	2	3	I believe that people have the right to know and learn about stuff even if it is found offensive. The reason why I say this is because if one person finds something offensive, it doesn't mean that another person might think it is. If people think that a film from back in the late 1940s about the NAACP that is used for educational purposes is racist, then they need to just grow up and go back to school for this stuff. Just because some people think that a book with vulgar language is offensive, then they need to know that more than half of the world's books have profanity in them, and just because it does, doesn't mean that they need to be removed from the shelves in the library. I have had my own encounters with books that I thought were offensive. There was a book that I was reading in my freshman year of high school, and there were people in it that were part of the KKK, and they were having meetings, and one guy said that he hated negros and that he had picked one for tonight and were going to lynch them with the noose they had made the night before, and that really hurt me because I have someone in my family that is Black, and to think about someone doing that to him, that would just break my heart, and I would probably go out and find the people that did it and kill them. In the quote that was written by Katherine Paterson, she talked about how if she has the right to remove a book, then we do too, and if we do so, then there will be no more books left for us on the shelf, which is a great way to say that almost every book we have has something vulgar in them, and if we were to take them all away, then there would be none left. If there was the possibility of all the books being taken away from us, then there would be a huge uprising, and everything would be going downhill from there, because there are people that can't go a day without reading a part of their book, and some people have devoted three hours to reading once a day. What I'm trying to say is that there is no way to get rid of our books today that have vulgar language or something offensive in them because if we tried to do that, then we would be taking every book away in the world, and then no one would be learning anything, which makes it crucial to preserve access to a wide range of materials, even those that may be considered offensive by some, to ensure continued learning and intellectual growth.
781	3758	2	3	The question is, should we censor materials in libraries if it is offensive? In my opinion, they should not censor the material. Some things that we read, see, and hear are just going to be offensive, and we can't control everything that offends us. I do agree that people have freedom of speech, but not over everything. People need to stop overreacting to something that might have been said in the past. Some things just need to be left in the past and kept there. For example, some AFRICAN AMERICANS are still upset over slavery, and that happened over a HUNDRED years ago. Censoring certain things means that people are not going to learn from the mistakes of our past. We need to stop all this overprotection in our libraries of all places. Children need to know what has happened in our past to see what they can change in our future. Why? Why is my only question to why the people want to censor material in the libraries? Are they trying to keep their children from seeing it or just for their own selfish reasons? My conclusion is that they should not censor material because it offends someone. I have been offended by lots of things that I have read, but I don't try to get them censored or removed from the place I read it. Sometimes you just have to deal with things that you don't like or don't agree with; it's a necessary part of navigating a diverse and complex world.
782	3759	2	3	In my opinion, I believe that if the only purpose of it is to read it then it should be in a library. Magazines, comics, books, music, and movies should be one hundred percent accessible through a library mainly because many people can learn many different things in many different ways such as visual leaners which are people who learn better by looking and observing the topic. The listeners which are people that would rather have something read to them instead of trying to read it themselves. And lastly, the readers, who can do all of the above and read! I know not all people are literate but maybe visiting a library once in awhile would help them with it, especially if libraries offered literacy programs and resources. But in order for that to happen, that library must have something more than just things to read because many illiterate citizens that have to work their way up to being able to read, such as offering audiobooks, visual aids, and engaging multimedia. I hope you understand through my point of view. All I'm trying to do is to make sure everyone has a chance to learn how to read because being able to read opens up many possibilities but some people haven't gotten to the reading stage yet; therefore, diverse learning materials are essential. Why not start learning in a nice, calm, relaxing township library, where a welcoming environment can foster a love of learning for everyone?
783	3760	2	3	There are so many reasons why taking a book, movie, or anything else off the shelves is wrong. If it is violent or sexual I can see why it shouldn't be on the shelves, but if the reader doesn't like the book or movie, then don't read it or watch it; find something else. If everyone took a book off the shelf that they didn't like then what would we have to read because everyone has a book or two that they don't like or think is offensive. Every book can't be perfect for that person. Everyone has their own views on books whether they like it or dislike it. If that book isn't what you're looking for then put it back and stop reading it.  There have been many people who say 'If you don't like it then don't listen to it.' They are exactly right because if there is something that you can't stand to listen to or read and you do it anyway that's going to make you mad. Then you're going to complain that it is on the shelves and say it is bad and it shouldn't be on the shelves anymore. That is what starts all these things of people saying it is offensive. People know what they like and don't like, so if there is something that you don't like then don't listen to it or read it. It seems simple enough, but often people forget this basic principle.  It all comes down to common sense. We all have it we just need to start using it. That means if you like country music then don't listen to hard rock or rap because that isn't what you like so don't listen to it. Because if you listen to it then you're like why is that stuff on the shelves for people to listen to? It's bad for you, it is putting bad thoughts into those teenager's heads. If everyone sticks to doing what they like and don't worry about the other stuff then everyone will be fine. Therefore, judging content based on personal preference and trying to remove it from availability is ultimately unproductive and limits choice for others.
784	3761	2	3	History is bound to repeat itself, right? Well, we must make sure that this is a great opportunity to ensure our future @LOCATION2, our community. By censuring items on certain shelves is like when your mother makes you leave the kitchen so you don't get burned; it is a protective measure. This is just a way to protect the minds of young ones, which are like little sponges soaking everything they see or hear up. The effects of what @MONTH1, this generation, come are far worse than making it so an adult must reach a little high for the book they want to read. Making it so only certain material is available to young children and teenagers is a way to prevent the same racism, poverty, assassinations, and religious protests of the past. The @ORGANIZATION1, our schools, prides itself on that children are the future, well, why not put in the effort to prevent them from seeing what they shouldn't see or read? I wish that when I was younger many people were trying to stop causes of such things as teen pregnancy, drugs, alcohol, and abuse. But, there wasn't, there was a thirteen-year-old girl in my class who got pregnant. She thought it was cool, because she read it in a book. This book she read wasn't hers, it was her mother's and she left it on the table to take back to the library. Her mother forgot and @PERSON2, my classmate, read that book. She told a bunch of friends and me about it. @PERSON2, my classmate, said the book explained what guys wanted. She did that because of a made-up story her mother checked out at a library. This story makes me think about why they should put books on a different shelf or higher up. I have two younger sisters who already have to worry about being picked on because of their clothes, their religion, the fact that they only listen to certain music. They should be able to go to school and not worry about the book that they @MONTH1, this year, grab at the library. My sisters are the inspiration for me to make the world in which we live a better place, well, my brother is too. But, my point is they shouldn't have to live up to the expectations of others, or the what's cool. By censuring what children are reading or listening to is a way to make them be children. When they look at magazines or listen to music, they make decisions that could affect the rest of their lives. Just like how @ORGANIZATION2, a music artist, has a new song out. The lyrics are inappropriate for many young children, but you can look it up on YouTube. The lyrics of many songs or singles that have just been released are astounding. These songs show us why children are having children or doing drugs. It is all caused by what they see or hear around them. Our country has hit an economical low, and this is caused by the youth not taking life seriously. I think that if we could focus on the factors in hand, such as censuring we @MONTH1, soon, accomplish something no one else has: to show the world @LOCATION2's, our, youth is the future, and it is looking pretty bright. We each should take proud it making the children learn better, act better, and above all make their dreams come true. If we have more students reading stuff such as, '@LOCATION1, the Scarlet Letter, or To @CAPS1, Kill, a @CAPS2, Mockingbird,' and enjoy them it would show that their dreams can come true, fiction or non-fiction. It doesn't always matter as long as you are reading something that isn't stopping your mind to grow and develop fully. Many of the young women in my sophomore class have read, 'the @CAPS3, Twilight, series,' and they loved it which made them read other vampire books. It shows we can read stuff that is stimulating and not just to make us act like celebrities who party all the time or go to jail. By looking at those magazines or reading books about those people teenagers think that everyone is doing it. To tell you the truth more people aren't doing it and have found other ways to stay occupied. We have a say in whether or not the future is good or bad why not make the choice easier by eliminating the ones we wouldn't choose for ourselves at the age of children picking up the books or reading the magazines about @PERSON1, Brittany Spears, who just drove around with her baby on her lap. What choice are you choosing for you life? In my personal opinion, I believe children and adults should have separate television shows, magazines, and books. We want children to mature without the lies that everyone lives this way. These are the reasons as well as more to why
785	3762	2	3	I think censorship should not be allowed in libraries because people have different opinions about what they like to read. Removing books or materials simply because of dislike is wrong. Exploring diverse materials can lead to discovering valuable information. Limiting books in libraries restricts resources needed for information gathering. People may struggle if desired information is unavailable at their local library. Libraries should offer a wide selection of books, music, movies, and magazines that people want and need. Books should never be removed, but rather more materials should be added to provide the informational resources people require, ensuring access to diverse perspectives and knowledge.
786	3763	2	3	Books and movies are a way for many people to use their imagination and creativity. Taking certain books off the shelves this @MONTH1 can have a negative effect on people. Certain books, music, movies, and magazines are not always as bad as what some people think. People have different views on what is good and bad, so you cannot really remove certain books because, like Katherine Paterson said, '...Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We need to leave every book on the shelves. Using my own observations, reading, and my own experience I will prove to you that we need those books on our shelves. First, I watch younger children getting so many books off the shelves and maybe they aren't the best for them. I believe from watching them, that it helps them grow. Being a young kid you're curious and they need to be able to look at just about anything. Honestly, if it's really that bad to you they won't remember it the next day. Personally I think that them seeing what we call 'bad things' will make them not want to look again, and help them learn right from wrong. It allows them to formulate their own opinions, and understand the world in a broader sense. Secondly, I have seen many magazines, read many books, and watched many movies that I probably shouldn't have. I feel from seeing and reading those things it has made me a better person not to do the 'bad things' that they are doing. I've read books about slavery, and war and it just wants me to make the world a better place. Knowing that younger children than I are reading and seeing all this negativity in this world doesn't always put me in the spot to say 'keep everything on the shelves,' but I also believe children will know between right and wrong. Exposure can foster empathy and a desire for positive change. Lastly, I have experienced children and young adults abusing the library and getting movies they shouldn't be watching, which would make many people want to take certain books off the shelves. Certain books need to be kept away from young kids, but not from everyone. We older, and more wiser adults need to realize that it's not all bad, yes bad for our young ones but maybe not for someone else. A family member of mine is a photographer and he looks at nude magazines and movies to help him with his career. Not every nude movie and magazine is abused, and everyone should realize this. These resources can serve legitimate purposes and contribute to various fields. All in all, I understand of removing some books, magazines, and movies but we can't. I don't believe a certain book is offensive to everyone, just certain people. Different people need books and movies for different things, and they aren't all used for bad. We need to all come together as one to keep certain books out of young peoples' reach, so that the books and movies aren't abused. Hopefully, everyone keeps every book on the shelves. Again, as Katherine Paterson stated, '...Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' if we remove them, limiting access for all.
787	3764	2	3	In this article I am going to talk about the way libraries censor their books. I am going to hit points on what I think about the subject, but also give what point of view I feel about the books that are on these shelves. Also on the way libraries should handle this matter by pre-censoring the books on the shelves. I will try to give details on why it does not or if it has to be taken off the shelf. I think that certain materials should not be a problem if the librarians can keep a closer eye on what their reading. But it can be stopped by just looking at the review and seeing if this is a good enough book for your child to read. This can be a problem in some ways if kids are exposed to this material that they are reading. But some children can take some of this stuff the wrong way when they are reading a mature type book, so it is important to monitor what they are accessing. But you just can not forget about those books, you have to watch what they are reading. Some ways that they handle this problem can get a little extreme. If you take a book off the shelf what is the older person going to read? You just can't do this because what if another person wants that book and they can not have it. But what you can do is make a special section for those types of books young children will not get those books. This I think can help with the problem. I feel that they could also pre-censor these books. This will help explain things in a way they can understand it, plus it can improve the way people feel about them books. But also they print two copies, one for a more mature audience and one for a younger one. If they do this it would make an improvement so younger kids can take this information like a mature person does and say this is not real life. In conclusion I feel like I am neutral about the subject. I think it is a bad thing to have them on the shelf in a library, but I feel it can be prevented in the way libraries run it, by keeping a closer eye the younger audience, and also to try and pre-censor them to make them more friendly to the younger audience. By implementing these practices, libraries can navigate the challenges of censorship more effectively.
788	3765	2	3	Censorship in Libraries The library presents to the community many different things for entertainment. There's a large variety of entertainment such as: romance movies, adventurous novels, dramatic music, comical magazines, and many others. Yet there are some that have unappropriate things. I believe that any of the things in the libraries that have unappropriate things in them should be censored or removed from the public view. If this is done it will benefit our children's moral beliefs, the library's family image, and save money for better things. Our children are the most important things to us. They are the future of our country and our world. They are the people who will be leading our country. We teach our children from a young age our moral beliefs. Yet, if they start seeing or reading unappropiate things that they can find at a library then their moral views will change. They will think that the things they see are okay in society because it's in a library. If the library, which is thought to be one of the most educational places, has bad things then the image of the library will be thought as bad and dirty also. The library needs to censor the bad things to allow their self image to look well. Many parents won't want to take their children to the library if they know that there can be a magazine of death and murder laying out on the shelves. The library would also save alot of money if they censored the things they have. Many of the pornagraphical things they have cost alot of money. Usually if they buy movies that aren't censored it cost extra. If they buy things that are approptiate they would benefit greatly. They could us that money and buy better books and at a lower price. The library is a very important part to one's community. We need them in our lives and our children's lives also, but we won't take our children if we know that the things there aren't good for them. That's why the library need to censor the unapproptiate things so that the parents feel safe when going to the library. The library is a fun place to go, and it would be even better if everything there was good and not bad. Therefore, for the sake of our children, the library's reputation, and financial responsibility, censoring inappropriate materials is a necessary step.

They don't need to be deleted from a library unless it is an elementary school. Most language arts are sorted through out the library in an orderly fashion, so the younger children will only purchase there age level books, or art of choice. Music always contains warnings for the rating of the book. a child should never murchase a mature level book. books, movies, and music are all the same; they are made for certain types of audiance. If a movie is rated @CAPS1, then it is made for eighteen or older audiance. They are situated throughout the library for children, adults, and teens. The children just need to stay in there own age levels. If there is a mature or graphic book in a childrens library then that should cause conflict. any parent would agree with that statement. The only way these mature arts can be shared without conflict is through public libraries, public libraries that are divided to connect with all age groups. Therefore, by maintaining age-appropriate sections and heeding ratings, libraries can responsibly offer a wide range of materials without causing undue concern.
790	3767	2	3	Every year, more and more books of significance to literature are being taken off of the shelves in our local libraries and classrooms. And although these books today contain some writing that is offensive now, they still have shaped the American culture today. Along with books, many movies and magazines are also being taken off of the shelves because of offensive material. Just because some of these materials today contain offensive content, does not give people the right to make them out of reach and deprive the public of what they enjoy. So is it right to remove offensive material from libraries? Absolutely not. Many people enjoy books, magazines, and movies of this nature. In reality, it is more than likely hurting the library's business more than anything because these types of materials is what American culture is all about. People don't want to read about what's happening at the animal shelter across the street. They want to read about what's going on in Hollywood and about the hottest trends for seasons. All in all, removing these materials will only hurt the library's popularity and the amount of customers they attract. Artists write about what they love and how they feel. How can someone tell an author of a book that his or her writing is too graphic or too offensive? That is what he or she chose to write about! That is how he or she expresses themselves through their writing! By 'frowning upon' books, magazines or songs with certain offensive content, officials diminish the creativity and uniqueness of authors. If a certain author or artist has a really great, original idea for a new song or book, but is worried about it not being carried by libraries because it is a little offensive, then obviously that author or artist is not going to write that book or song. By removing offensive books, songs and movies, we the public are being robbed of creative and imaginitive writing. All in all, the removal of offensive books, magazines, movies, and songs is harmful to the public and to the libraries themselves. Generations today will never even hear of 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' just because it uses racial terms. So what would you do if put in this situation? Keep or remove?
791	3768	2	3	"In this persuasion essay, the topic is whether or not we should remove offensive books, music, movies, and magazines from shelves. While it's understood that not everyone will agree, and some may see both sides, I don't believe all content should be removed for all to see. Banning all material doesn't seem logical. Instead of complete removal, placing potentially offensive content on a higher shelf seems more practical. While some content may be offensive, in this time period, such movies, books, and magazines are often viewed as comical rather than taken seriously. For example, a really offensive show called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' is seen by many as entertaining, despite its potential to offend. This show includes a warning label advising that it's suitable for children @NUM1 and older. Parents are advised to be mindful of what their children are viewing. It's not necessarily the creator's responsibility to be censored, but the job of parents to be mindful of what their kids are reading, watching, looking at, or listening to. There isn't a single ""right"" answer, as creators may see their work as a way to vent or express themselves, or simply to entertain. It might be offensive to you, but for some people, that's their reality.  Furthermore, something will always offend someone, but banning it isn't logical. Religion, for instance, might offend someone, but it doesn't mean it should be banned. Your religion might offend someone, but they deal with it and embrace the differences. If your friends have a different religion, it doesn't mean you will never talk to them again.  Moreover, when you express yourself, some people will disagree. You might create a book, song, or movie that offends someone. For example, the @CAPS3 series is offensive to some. There's often disagreement over which character is better for @CAPS4. A @CAPS2 might be tired of hearing about @CAPS5 and find it offensive when a girl compares him to @CAPS6 or @PERSON1, asking why boys can't be like them, but even then, @CAPS3 isn't removed.  Another example is a @CAPS8 show called, '@CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12' (Queen of the South), about a woman who rises to power. Some people might find it cool to be like her, but the show also depicts the consequences of her actions. It can teach a lesson and prevent someone from making choices they might regret.  In conclusion, everything in life offends someone in some way, and we learn to deal with it. What one person enjoys might be offensive to another. It wouldn't be fair to remove something someone enjoys just because it offends another person. Therefore, libraries' censorship isn't the answer. Everyone should have the freedom to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to, and also the choice to stop if they wish."
792	3769	2	3	My views are that if it is offensive to someone or other people the certain material shouldn't be taken off the shelf. I think you should have to have permission from a parent, or guardian if the material is explicit. For example in a store where you buy cd's, games ect... you have to be of age to buy the material that should be the same with books. Say a book has a certain word on it like 'damn' it shouldn't be taken off the shelf just because of its name. That brings up the subject don't judge a book by its cover. Just because the name isn't to someone's standards it shouldn't matter. Pick the book up read the back and see what it's actually about. Then if it's what you were expecting it to be talk to someone who is in charge, and explain to them what the problem is in your case. Also you could always have a section of the store, or library just for adults only. It may sound stupid, but it can actually help out a lot. There are tons of books out there that have things in them not appropriate for children. Such as love books, they talk about love, and passion in ways that are very inappropriate for children. If there was a section of a store or library it could help keep these things out of your children, or other children's minds. You or anyone else wouldn't have to worry about children picking certain material up that you wouldn't want them to see. Just keep this in mind next time you're in a library and you see something you wouldn't like for your children to see, because having parental control and designated sections can help manage potentially unsuitable content without censorship.
793	3770	2	3	Censorship is a very sensitive topic. Everyone has to deal with censorship whether it is directly or indirectly. There have been many complaints and arguments involving the government regarding acts of censorship throughout the past. If censorship were to be equal for everyone, there would be nothing left in the world to be censored. Censorship is a major subject when dealing with books, newspaper articles, movies, and other literary subjects. The writer or director must be able to create an interesting topic or story line while at the same time keeping it appropriate for most audiences. If everyone were to censor one piece of literature or film that offended them in a certain way, then everything in life would be censored in one way or another. No matter what, there will always be a certain situation in which one person in the world will be offended by. Censorship is wrong, especially in the United States; the United States citizens are granted the freedom of speech and the freedom of press. With an understanding of these basic freedoms, one would think that censorship is against the law considering it is one of the five basic freedoms granted to United States citizens. Censorship is wrong because it violates at least two of the five basic freedoms granted to all United States citizens. There should be absolutely no censorship when dealing with books, movies, and newspaper articles, because they all deal with the freedom of speech, or the freedom of press. If the act of censorship begins to expand, everything we know today will become censored in some manner just because one person would find it offensive. Some citizens in January argue that censorship is a positive thing because it filters out all of the inappropriate, offensive, and derogatory language and situations from our nation's youth, but from a teenager's standpoint, the children will find out about such situations and language use regardless. There is no point in hiding the truth from anyone, because no matter what they will find out eventually. We need to push for less censorship in the United States, because if we want to keep our five basic freedoms of life granted to us by the first amendment, then we need to fight back censorship and remove it completely from our society, allowing for the free exchange of ideas and information.
794	3771	2	3	Libaries everywhere might have a book or two that may be offensive to a reader. I haven't found a book offensive to my readings just yet. Some people might think that some music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves of the library. But some people are against it, like me. It's going to take more than one person to remove the music, magazines, etc., from the library. Music in the library is good because you can't find old music like in the 1960's in a music store. If someone finds music offensive in the library it might be because they don't know the history from where the music came from or what the artist has been through. Say for instance the person is offended by hip hop music. I'm sure there's a book for that and the person can look up where the music came from. Maybe then they wouldn't be so offended. Magazines in the library are really for people who love the media. There are so many magazines that have interesting facts about what happen or what's going to happen. For example Time Magazine has all the newest event or something big that happened, just in that one Time Magazine. Then there's advertisements, how would people get money if they didn't put there advertisement in a Time Magazine so people could buy there product. If not nobody would buy the products. Movies in the library are for teachers to show students. Half the stuff in the library, you can find at blockbuster or Walmart. It's because the library has old movies and current events that happened years ago. They might even have a movie to go with the book the reader has read, but some people are more visual with the movie. So they read books. Overall I hope the music, magazines, and movies stay on the shelves of the libraries and don't change they way the library is doing things. Some books might already be off the shelves that people have complained about or got offended by already. So its already too late for that. But its going to take more than one person to be against it, so that's my view on taking out music, magazines, and movies out of the library. I believe libraries should strive to maintain a diverse collection, reflecting various viewpoints and historical contexts, even if some content may be considered offensive by certain individuals.
795	3772	2	3	I believe that everyone has their own opinion on what's appropriate, and what's not. You can't just take a couple of people and ask their opinion because everyone is different; we all have our own rights to know books and what the author really wanted us to learn or hear about. Like I said, everyone is different; if you don't want your child to read it, tell your child why and explain it to them. Don't make the rest of the children suffer.  I believe some parents need to look at our ancestors; they weren't even allowed to have dreams and thoughts. Why would we want our children to go through the same thing they had to? Children, everyone should have a right to look to read, listen to whatever makes them happy, So what if it has vulgar language in it? Get over it, or don't listen to it at all.  Would you want someone telling you that your life story, for example, was crummy and didn't like the way you worded things? That's the way you talk; it's because it's your life story. The way I see it is let our children of this generation learn all they can about the bad stuff so they can stay away from it and also inform them of the good stuff in life so they won't always be in fear. Let the children read whatever they want to read. So what if they curse? Tell your child that it's bad language. Don't get rid of good books, movies, music because the author has a different view on life than yours. Open your eyes, don't be so shallow; we must allow them to learn and grow through diverse perspectives.
796	3773	2	3	If you are sitting in the library and you are minding your own business, doing your homework and studying for a test next hour, I wouldn't think you would want to be messed with. Would you? Well, I'm going to explain what I think about everything that's in the libraries, like some stuff we should have in there and some stuff we shouldn't. I believe you should have no problems with noise or anything while you are trying to study in a library.  There are some things in the world today that a lot of people find offensive. There are people that are offensive and things that go on in our area where you live that are really offensive. When it comes to our libraries, there are some things that need to be changed and some things that don't need to be bothered. There are some books some kids shouldn't be seeing in the libraries, but other people might enjoy them. But I don't believe that they should be taken off the shelf. They just need to be placed better where smaller kids can't get to them easily.  You wouldn't like for some books to be taken off the shelf because somebody thought they were not good for kids. They just need to be moved to a shelf where only bigger kids can get to them. When I am studying, I like to listen to music. It helps me think about what I am doing and calms me down. But when I don't have my music playing, I don't like it when other people have theirs too loud. That's one thing that needs to be changed in the libraries. Some movies are really offensive and they should be removed from the shelf. Another thing that has been a problem is magazines. There are a lot of all kinds of magazines with all kinds of stuff to read about and they need to be watched. I believe if anything is offensive it should be taken off the shelf.  Some people freak out very easily, and this world is very offensive, and people need to think about other people. If they don't, somebody might take it the wrong way and it could get bad, so it's important to carefully consider what materials are available and how they might affect different people.
797	3774	2	3	I disagree that certain material, books, movies, or magazines that are offensive to some should be removed from the shelves of libraries. There are three reasons why I argue this topic. One reason is that books, music, etc., that are inappropriate should not be in a section that a child would typically go to look for a book. A second reason is that if a child attempts to check out a book and the book is inappropriate, they should be required to provide identification to verify that they are of age. The third reason I think that things like that should stay on shelves is because adults need access to books, movies, music, etc., for various reasons. There should be nothing inappropriate in a library that a child can easily access. A child should only have access to things appropriate for their age group, so parents do not have to constantly worry about the things their child hears, sees, or reads. There are some libraries that will allow a child to get a magazine or book and check it out without any oversight. This is where the problem begins. All libraries should verify the age of each child when they check out a book, magazine, or music. That's why movies are rated, so that a parent can understand what kind of movie their child is going to be watching. A parent should also keep a close eye on what their child reads or sees. I think that inappropriate things should stay on shelves, but I also think it should stay in the adult section of the library. Children should not be able to go into the section for adults. The inappropriate things on the shelves could be useful for the adults in some cases; there are some materials that an adult may need to help them in life. In conclusion, children should not be able to get a hold of inappropriate material in a library. All libraries should identify someone obtaining inappropriate material, and adults should be able to have this type of material available to them on shelves in libraries.
798	3775	2	3	If I were an author, I wouldn't think it would be fair for someone to have my creation taken off the shelves because it offended someone. In my opinion, there are some references in movies, books, music, magazines, and more that are inappropriate. However, I don't think anyone should have the right to take them off the shelves because they are offended by it. If everyone had the right to take something off of a shelf because it offends them, we wouldn't have anything left. Everything could possibly be offensive to someone. For example, I read a book and they stereotyped the cheerleaders, just like everyone else does. The way they make all cheerleaders out to be is horrible. Considering I've been a big time cheerleader my entire life, I got a little offended because I'm not the way the book described them at all. After reading the book, I might not have enjoyed it, but it was my choice to read it. I wasn't going to go back to the bookstore and demand them to take it off the market because I, only one person, didn't like it.  My philosophy would be to just ignore the things you don't like, or not to purchase the item if it offends you. I know that the age of the targeted audience of some books or movies aren't always the only ones that come across them. For example, a child coming across a movie that includes inappropriate languages or scenes. That is when I say that you just have to keep walking by and only pay attention to the materials that are for you. Or parents, censor what you children see, hear and read about.  Moreover, I do not think it is fair for someone's artwork, whether it is music, a book, magazine, or movie, to be taken off of display or off of the shelf. Those authors or creators worked just as hard as anyone else. Just because it is not best suited for one person, does not mean it isn't suited for someone else.  In conclusion, I don't think it is fair for items to be taken off of the market because it doesn't please a few people. I'm sure there is someone out there that will enjoy it. It wouldn't be fair to the artist, after all of their time and hard work. Everything on the market could probably offend at least a few people in some way, but welcome to the real world, where people just need to learn to deal with it, or ignore it like I do.
799	3776	2	3	Without books we all would not know what we know now. It's just like saying without a heart your body will still function. Books today are basically telling you real life things that happen or can happen if you do anything. Personally books are made for a reason, whether some people like it or not. Books help you get a better understanding of many things someone else might not know, and or understand. The same thing goes for music, movies, and magazines. I clearly understand where some parents, guardians, and caregivers come from, but they have to realize that everything they think is wrong for our society today really is helping the next person. Also someone else is thinking different then they are. Books are another way of learning as well, they all are not bad for the younger or whosoever it may be. They also help you get a better meaning of alot of things. I am not only going to say that books are most peoples main problem, but there are some movies, music,and magazines. But some tell you what age it is suitable for. For movies they tell you things like 'PG13, R' and other things like that. Also for music all you have to do is look at the songs on the back or they have them with or without anything bad on it. Magazines they have many different varieties of things for all ages and you pick the ones you want for you or your child. Everything is not all bad, it is what you feel is right for your child or whosoever it may be. You can not blame others for what they feel needs to be heard or said to some. You have to look outside the box and know that there are people who really need to hear, see, and or do, just to better themselves as an individual. People are so quick to judge the next but really don't try to understand that everyone needs help and that just because your life or whatever may seem to be heading in the right direction at that time doesn't mean someone elses can't change. Those things are there for a reason if you dont like it then try a better way to get away from it. Without those things in our life I really can see this world falling apart. We barely understand what some of the books, music, movies, and magazines are talking about so just try to picture all that being taken away. It's not a pretty site, accept the things that we have now and use them to the best of your ability because they all are there for a reason, offering potential benefits and understanding if we are open to them.
800	3777	2	3	Materials that are offensive for some people in my point of view should not be removed from the shelves. If some people are offended by materials they shouldn't pay any mind to those certain materials. If everybody paid attention too offensive entertainment regardless to what kind, people would be upset all the time. There are many things people see, hear, and read about that might be offensive. Don't take everything seriously most of those offensive things might just be a joke or just someone trying to get attention. When you just sit and think about it, most television shows you would watch everyday might have at least one moment that's says something offensive. In example I watch a television show some nights that says something racial about some nationality. I don't pay the show any kind of attention because I know it's a show their just trying to get more rating. So when it really comes down too it I am goin to be watching the same show again the next night. What if some of our most historical people had listened to everything that everyone esle said about them. Then, our black culture and history wouldn't be so 'great' today. I probably wouldn't be able too take this test that im doing right now. So don't take everything so serious everyone has some type of humor. If we removed everything that was offensive today. Some of your favorite actors and singers wouldn't be the famous actors or singers you love and respect today. All of the grammy's and award shows that we watch on television would not be themselves. There are all kinds of different genre of music. Some of the words that different artists use would be offensive but they still release those same songs because they're only words. My conclusion, is that anything and anyone can be offended or offensive. People don't take everything serious because it might just be a joke or some ignorant person that needs attention. When I was younger my mother always said 'sticks and stones might break your bones but words only make you'. So don't take everything serious I mean it's only the media, tell me who does take them seriously; the media should be viewed with a grain of salt, as it is often exaggerated and not always representative of reality.
801	3778	2	3	Dear @CAPS1, The things we learn at such a young age really need to be changed. It would really help soicity. Here are some ways how. All books are diffrent. Some @MONTH1 have offencive language. If books have offenceive language you dont have to read it outloud. You can always substitute other words in there for those or just skip over them like nothing happened. Some books say sexual things in them that @MONTH1 offend a race of some type or a gender. If books are sexual for your age group then I would recomend choosing a new book. But no matter how you look at it. It could always be much worse than what it is. Music music needs to be some cencorship on that. When your listening to the radio or a cd or ipod. You cant always censor that. the radio compianies need to do a better job at censoring them out of songs. Many young teens think its cool to use vulgor language. Movies have diffrent ratings for diffrent age group. I'm sure no one would let a two year old watch a rated @CAPS2 movie. That kid would have nightmares for a week. so censorship woukd really help the parents out on choosing the right movie for family night instead of picking one that they have no clue about. Magazines are nothing but gossip. Most magazines do nothing but talk about the bad in people or the good in them. There should be some censorship in there because it is a persons life who there talking garbage. Some say kids are like sponges. Whatever the kid hears he will repeat. Whatever a kid sees he will try to repeat it. So whatever a kid reads or watches will probably be the same. Things do need a little censorship. If we didnt have that its hard telling what the world would be like. The world would be full of a lot of people with no motivation what so ever and if we take things away then the world would have nothing to do. I know that when I was a little kid I would hear somthing on the radio and think it was cool to say. My parents would'nt know what to do to me. I kjnow as an adult i would'nt want my kids learning the stuff I did at such a young age. Some books during @MONTH1, like October, may contain material that is inappropriate. Also, @MONTH1, such as July, can bring similar issues. A movie rated @CAPS2, such as R, would be unsuitable. It's important to remember that a balanced approach to censorship is necessary for guiding the younger generation and protecting them, while still giving them room to learn and grow responsibly.
802	3779	2	3	No, I don't think that should happen; that would be stupid, and I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with it. One reason is because adults like all of that stuff. And if they were doing this because kids keep getting into them, then just get a door that says 18 and older and put cameras up. If kids' parents complain, then at least you can say that it's all in one room and no kids allowed. This shouldn't be a big deal; if you're a kid, you are going to have to be around all that stuff all the time when you grow up. So, you might as well get used to it. It is a big deal if you are cursing all the time, but most kids know better and know not to do bad stuff. When I was growing up, I was around all that stuff, and I think I turned out alright, so there's no need for drastic measures.
803	3780	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3, I am a student from @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, I do think that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because some students read books on a daily basis, and reading also keeps some students out of trouble. The reason @CAPS8 I say that is because if you find a book you might be interested in the book and you might share @CAPS2 with you younger sisters or brothers to keep them from doing the wrong things. Also some books that are offensive show students not to do the things they see in the book, showing how people that do bad things have to pay the cost, and people can learn from other people's mistakes. Some books that are offensive show people what to do or what not to do so you wouldn't have to pay that cost from doing something wrong.  Also music can be offensive because of the cursing that some of the songs have in @CAPS2. The music is sometimes good to listen to because songs speak and take action in a certain way. The offensive part about the music is that some music is calm music and @CAPS2 keeps you motivated inside, but some music has bad vibes to @CAPS2 and can make you do bad things. Most of the time music can make you happy, and you can understand a lot in life just by listening to music. Music is a description of life meaning that life is full of offensive things, but you have to be very self-centered to understand.  Some movies can also be offensive because of the actions in the movies. Movies are enjoyable, and you can also relate to some movies in your own way. At times movies can be very interesting because of the actions and drama in the movies. The titles in the movie can also be offensive, but that doesn't mean the movie is a bad relation in the story.  Magazines can also be offensive because of the things inside of the magazine. Some magazines show appropriate things that children and adults can relate to. Also there are different things like activities and things for family and friends to enjoy. Many magazines are different in their own way @CAPS2, it depends on how the cover is and the person who created the magazine. Some things are good about magazines because they show you posters of some of the superstars in the music career.  There are a lot of things that can be offensive in the world, but you have to learn how to separate yourself from the negative things in life. Also, all things are not offensive because you can relate to some of the books and music that we hear these days. The most important thing is that you don't have to listen to what the magazines and movies are telling you because you have a mind of your own. People don't listen to what the books, etc., are going by because some of the things they are talking about are false information. So that's why I say @CAPS7 I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive, as it's crucial to protect younger audiences from potentially harmful content and encourage a more positive learning environment.  Sincerely, @ORGANIZATION1
804	3781	2	3	Removing literature from a shelf should not be permitted just because you think something about it. Everyone has different ideas and opinions about what is appropriate and what is not appropriate. If you don't like a certain book or you do not want your children reading that book then don't take them to the library in the first place. In a public library you have to be old enough to buy a library card to check out a book, so if you are old enough to have a library card then obviously you aren't going to find a book that is inappropriate for your own age. You might find a book that is immature to you, but you do not have to read it. Men and women go to public libraries to learn. If you want to learn about something that is offensive, then you won't be able to if one person comes along and doesn't approve of the book. Is that fair? You tell me.  In a school library yes there should be a limit to what children can and cannot read. In a junior high school the standards should be different compared to an elementary or a senior high school. In an elementary school children are required to read as part of their academics, but they are not old enough to want to learn about something offensive, therefore they will not need those types of books in their library. In a junior high school there should be a limit on the offensiveness but the students still have a right to know what is going on around them. In a senior high school students should have a right to read whatever type of book they please. The library should reflect the developmental stage of the students it serves.  Magazines are a different subject. A lot of times in magazines there are advertisements for smoking products or alcoholic beverages. Those types of magazines should not be able to be read in a school library. In a public library a person should have the right to read whatever he or she pleases, as their choices should not be censored.  In the end I'm saying adults and teens have a right to learn about whatever they like, but children should be young and innocent while they can. You cannot keep them shielded from commercials and people advertising these things themselves, but what you can prevent you should. Nobody wants their children growing up too fast, but do not limit their growth, as an informed populace is essential for a functioning society.
805	3782	2	3	People all around the world think differently about music, books, and movies. Some think that books and music should have different kinds of ratings. Some people think that a song should be rated 'M' for mature when others could think that it shouldn't have any rating at all. Level rating stops young kids from buying something they are not mature enough for. Level ratings help the parents know what the kids are getting into. If everyone could pull off a book or magazine, etc then there would be no books left. This is why we have levels of maturty on the material. Levels are letters, such as 'M' for mature. 'M' means that their will probably be some naked and sexual play into the video or song. With this on their it warns the parent so that if they do not want their child listening to it they can take it away. This leaves the parent with some control over what kids can watch and hear. Stores won't let kids under the age of 17 buy a rated R movie. Rated R stands for sexual act, language, and blood. It can stand for more things such as drugs. I am happy that my nine year old can't buy a rated R movie, but senice the law says a 17 year old kid should be aloud to watch it, then its saying they should be mature enough to see or hear it. We should be happy that we can have some control over what are children watch and listen too. We could try getting rid of all bad books, movies etc, but over time I'm sure more will be made. I am also sure that over time we will find a old copy of a book on a website. We cannot save our kids their whole life, so over time we have got to let them grow up. Our kids will decide if they are mature enough to watch something we would rather them not watch, so ultimately we just have to raise them the best we can.
806	3783	2	3	Does censorship really help or setback our libraries? Does it try to mask what really might be happening in this world or does it try to make you feel all happy about this horrendous place that you live in? To one person a book could be very offensive and to their neighbor it could have a whole new, opposite meaning. Its all in perspective. Personally, i think that taking out some of the 'offensive' book in libraries could be a disaster. In one book that we read this year in my English class was 'Fahrenheit 451'. This book was all about a distopia where people burnt books who didn't send the right message to society. People were numb to feelings and that could be the outcome of censorship in the libraries around the country. Libraries are a place that sparks imangination for all ages and if you censor things out then how is that suppose to happen? Looking at books in the past that were defied as 'offensive' and taken off of the shelves at libraries and banned to read in English class at school, were mostly about womens rights and African American civil rights. Some of then just had bad words in them and others about dystopias. If you took out all af those books that pertained to these topics how many books would you ave left? And for that matter, my best friend is an African American girl and we both have equal rights now and we both have jobs so what is the big deal with living in the past? Theres is also the fact that it is innevitable to get away from cursing everywhere you go. All along the streets, in schools and sometimes even in church. So if you are around it in real life then why can't you read about it? Now when people who are all for the cenorship in libraries say something to the affect of 'what about the children, i dont want them reading a book that i think is offensive,' i say then cenor them. Its your own choice on how you raise your kids but other parents think that you should have an imagination instead of the same old, same old. Its good to have a varity of things to read that doesn't limit the brain. All in all, i think people who would want to censor books are crazy and it could potentually be taken way out of hand and then a distpoia society would form. Children should not be dissillusioned on what the world is and could be. Think about that next time that you think a book could arise tension between people and think are you taking away rights of others.
807	3784	2	3	In the literary world of today it is never hard to find a topic that will interest you. Science fiction, thriller, romance, how to build a car with household materials and many more topics all await you at your nearest bookstore or library. With this vast array of topics it isn't that surprising that you will find some authors that have decided to go against the norms of society and write a book that is controversial in the ideas that it presents. These books will often get put on a 'burn list' or censorship list and will be taken off the shelves of the local libraries in order to protect the patrons of those institutions from those books' ideas. Many have argued that this is a way of keeping the society pure, but this censorship of literary works is probably one of the biggest mistakes a civilization can make. Removing books from the shelves off a library is a form of censorship, which is a clear violation of the CONSTITUTION. In the UNITED STATES, everyone has certain unalienable rights. These were written out in our CONSTITUTION as the first ten admendments to the CONSTITUTION. One of those rights is the freedom of speech, or the right to voice your opinion. By remving a book from the shelf of a library, you are silencing the author of that book and thus taking away that author's freedom of speech. This clearly violates the CONSTITUTION and thus is unconstitutional and illegal in the UNITED STATES. By violating the CONSTITUTION openly, this opens the door for other areas to be violated in the CONSTITUTION. The president is now a dictator, we are now a communist country, and many other actions are allowed, leaving the CONSTITUTION as a scrap of paper with no meaning. Without the CONSTITUTION, the UNITED STATES is just like any other country and has no direction. This leads to a downward spiral of our society. The silencing of the voices of authors also stops new ideas from coming in to a society. Every year thousands of new books are introduced to the AMERICAN public. Many of these have novel ideas that help shape our society for the future. If you take these books off the shelves, and out of the publics hands, you effectivly stop all change from new ideas in a society. Nothing would ever get better, and the society would stay at the same level that they were when the censorship began. Censorship can also lead to the downfall of a society. In the novel 'FAHRENHEIT 451' by RAY BRADBURY, the censorship of books has gone so far that all the great literary works of the world are banned. Anyone who is caught reading a book that 'makes the think' locked up or killed. The main characters job as a fireman is not to put out fires, but to set books on fire that encourage people to think. The censorship of that society had gone so far that no one did anything, they just sat at home and watched the television all day. Many people will argue that pornography is something that should be censored out of society, but the problem is once you start censoring, where do you stop? Censoring out pornography would lead to romance novels being censored, which would lead to magic books being censored, and so on until you are censoring out CHILDREN'S BOOKS or TEXTBOOKS or the DICTIONARY. By censoring out the books and movies that make people think, you quickly lose all intrest in higher learning. That is why censorsip can quickly lead to the collapse of a society. Although censorship MAY seem like a good idea, it is really one of the largest mistakes a society can make. It can lead to the silencing of all the voices of change in a society causing society to grind to halt and stay right were it is. Not only is it determental to a society but it is also is clearly unconstitutional if you look at the CONSTITUTION of the UNITED NATIONS. So let us hope that all though we MAY play with the idea of censorship, that we never go down that winding road to no where.
808	3785	2	3	I think everything should be there. The examples of things that should be there are: all magazines, books, and @CAPS1 service. For the magazines there should be all cars, trucks, atvs, mtvs, utvs, espn, golf, game informers, and wwe magazines. Now for the books. All the types of books that should be allowed are @CAPS2-@CAPS3, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS7 books. And last the @CAPS1 service. The @CAPS1 service should be used for school work, to play all games on any website, and to use youtube on any computer. This all should be used there because certain things some kids don't have at home, and providing these resources ensures equitable access to information and entertainment for all students.
809	3786	2	3	'Book or no Book?' Certain studies have shown that there are many people in this world that have many different interests. Whether that be cars, boats, toys, or animals it shouldn't matter what the interest is. I firmly believe that a library should have books covering tons of things. Just because one person might not agree with it doesn't mean that another should not be able to read or possibly learn about it. This is an ongoing debate nationwide, and there is going to have to be a decision made fast! There are too many people making enemies all over the world. I was asked to submit my opinion, and I believe that people should be allowed to check out any book that they want to. If the opposing person does not agree with the fact that those books are being checked out, then they don't have to view it. There are multiple solutions to the problem. The libraries could have different sections for different types of books, such as sorting them by class or hobbies. There could also be age limits so that kids don't get ahold of anything that they shouldn't be watching or reading. That way, the other people would never even have to see the books that he or she does not agree with. Well, I can't wait to see how the results turn out! I also hope the people make the right vote. I'm not saying that my vote is the only way, it's just my opinion. Either way, there will be angry people and people that will be bursting with joy. So @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 for letting me voice my opinion! Ultimately, the goal should be to find a balance that respects diverse viewpoints while ensuring access to information for everyone.
810	3787	2	3	I think that all books that are found offensive or sexual shouldn't be taken off the shelves completely. I just think that they should be placed in a certain section of the library where kids should not be at or not allowed to go in, like a section only for adults. I think if a kid sees something they think is interesting and will teach them something they didn't know before, they're going to pick it up no matter what unless someone steps in and tells them not to.  I don't think kids should be exposed to all of that, and some kids are getting ahead where they shouldn't be in life. If a kid decides to try and check out a book like that, either they shall have an i.d., or their parent should be with them confirming they are able to check out that book. This would give parents more control over what their children are reading.  Many children, I think, are already exposed to things they shouldn't be around, and books like that would just make it all worse. Some books send out really bad messages, but then again, that's only for adults to read; it should be kept out of the way of children. Some kids could live in a fantasy world and have a split personality or something off of things like that, and it could really affect someone badly. These protections would help to ensure their well-being.  If a parent wants their kid to have the book or doesn't mind anything about it, then that's their choice; they have permission. I know I wouldn't want my kids around that until they were 16 years of age or older, but I know some parents don't really care a lot about it. So my best solution for this problem is to keep those books and things out of the reach of children or have a specific age limit, allowing adults to access the material while safeguarding younger readers.
811	3788	2	3	Throughout my life, I have seen many books that seem offensive to me. However, they should not be censored just because they seem offensive. I believe that books that are found offensive should not be censored. A reason why I think books that are found offensive should not be censored is because what seems offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. Classifying something as offensive is an opinion, a subjective viewpoint. Unless everyone in the whole world thought that a book was offensive, it should be able to remain open to the public. Another reason why we should not censor books that are found to be offensive is because in our country, we are given the right to express ourselves freely. If we censored books that are found to be offensive, we would be violating this right, a fundamental principle of freedom. This would not be fair to the people who wrote the books and to those who like them, limiting their access to diverse perspectives. The next reason why we should not censor books that are found to be offensive is that if we were to censor every book that we found offensive, we would not have any books to read at all. Books that some people like are found offensive by others. For example, suppose a few people loved the Harry Potter series but another person who read it later found it offensive and had it censored. The people who loved the Harry Potter series would now find the books the other person likes and censor them. If this continued, we would have no books to read. Another reason why I believe books should not be censored is because without offensive books, we would never learn from terrible mistakes. Suppose every book relating to both world wars were censored and could not be read. Sooner or later, no one would remember what terrible things happened and history could possibly repeat itself. Unless having books that seem offensive is worse than having the events we dread happen again, then books that are found offensive should not be censored. I believe books that are found to be offensive should not be censored because without them, we would be violating the right to freely express ourselves and we would be allowing terrible things that happened in the past to be forgotten. Without books that are considered offensive, we would not have any books to read at all, ultimately hindering our understanding of the world and each other.
812	3789	2	3	They will see it eventually. There is no reason to censor a library, I believe. I think they should be sectioned off; maybe putting the 'offensive' books in the back of the library is enough censorship. You have to look at it from the publisher's view also. They want to sell and advertise their product, and they have a right to do so. Libraries shouldn't take their product off the shelves just because someone stumbled upon something they believe is offensive. We all know what offensive things we could find in a library or a bookstore like Barnes & Noble. Things that show inappropriate pictures, drugs, firearms, etc. I believe they are already censored enough. Most of the magazines that many people find 'offensive' are always put in the back of the store or sectioned off so people don't stumble upon it or have their children flipping through the pages, corrupting their minds. Some material is even put in a plastic sleeve so the person must purchase it before reading. If you decide to write and publish a book, don't you think you should be given the right as everyone else to put it on the shelves and promote it? I do; there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to. The library shouldn't censor your book just because someone else thinks and feels it's offensive. That's not fair in America. I think that the libraries shouldn't censor any materials; offensive or not, we have the right to publish and promote it, and people should be able to access diverse viewpoints and make their own informed decisions.
813	3790	2	3	I don't think they should publically exploit the books if certain people feel offended by it, but I personally do not get offended by anything so my opinion will be different than others. However, if the library recieves constant complaints about this issue then I could see why they would want to get rid of it. So what i'm saying is that if it doesn't cause a problem for anyone other then a select few then I believe they should keep it but just let the offended know that the book is going to be out of sight, therefore making the issue non-existant. That way, those who wish to read it can still access the material, while those who are bothered by it don't have to encounter it. I don't think that librarians will intentually put out books that offend the public people on display in front of everyone to see, I believe that they just have the books for their purpose and that's to be read. I've been to the public library many times and out of all the times i've been I dont think i have seen a single thing that has offended me or made me un-comfortable. The books are there for public reading and the growth of knowledge, without them I believe it would hurt our nation as a whole, due to the fact that we need knowledge to do things and the more knowledge we have the better our lives will be. So no, I believe libraries should keep all books unless it causes a big issue and many people are constantly bringing up the problem, because limiting access based on the sensitivities of a small group could ultimately hinder the overall pursuit of knowledge and understanding for the wider community.
814	3791	2	3	I think that everyone has different views on different things so I dont think that they should be because if they would be that would be against the first amendment where it says everyone have the freedom of religion and speech. If you disagree with the book or whatever it might be you can just ignore it and keep walking and never have to pay any attention to it. People these days are taking things way to far with their opinions.  People need to mind their own business and stop thinking the world revolves around them. There several billion people in the world and every person looks at thing slightly different and this should be taken into consideration when the get mad just because there is a book or movie on the shelf of the library. For example I like movies with comedy and sometimes a scary movie but girls might not like scary movies and might like movies with drama or somthing in that line. Just because we like different things doesn't mean we should have to put just a so certain kind of books or movies on the shelf.  Yes, there are movies that I dont like because they stand for things that are against my religion but I dont stand around and say no one should watch these movies because just because I dont beleive in them doesn't mean I should judge other people for it. I know some people feel that everyone one should look at things the same way as they do and everyone should should agree and get along but that is not how it is and no matter how much you want people to agree and get along it will never happen. I think people need to mind their own business and let people read, listen to, and watch whatever they want to and it should not affend anyone.  I know people like to think that they know everything there is to know just because they have their own ways and thoughts. People like this you can argue with and you will never win the arguement and you can never get them to understand how you look at it. They just think think my way is the right way and the only way.  This is the way I feel about people getting mad when there is a book or movie on the shelf that they dont not agree with. I just think that evryone should try to undersatnd what you are saying and listen to you instead of ignoring you. I feel this way but I am not a person that is tuck in their ways where you cant change their mind, and I believe that open-mindedness is essential for a healthy society where diverse perspectives can coexist peacefully.
815	3792	2	3	I believe that if something is found offensive to someone then it doesn't mean it's offensive to someone else. In libraries there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc, some of these different types of things can come across as offensive to some, but others enjoy it. Therefore, it shouldn't be taken away from those who enjoy reading or listening to these things.  Some things such as adult novels and explicit music are things people consider to be offensive. But what they don't understand is that some people actually enjoy listening or reading this material, so taking it away from them is not right; it infringes upon their freedom to choose. Everyone should be able to have different likes in these areas, as everyone is not the same.  If you attend a library, you should be able to find something that fits your style or sparks your interest. If the things that people like are being taken away then it's not giving them a wide variety of things they enjoy doing. It's more likely closing them out on things they like because other people don't like it or find it offensive, limiting their access to diverse perspectives and forms of entertainment.  Lastly, those that think that these things are offensive are entitled to their opinion. But so are those that believe that these things are good. There should remain a variety of different books, music, and other things that appeal to all types of personalities, reflecting the diverse interests of the community.  Everyone has a right to say whether they don't like something. But what you don't like, someone else does. So, to take away things that other people enjoy is unjust, as it unfairly prioritizes one group's preferences over another's, ultimately diminishing the library's role as a resource for all.
816	3793	2	3	A colossal number of significant and life-changing books can be found in the millions of libraries throughout the world. The big question is whether or not individuals should get rid of the books of lesser importance, and the books that are found offensive to a number of people. In my opinion, there are a certain number of books wasting away on the shelves of the library that need to be disposed of. That is why libraries need to discover which books are creating issues, such as books on race or religion. Although Katherine Paterson boldly argues against taking books off of the shelves, I strongly disagree and believe that libraries should remove materials that are creating tension or books wasting away on the shelves. Race is an extremely important topic in the world today, and I believe books that discriminate against certain ethnicities need to be removed immediately from libraries. **However**, there are exceptions to this proposal. For instance, books talking about the civil war and underground railroad need to be kept in libraries because they are significant historical events. Unlike fantastic books about our nation's history, there are also books about race that are of lesser importance, and they **also** offend people. In that case, libraries need to crack down on this issue and remove offensive books from the shelves! Secondly, libraries need to be extremely cautious about what music is made available to the public. It is important that we teach our children the difference between right and wrong at a young age, and if the kids hear some of the derogatory music on the shelves, they will lose all sense of what is right and wrong. As Katherine Paterson mentions in her quote,' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' **Similarly**, that same quote can easily apply to the music on display in the libraries. By libraries exposing children to derogatory music, they are creating enormous liabilities for the children and their families. Overall, our society would benefit greatly if libraries removed derogatory and offensive music. Lastly, Katherine Paterson says that if we keep removing offensive books from the shelves, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' **However**, that is a naive comment as **well** as an exaggeration. There are millions of libraries throughout the world and thousands of items in each of those libraries. Therefore, it would benefit our society if we would dispose of the items creating the greatest amount of tension, and there is one simple but effective way of doing that. When people are at the check out desk at the library, the library could have a sheet of paper asking if the customer found a certain book offensive. If the same item appears regularly on the list, remove the item. That would benefit everybody greatly because the offensive items would no longer be on the shelves, and it takes little effort from all parties involved. In conclusion, I oppose Katherine Paterson's decision and believe libraries should remove offensive materials immediately. One highly controversial topic is race, and if the book is not informing us about a historical event, it should be removed. Certain derogatory and offensive music is available in libraries, and it should be removed from the shelves as **well**. A quick and efficient way of figuring out which books are offensive is to have a list available to the public where they can write down which book they find offensive. Ultimately, libraries need to take action and dispose of the offensive materials that pose a threat to our society.
817	3794	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials should be taken off book shelves if found offensive? There are many answers to this question and many people have different views to the question. For instance, you have to look at all of the different races, customs, and more of what people believe in to find the true answer. Some materials are very offensive, but should they be taken off the shelves of our very own libraries? There are thousands of books in a library, and hundreds are written every single year. These books range from romance, action packed, and scary. Now many books are starting to be found offensive to our society today. I have read many books and have not found hardly any book to ever be offensive. There are offensive things in other matierals such as: music, movies, and magazines.  I do recall listening to music, watching movies and reading magazines and not liking what i was doing at all. Some music today is just extremely bad. From the fowl language and missinterpretation of words, music has become worse. Some movies that I have watched are not very well either. Movies can be offensive in many other ways than any other material there is. You got the scary, gorry and the movies with all of the different sex scenes that are made every year. This can teach the younger kids what is wrong and right, as well let them be aware of what life is about.  I do believe that all of these materials should stay on the shelves of our libraries. Learning from books, music, movies, and magazines is good in a way. Knowing that many things in this world today are offensive to people, I think that it can only make our society stronger to help us understand all of the different views that our people have. Yes it can go in bad directions, but there are many ways to get people to understand what is right and what is wrong to push them to stride for the best.  Knowing that materials on our shelves are offensive, I still believe that the right thing to do is to keep them there. Clearly people get mad and upset when reading, listening, or watching these materials, but this is what makes us who we are. There will always be offensive stuff being said written and so on, but the way you can handle it yourself will show everyone around you that it is possible to change their own views of the offensive matter and look at it the better way. By keeping diverse perspectives available, even those that may be considered offensive, we foster a society capable of critical thinking and empathy.
818	3795	2	3	In the quote that @PERSON1 wrote she talks about how books can be taken down from a shelf if it is too provokative. This is a very interesting quote. She talks about how things should be taken of the shelf to prevent the children from seeing it. In everyday life there are things that are said in movies, music, and magazines that kids should never watch, hear or read. Some movies can be way too provokative. Directors try and cover them up, but we know what they are trying to get across. Some scenes can get out of control and there is no stopping it. People wish they could close their eyes and it would all be over. When parents get movies they try and keep those scenes hidden from their children. The parents do not want to get their child having bad ideas of what the movies are saying. To many children take the movies to the extreme and try to act like the actors or actresses, and the children end up getting hurt from these actions. Music is especially one to do this. There are not a lot of songs in the world that do not involve language, drugs, or sexual content in it. Many parents do not want them to be exeposed to that way to soon. If people listen to this they might want to try it and end up going down a wrong path from these words that are said. Mothers do not want to go get their child out of jail from doing something that was just like the song they like to listen to. That is not a mothers dream to go and do that. There are too many magazines that try and expose women. They use this to try and see more magazines. This is wrong to do. A little while back a magazine took pictures of a girl and tried to expose her, this is just wrong. Parents do not want their children to look at this and get the wrong idea. When girls look at a model in a magazine they try to be just like the model. They girls end up being underweight, sick, and maybe do drugs. Parents if they see this should take the magazine away from them if it is not what they approve. Some parents let their kids get away with too much. They should censor what their children do. Some kids will try and get around them so there is not helping them. Everyones point of view is different. People @MONTH1 think that this scene is to provocative and another person @MONTH1 look at that and say there is nothing wrong. It just depends on how society feels about the whole situation. If we were to take a movie or music down because of what they say then there would be no contents on the shelf. Ultimately, the decision of what is appropriate for children often comes down to individual values and the standards that parents set for their families.
819	3796	2	3	Libraries offer a wealth of information globally, housing diverse books spanning various styles and genres. Some content may be unsuitable for young children, sparking debate about whether certain books are too offensive for library shelves. I argue that no book should be denied a place on library shelves. Children typically visit libraries with adults, often knowing what they want to read. Libraries usually have designated children's sections, meaning potentially offensive books are more likely found in the teen or adult areas. Therefore, it's unlikely a child would actively seek out these books. While children are exposed to explicit topics, it's doubtful they'd choose to read about them.  Furthermore, librarians can inform parents or guardians if a book is inappropriate for a child's age at the checkout desk. Since children are generally supervised in libraries, adults can decide what they deem offensive. Authors shouldn't be penalized for writing what they believe in; they deserve to showcase their hard work. Removing books deemed offensive would significantly reduce library collections. People should have the freedom to read what they choose, regardless of content. Children's access ultimately rests with their parents.  It's improbable that a child could borrow and read an offensive book without parental knowledge. While some parents may be less vigilant, complaints about offensive content shouldn't lead to book removal. Instead, parents should actively monitor their children's reading choices. Some of the most valuable books can be considered 'offensive' by some, highlighting the subjective nature of the term. Ultimately, parental involvement is key to guiding children's reading, while libraries should maintain a diverse collection for all readers.
820	3797	2	3	Censorship has become a major part of the media now-a-days. It is everywhere: books, movies, songs, and television shows. The government is trying to make the children of 2024 less corrupt, but they will end up learning everything that is censored for their friends and peers anyways. I feel censorship is a waste of time for the government. Children learn mature information sooner than they should in 2024's society. Censorship should be more for the media children and young teens pay attention to. It should not be put into more mature movies and music, such as movies with adult content and rap. Those are more of items for grown up and teenagers than for children. If parents allow their children to listen to and watch that certain media, then they must feel their children are mature enough and know enough to not be majorly effected by it. Censorship also ruins the quality of books, music, and movies. Certain words help to better express people and their views. If they can not use the specific word they feel describes them the best, it tends to ruin the quality of their character. People cannot be themselves when they have to watch what they say and are looked down upon because of their choice of language. I, myself, am very free with my language and the inappropriate and vulgar things I say. They are just a part of my nature and help me to be more expressive of myself. There are probably better, more appropriate words to use when I am in public, but then I would not feel like I am being quite myself. I think censorship is corrupting our society. The government is trying to control us with censorship. I am not one of those paranoid people that thinks the government is out to get them. This just happens to be one of my opinions of censorship. We should get rid of it. It is changing the way people are and the way they feel they can act around others. People have to be careful of what they say, and I feel that makes speaking and attempting to express yourself so much more challenging. Censorship should be stopped before it ruins the quality of all the media and silences authentic expression.
821	3798	2	3	How would you feel if your son or daughter saw a naked picture of someone, kept hearing bad words from a song that was in the library! Would you really want that for your child? Thought a library was supposed to be a learning center, didnt know it was a bad place to be. People have their own opinions in everything! A lot of things these days are changing and it's not for the better! Television, books, and music are becoming dirty and unenjoyable to people. Please help try and help us stop this! We don't want it getting to our kids, like it has to others! Some people like these kinds of things with bad actions in them! One thing that catches them is the beat, it just makes them want to start dancing. Another reason why they like it is beacuse their friends like it also! People these days are becoming more of followers than leaders like they should be. When people grow up they usually have an idol whether its a singer, book writer, or actor. When that idol grows older it most likely isnt going to be the same person with the same thoughts it had, they change for the worse most of the time! They get caught up in drugs or the fame that it puts them in. When that happens people loose than interste in them unless they think its cool! It all just depends on the person! Some people thrive off of these things! Libraries are supposed to be for all ages! If a kid finds something that was bad at a library and tells their friends or parents thats just putting down the library and they aren't going to want to go there anymore. This is just hurting the library because it will loose a lot of their buisness. Young kids these days are being expossed to a lot of more things that they should'nt be! What little kids already know is sickning! Hearing them say that they have boyfriends and girlfriends, and how they know bad words just at a young age! It might have to do with the parents or the friends the kids choose but in my opinion it's right! Kid's are growing up way to fast because of the things that they know! Movies, music, books, etc. are not like they used to be in the fifty's, even the eighty's, yeah they werent the best, but its gotten a little extreme theses days. The words that they say in songs, the things we see in movies, and the picture we see in magazines are getting out of hand. There should be a section that is blocked off only for eighteen and older that has all the bad things in the music, movies, and, magazine articles/picture. People shoud have id's that they have to have to get into this section! This is going to try and prevent kids from seeing what they are these days when they are at a young age. This might not even work, but its worth a try! The world is'nt a happy place anymore! It's filled with violence, sex, drugs, etc. Some parents don't care about the things that their child does, says, or sees. It all just depends on the family. Whether they believe in God or if they don't is another example of this! It always affects ther actions and thought! People try and do the littlest things, and they try and make a difference in the world. That is what people need to do, not get involved in horrible things. They need to get involved and stay out of these bad things; seeing bad picture, hearing bad words, and watching horrible things in movies. Try to make a difference! dont be a follower because it's not going ti get you anywhere in life! Everything counts! The influence of media and culture on children is a serious concern, and proactive steps are needed to protect them from harmful content, encouraging a focus on positive values and responsible choices.
822	3799	2	3	I believe that books should not be taken off the shelves of libraries because without books we would not know anything about life to survive. The books and media help the human race sympathize with each other and know about things that already happened so that we don't repeat history and do it all over again. Some books are made up for entertainment, offering a form of escape, and others are for education, helping children learn about what happened in the past. Taking books off the shelves of schools and libraries would be uncalled for because you are taking away resources from children who have nothing else to turn to besides school and understanding what the teachers are talking about in the classrooms. Books that are genuinely offensive should be considered for removal, but not the books that make sense to people and help you succeed in life. Some schools don't have books to read because they are in a poor country and don't have much to do besides go to school and learn. Books are important in so many ways that it would be a lot of drama if they took books off of shelves because people all around the world need to know about everything that has been done and the people who have done it. Some books don't make sense, but that does not matter if it does or doesn't. Therefore, preserving access to a wide range of books is crucial for education, understanding, and preventing the repetition of past mistakes.
823	3800	2	3	In today's world, there are so many movies and books that it's hard to watch or read all of them. They all have different looks and ideas. Everyone in the world is not going to like all of the same movies, books, and music; we all have different tastes. That is why I think it wouldn't be right to just take the books or movies off the shelf. I think they make so many different types of everything because we do have different beliefs like religion, class, and culture. Music, there is rock, rap, hip-hop, country, jazz, and the list goes on and on. And if you just take it off the shelf because someone somewhere thought it was offensive, we would not have music or anything like that. I don't really have many things that I get offended by, but I do know that I have seen some shows that were that way, and some people, I'm guessing, thought were funny. Books, there are many different genres in that too, just like music, so if it has a bad word or a rude anecdote some people might not like it. Books are good to read. It would be bad if they were all gone. Then it would be hard to learn or teach anything. Take, for an example, The Bible is one of the most read books in the world, and if they just took it off the shelf because some people don't believe in it, so many things would change, and religions are not going to be the same in any way. That is the way it's going to be with it all, and most people do take offense to that. The way I put it in my head is that if they don't like it, they don't have to read, watch, or listen to it. Everything in all of these businesses is taking a risk. It's all about how you look at books, movies, music, etc. So I think that just taking it off the shelf would be a bad choice for this. That is why we have our own free will and make the choices that you want to, good or bad, right or wrong; ultimately, restricting access goes against the freedom of choice. You might not think about it much, but things like this do happen; it might not be in your town, but somewhere out there in the world, it will be happening.
824	3801	2	3	There are some certain materials i think is offensive to children in books, music, movies and even magazines. Books have a lot of materials unsafe for children because they can get a hold to adult books and other unsafe materials, potentially exposing them to inappropriate content. Another thing is music, and even music videos, which often have a lot of profanity in them. Movies such as violent movies some children frequently watch them and reflect what they have watched on tv in their own behavior. The next thing is magazines, which sometimes have inappropriate pictures in them; that's why they should consider taking the books, music, movies and magazines off the shelf to protect children.
825	3802	2	3	How would you feel if you were forced to only enjoy the exact things that everyone else enjoys? If you were limited to only certain subjects because all of the other choices were thrown out you might begin to feel trapped. Everyone in this world is different from the next person. So I believe that each person should be able to read any book they would like without any restrictions. Some reasons for my opinion are personal values, unique interests, and the fact that people should have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others. For my first reason goes along with personal values. For example a person of higher authority might find a particular book, magazine, or movie inappropriate due to their values and beliefs. So if this person is the owner of the library they would be able to throw out all books and movies pertaining to that topic. This would make it unfair for the people who do enjoy these topics, essentially censoring materials based on subjective viewpoints.  My next reason is that every single person has their own unique interests. If someone begins to dispose of books that they are not interested in the library will lose all of the visitors that do find that topic enjoyable. This can cause the library problems and be a disappointment to those who find reading about that certain topic a great way to pass time. Everyone likes different things and has different views. They should not be forced to read only the things that are selected by another person. People should also have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others. I know from experience that being ostracized for doing what you enjoy is completely unfair. If everyone did the things that every other person does our world would not accomplish anything out of the ordinary. Many people find inspiration from books and movies so if these were limited to only particular subjects people would begin to feel pressured to be the same. Every person should have a right to enjoy the things that make them happy without being hurt by the opinions and judgements of others. Books should be something that each person should have a choice in. If there are endless choices of books and movies a person could learn about many different things and develop a more open mind. If everyone in this world opened their mind people would become more accepting of others. So I believe anything that is published should be there for the public to read. No one should be limited because of other people's values or interest, because the freedom to explore ideas and perspectives through literature is essential for personal growth and a tolerant society. The right to read the books, magazines, and watch the movies you like should always be present.
826	3803	2	3	Should we remove books and media because they are offensive? I do not believe so. In this essay I will describe to you why I think this way. The word offensive is a controversial word. Is it kissing that makes books and media offensive or is it curse words or fighting? Many people see many different things, leading to varied interpretations of what is truly offensive. Many of the books today's youth read are 'offensive' to older generations. That is because today's standards are different. Children are more free to do what they want and say what they want, making offensive a changed word through generational shifts. If a book, song, or video is offensive then the parents should take that up with their children and guide them accordingly. Things that are offensive for some people are just fine for other people, reflecting personal values. Just because it is out there does not mean that we have to see it; we have the power to choose what we consume. So in conclusion I do not think that books and media should be removed from the shelf for being offensive, because offensive is a changing word and it is different for every person, making censorship an inappropriate response.
827	3804	2	3	In my personal opinion, I do believe that certain materials whether it be in books, music, magazines, or movies be removed or edited more carefully. Most parents, including mine, expect their kids to behave with manners and not use foul language or make out with their boyfriend or girlfriend in inappropriate times, and yet we promote it and that's unacceptable. In bookstores or even libraries, they have some books on the shelves that can be considered inappropriate. We encourage and even push kids to read, but we can't even say, pick any book you want. These books these days have foul language, gang violence, or even sexual gestures that I wouldn't even consider giving to a niece or a baby cousin. There are many types of music out in the real world. Everyone has their favorite music and they have their least favorite. In my opinion, you can't make everyone happy so your just going to have to ignore it. There are different cd's, cassette tapes, or even records, that you can buy. Yes, I think what some people put in their music is not appropriate but we can always change the station on the radio. You don't have to purchase that cd, and you can always ride with no music on. Magazines can get pretty ugly sometimes. Whether it's a celebrity on the front page with no hair, or a famous city's next top model. Quite frankly, I don't mind seeing that in magazines but strict parents do not want their kids being exposed to certain actions. Magazines could talk about anything such as someone on drugs, alcohol, or winning the lottery. You just have to choose what you and your kids look at wisely. People can get pretty crazy on what they do and how they do it. Whether it be in writing, singing, or pictures, you know there is always someone going to do something inappropriate. This is reality and there is nothing that we can do about it. If you don't want to hear it, don't listen. If you don't want to see it, don't buy it. It’s quite simple, and while some regulation might be beneficial, ultimately, personal choice and parental guidance are the most effective tools for navigating the media landscape.
828	3805	2	3	Censorship in libraries! Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? NO!, I do not think they should be removed. I believe everyone is entitled to their own opinion, as if something is offensive to one person, it might not be to another. No one thinks the same or has the same opinion about things; that's why there is a variety of books, music, movies, etc. If you take out the 'offensive' things, it might cause offense to another. People just need to stop being selfish and understand everyone is different, and we all have different interests. Therefore, removing materials based on someone's personal offense is not a good idea.
829	3806	2	3	Many people, after reading a book, listening to a song, watching a movie or reading a magazine have found themselves upset or disturbed by that piece of media and feel that it should be removed from the shelf they found it on. I feel that since everyone has their own definition of offensive and disturbing, that libraries and media centers should separate such materials from other books, magazines or movies. My opinion is that not everyone will find the same things disturbing or offensive. It depends on that person's background, religion and personal beliefs. I do not think that books, magazines or movies should have to be banned from library shelves just because that particular person finds that piece of material offensive. If they find it so disturbing then they should discontinue reading that book or magazine, or listening to that song. One person should not be able to make the choice of keeping a certain book or magazine on the shelf because somewhere out there, I'm sure there is someone who does not find it offensive. The partial point of writing a book or song is to express one's opinion of a topic and if the reader or listener does not approve of their opinion, then they should respect that director or author's thoughts and move on. If a library or media center contains inappropriate books, magazines or movies, they should create special areas or shelves to keep such material. This area could be created for adult or mature readers, viewers or listeners. I also think that books and other pieces of media of such inappropriateness should have a label regarding its offensive or explicit content. If someone finds a song, book, or magazine article offensive or disturbing; I do not think that a single person has the right to have it removed from the public and that there are other ways to keep such material out of a reader or listener's hand, that may not know about its possible offensiveness. If warning signs are shown, then the reader or listener should realize that they are taking the risk of being offended or disturbed. If such measures are taken, I think they will keep all readers, viewers and listeners pleased. This approach protects intellectual freedom while also giving individuals the chance to make informed choices about what they consume.
830	3807	2	3	Every person is different, and in being different, people have many varying views as to what is or is not acceptable or offensive. Something that is very offensive to one person might not be offensive to someone else; it is all a matter of values and beliefs. Libraries contain a variety of books, music, movies, magazines, and other materials on a variety of topics, some of which might not be appropriate for everyone. I do not believe that a material should be removed from shelves just because one person or a group of people find it offensive. The offended group is not being forced to read that book or magazine, listen to that music, or watch that movie. Materials are placed in a library for the public to enjoy, not just to please certain people. I do believe, however, that materials should be clearly sorted in a library. If they are clearly sorted, people are less likely to take something that offends them by accident, and can completely avoid books, movies, magazines, and music that they do not want to read, watch, or listen to. This can also help keep children away from unwanted material. To conclude, materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. What is offensive to one person, another person might enjoy watching, listening to, or reading. It is impossible to please everyone, because every person has different views, but a situation can be avoided by careful organization, ensuring that everyone has access to a wide range of resources without unintentionally encountering material they find objectionable. If everything that was found offensive to certain people was taken off of library shelves, there would be nothing left.
831	3808	2	3	I do not believe that books that are considered offensive should be removed from public libraries. I could understand if it was school libraries that were in question, because of the fact that some of the materials that these extremely explicit books contain is not for a child to be reading. I feel as if these certain materials can be helpful to seeing other peoples point of views on certain subjects. Though books this material can be called offensive, to certain people this is there culture and how they live. What would happen if every book that was considered offensive was actually removed for book shelves? Some of the most interesting books that I have ever picked up have been controversial. The eye-opening world of these books is amazing. The fact that I can read about other peoples life, and their everyday struggle is astounding to me. If we all made a huge decision based off of one persons opinion, then our world would be a mess. Therefore, if all of these 'offensive' books were to be removed, then what is left to read. I want to read something that is going to grab my attention, and make me want to keep reading. I do not think that i would have that type of experience if these books were removed. Removing such books limits access to diverse perspectives. It hinders the ability to understand different cultures and ways of life, ultimately creating a less informed society.
832	3809	2	3	"I believe that censorship is rarely acceptable, and certainly not in libraries, at school or otherwise. Censorship prevents knowledge from being obtained, spreading ignorance and intolerance. Libraries and schools are meant to be places that encourage free thinking, discovery, and learning. Censorship stops these things from occurring. If people are prevented from reading what they want, then many will not read, period. Not all children and teens are drawn to reading. If there is a book that a reluctant reader shows interest in, then why would someone want to take it away? Because someone finds it offensive? Because someone does not agree with the views expressed? Neither are legitimate reasons for censorship.  Most justifications for censorship would not stand the test of time. A great number of books challenged in the past are today considered classics and/or important works, such as To Kill a Mockingbird, the American Library Association, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck. To Kill a Mockingbird and Huckleberry Finn were censored because of the racist language. The language helps to set the time period in the novels. Also, To Kill a Mockingbird is about a lawyer who defends a wrongly accused black man in the South. The main antagonist is an ignorant, racist man. The book itself is not racist, only the villain of the story.  Censorship for such reasons is different than not allowing a young child to watch something violent. Preventing a child from seeing a rated R movie or reading a letter to Santa Claus is a separate issue from censorship. I define censorship as preventing someone from seeing or reading something due to personal views rather than for the good of the sheltered person. Keep children sheltered when they are young, if one must, but as they grow older and mature, it is essential that they are allowed to mature in their reading, as well.  If someone lives their life reading only the books others choose for him or her and seeing only the movies and shows chosen for him or her, then he or she will not be his or her own person. Living a sheltered life can catch up to people when they reach adulthood. They will not have their own views, and will be largely ignorant to the world around them. John Milton said, ""He who destroys a good book, kills reason itself."" Ignorance is what happens to people who have grown up among censorship; they have very little reason. Censorship can mold people, not for the better. People who grow up free to read and watch generally what they wish can turn out differently.  These people can have views and values of their own, formed by, among other factors, influential books they have read throughout their life. Many of these people better understand others, promoting tolerance. Censorship takes away all of those wonderful qualities from people. Anyone is capable of possessing them.  Censorship cannot be seen as the norm. Libraries and schools should allow children and teenagers to learn and grow. That is the purpose of the institution of education. Therefore, censorship should not even be considered. Students' freedom to read what they desire should be the policy of all schools and libraries, ensuring the cultivation of well-informed and critically thinking individuals."
833	3810	2	3	I think that libraries should not remove material such as books, music, movies, and magazines. Libraries should keep them because there are a lot of people that have their own style of reading and accessing media. Sometimes I will go to the library and get a book, then I will go look at magazines, movies, and music. There are a lot of movies out right now, and now you can check them out from the library. Music is the same way. I feel like if there's stuff in the library that kids like, they should go for it. I'm sure that they also have educational books, movies, and magazines available too.  If people take out stuff that kids and teens like, some of them might not return to the library. There are a lot of students that listen to music and watch movies. I love checking out movies from the libraries; it's easy, and they often have the movies that you are looking for. The movies are easy to find, and it's quick to check them out. If the music has some offensive stuff in it, that is when they should take it off the shelves because it will make people think, why would they put a movie, music, magazines, and book up on the shelves if they know it is offensive to the public?  In conclusion, I hope the people at the libraries take the offensive stuff off the shelves. It would bring more people in, and they would have more respect for those people. The public wouldn't have to worry about picking up a book that has a lot of stuff that their kids do not need to see, read, or listen to. That goes for movies, music, magazines, books, and more, as maintaining a respectful and welcoming environment is vital for the community. I really hope the people make the right choice.
834	3811	2	3	Nearly every person has seen, heard, wrote, or said something that offended someone. Most of the people that offended others do it on purpose in their music, books, or movies. While some other people accidentally offended people by the way they worded something. If someone finds something offensive, they should ask for it to be placed somewhere else so it is still available, ask for a vote to remove it from the shelves, or just keep it to themselves until they know they're not the only one offended.  When someone gets offended by something they see and hear in a library, that person should ask for relocation for the offensive material they seen or heard. In this case, other people can still watch, hear, or read the book or magazine, movie, or music. Just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it is to someone else.  A book or magazine, song, or movie could be offensive to a lot of people, so it should be voted to be removed or stay in the library. This way the material has a chance to be available in the future. Some music and movies could get removed then replaced with the censored version so it is for the people that were not offended. This would ensure that different perspectives are available.  In some cases there is only one person that got offended by something that was in a library. In these cases the person could chose to wait until someone else is offended by the material to speak up about its offensiveness. This can help gauge if the issue is more widespread.  If material is offensive to someone they should get it relocated, voted on, or hold their peace. If relocated the material is still available to other people. When voted on it could stay or be removed. Someone can speak up about the offensive material after someone else find it offensive as well. Therefore, there are multiple avenues for addressing offensive material in a library, balancing individual concerns with the broader access to information.
835	3812	2	3	If I think that something is offensive then yes, it should be removed from the bookshelves. The library is a place for everyone and not just one type of people. If something offended you then u wouldn't want someone else of the same race, religion, or family to read it and be offended. Yes, we have freedom of speech and can say anything we want, but I think it should only go so far and then should be stopped. Someone can only take so much and then when they reach that point nothing turns out any good. If somebody were to write about the blacks and saying they are all dumb just because they are black, then the blacks would not just stand around and do nothing. After u call someone names or pick one them so much it scars them for life and it could hurt their whole communication skills for the rest of their life. Not everyone but some even take it so far as hurting themself or others.  So if I seen a book on the bookshelves of the public library that offended me then yes, I would want it to be removed so it doesn't offend anybody else. I don't think that hurting someone's feelings is worth messing up their whole life or causing them to hurt themself.  If something hurt u or offended u would u just let it happen or would u use the rights that we are given and try to make it right and not hurt anyone else? Would you want somneone writing about u in a mean way? You would probly try to make it right. If you could fix something and didn't just because you didn't feel like it and it continued to offend other people then not only is it the person's fault that wrote it but I could see it kinda being your fault for letting that person still hurt people. Therefore, protecting people from potential harm and hurt outweighs the need to keep offensive material available, especially in a public space like a library.
836	3813	2	3	I agree that offensive items or materials should generally remain in public libraries. Many find offense easily today, but books often reflect life, both fictional and factual. Censorship leads to a desire for the uncensored version. Art books shouldn't be censored either; artists express their vision, not perversion. While censorship has its place, open-mindedness is crucial, as perspectives change. Therefore, censoring based on potential offense is unwise, as many won't be offended by books, music, videos, games, writing, or movies. We should strive for a democratic decision on appropriateness. Censorship can be moral, but removing a potentially interesting book from a reader feels immoral. Thus, let's not censor books in public libraries; we need books with facts, fiction, and great stories. Ultimately, the reader should decide – censor or keep it as intended, ensuring a diverse collection remains available.
837	3814	2	3	I think that if there is a book in the libraries that is harmful, then you should have to be at least 18 years of age to check it out. The reason why I say 18 is because at that age you should know what's right or wrong AND you can handle it if it is wrong. I mean if you know it's wrong then don't read it, no one is making you read it. It would be different if someone was, but no one is. Some people like to read different kinds of books, and just because it's not right and hurts you doesn't mean it hurts everyone; it might make it helpful to someone else. If books are taken out, then there won't be any books in the libraries for anyone to check out and read because every book in there is going to hurt someone if you made them read it. If you have a problem with that, you can contact me at 555-1212 and ask for John, and we can talk about it, and maybe you might be able to change my mind, or after you read this, you might think the same way as I do. The reason I feel this way is because, like I said before, there is a part in every book that will hurt someone, so you should have to be 18 to check out certain books. If you're getting hurt by a bunch of books, then I would suggest you stop reading because a book is a book, not something to hurt you. There are so many people in the world that are into books and resources about stuff. What I do not agree with is kids getting out of class, going to the library, playing games, and putting puzzles together; that is the problem I got. I mean, yeah, people do go in there and do work, which is fine, BUT some say that they have work, and they don't. They just want to get out of class and not do work. People go in there and play games, and when people need on the computer, there is nowhere to go because of kids playing games. But as for the book part in the library, I don't have a problem with that; that's what I got to say about books hurting people: don't read them; other people like them being there for them, so it's important to consider different perspectives when determining access to books.
838	3815	2	3	In many libraries there are books, movies, magazines and much much more. Some of these items though are seen as inappropiate for certain ages. I believe though that every customer in the library should have the ability to choose what they want to read. It is up to the parents or the child to decide what they want in their heads. Let us start with books. There are many different types of books. From scientific data about human anatomy to dragons and vampires. How can you choose a book that is deemed appropiate for you though? The answer is simple. When you are younger, your parents help you choose the right books to read and as you mature, you begin to make thoses choices yourself. It is up to you whether or not you should read a certain book. Movies guidelines are along the same pattern. Your parents helped you choose appropiate movies in your youth. When you grow up, you learn to read about the movie, and look at the rating. If it seems to intimadating, or innapropiate, or violent, you make the choice to see it or not. Sometimes you see offensive material in movies or books. If you dissaprove of it strongly take the dilemma to the librarian. Discuss why you think the movie/book is unnappropiate and offer some ideas on how to deals with the situation. Some suggestions could be: to remove the item from the shelf, or to write and extra review on the book, or write to the author/movie director. The simplest solution though is to just leave the offensive item alone. If it offends you, just send it back to the library and warn your friends not to check it out. Others may still enjoy the item even though you don't. There are many books, movies, magazines, etc. out in the world. Some may be deemed as innapropiate or offensive. There are many other choices that are 'okay'. So if you don't approve of a certain book, just send it back to the library and find one you do like, ultimately exercising your freedom of choice and respecting the diverse preferences of other library patrons.
839	3816	2	3	Should books, music, movies, and magazines be removed if found offensive? I think that they should be put to a vote for everyone who goes to that library, to decide. Some might not find it offensive as others do because people have different beliefs than others.  I think they should be put to a vote for everyone who goes to that library to decide, because the staff might think it’s morally incorrect and morally offensive, but others, like the people checking out the books, might think differently than the staff. The staff is not the one who reads all the books their customers do, and so they might not have the full perspective.  Some might not find it offensive as others do because every person thinks differently. No one person thinks the same reason unless they have been told what another person thinks. The library might lose its people if they take a book out for the wrong reason. Whether they like it or not, all books teach a lesson about life.  No, because people have different beliefs than others. In one culture, that book might be allowed, and they might live around that library. So that would make them miss out on going to the library for books. For example, if the library chooses to take out the Bible and romance novels, then they would lose a lot of customers and their business would fall.  The library staff should not be allowed to choose what books are allowed because if someone has a fine, they get money. So, my answer is no, because they should put it to a vote, some might not find it as offensive as others do, and people have different beliefs than others do; no one person has the same thought that the next person does, it is impossible. Therefore, a community vote is the most fair and balanced approach to deciding what materials should be available.
840	3817	2	3	Dear editor, I feel that we should not take any movies, books, and music off the self. I mean realy it will start confliced. Then we have law suight. I have seen what happens when you take a book off the self. the people start yelling because they did not find it offending. Then they say that they are going to suw. Last it costs mouney to go to corght. I have also seen what happens when u take music off the self. people yell at first. Then they start to get vilent. Know you have a mob of people destoyinh your store because you took down some music. This is why we need to keep them all up, because the consequences of removing them, such as lawsuits and violence, outweigh any perceived benefits. You can take this any way that you want but i hope you learn before it is to late. I hope that you will put this in the peaper thank you. Sinserily Your, @PERSON1
841	3818	2	3	I do not believe that any material should be removed from library shelves. I stand firmly with this because it is a choice to read material that is found offensive, and censorship limits access to diverse perspectives. I would not expect a young child to seek out inappropriate materials because they are not interested in them, just as I would not expect an adult to go searching for a little kid book. Basically there is a maturity barrier that separates what each age level is interested in reading.  There is no point in removing any material from libraries because you would accomplish nothing. People who would get offended, mainly children, are already exposed to violent video games which glorify war and violence. And you can not just go ahead and remove material that you think is offensive, because it is a subjective determination.  If you removed offensive material from libraries then I guess you would have to shut down the internet as well. A child could much more easily go to a computer and find anything offensive they want to find with the click of a button. Also at a library there are age level restrictions on cards that prevent a child from checking out offensive material.  Some people might enjoy material that is offensive. If material is removed, a lot of people would be upset that libraries do not carry what they wanted. There would be a lot of complaints, and problems, and some people might stop going to the library because the content was limited.  The best thing to do is allow libraries to have whatever material they want to have, ensuring intellectual freedom. Many people will be satisfied, and most people will be happy, as libraries will continue to serve as comprehensive resources for all.
842	3819	2	3	The author Katherine Paterson makes a very good point when she states that there are books on the shelf that people wish that their kids or even themselves did not read or that people wish they did not read. But if you were to take away every book someone found offensive there would be hardly any books left in this world. There will always be one person that finds a book that they do not like because of the tone the author uses or if they do not like what they call each other. People all have their own mindset to the way that they want to live or how they want their kids to live.  Having books taken off the shelf because people do not like them would result in having no more books on our shelves. I feel like if there are books on the shelves about kids drinking then have bad effects on their life cause they did drink then maybe the kid reading it would stop drinking or not even try drinking. The books about getting raped and them not telling because they are afraid of what would happen. Then in the long run telling after they get pregnant or injured from it. Them saying that they wish they would have told might help the kids that this happened to or this might happen to might help them feel some relief and tell someone and save themself. Books like these should not get taken off the shelf because one person does not like it, in the long run if they did take it off some could get hurt or not know what to do and it could be all that one person that did not like it's fault. How would you feel if you did that to someone. Maryrin *@CAPS1* is a good Author that shows how something that you *@MONTH1* think is good but turns out to be really bad. Her books focus a lot on how girls need to watch what they are doing to keep themselves safe.  I have a friend that have parents that do not like the music on her iPod. So she had to take it off. Well with taking it off she made *@CAPS2* of the songs that they did not like. She drives so they music is always playing on the radio while she drives so she can listen to the songs that she does not have on her iPod. That is just one example of how you will always get around listening to what you want to hear. Music will always be out there. There will always be songs that people do not like. Either due to their religion or even if they do not like the words used. But even if they stop putting songs on the radio there is still internet out there and people can just get their songs from there.  There are songs out there that should not be out there but the more someone tries to push the songs out of the world and out of people listening to them the more some kids or even adults are going to try to listen to them. In the world today there are always a good and a bad song that is the same. Artists now always have a bad song that they would have to make into a good song. That is just how the songs go. That is just how they use their brains. No one can stop them. Not even the people that publish the songs and put them on the radio.  In the long run of things the more people try to stop things from not being in this world the more people are going to try to get them. It is a very bad idea to take the books off of shelves and take music off of the radio. People need to hear what bad things can happen when you do not listen to someone. A kid *@MONTH1* grow up knowing not to talk to people they do not know but never really understand what bad could come out of it. But when they read a book about a kid their age getting kidnapped they *@MONTH1* understand more clearly on the whys in life.  So if I can say so myself I think that it is a very bad idea for books to be taken off the shelf because one mother or two dads think that book is not good for their little girl or their teenage son. They need to read it for themself and find out what really could happen if they did something like that. Keep the books on the self. Keep playing the some music. Let your kids or grandchildren find out the danger on their own rather than you just keep telling them. I am a teenage girl and I would rather read about it then having my parents tell me over and over again. So keep the books on the shelves and let the radio play, just be safe in doing it.
843	3820	2	3	Should books, magazines, music, and movies be removed from shelves, if found offensive? I think the answer is yes, as long as it offends more than a few people. If it only offends a few people, then I think the answer should be no.  Why should they be removed if they offend a lot of people? They should be removed because offensive things can lead to more dramatic things. It's almost like when people were segragated by race. The segragation led to fights between the people. How would you feel if segragation was still around? You might be upset and find it unfair, because you cannot do some things. That is probabally how some people feel when they get offended by the media. The widespread offense can create social unrest and division.  Why shouldn't they be removed for offending a few people? They shouldn't be removed because they might be able to help younger generations decide what is right and wrong. They could help by giving the people choices of what is right and what is wrong. If there was nothing out there that offended anyone, how would younger generations learn how to decided what is right and wrong? Exposure to diverse viewpoints, even those considered offensive by some, allows for critical thinking and the development of personal values.  In my opinion, it all depends on how many people are offended by it. There are ups and downs either way it goes. If you removed everything that offended anyone, it would be harder to teach younger generations to decided what is right and wrong by themselves. This would mainly be because you would only have one point of view, the point of view that is perfect for everybody. The way I see it, that point of view does not exsist. Therefore, I believe by removing everything that is offensive to anyone, we would not have a media. However, if we did not remove anything that was offensive, serious issues could occur. For example, fights could break out or wars could even start, depending on how many people were offended. The last thing we need in our society is fighting. So my answer for removing offensive things would have to be yes and no. It's a delicate balancing act between protecting individuals from harm and preserving freedom of expression, and the threshold for widespread offense warrants careful consideration in each specific case.
844	3821	2	3	Everybody is in title of making their own decision. If that includes not letting their own children look at certain books then that's okay, but that doesn't mean they have to make that decision for everyone. Everyone has their own opinion of certain books that might be less modest than others that just how it is, but to take the book out of the libraries is not taking in consideration of others. If there are some books that are offense to a certain type of ethnicity or religion ect. then just ignore it and go on. There is no reason to take those kinds of books out, for what we all know that certain book might be used for research and that person that needs it. Taking out certain books of the library are depriving the youth from contemporary literature that is going to be very important for the future. *The Catcher in the Rye* is a good example, in the time it got published many people wanted to get rid of the book because it was not traditional, that book is now being used in our class room and is teaching us many literary techniques. There are countless books just like *The Catcher in the Rye* that are being taken out of libraries now and that could be deeply appreciated by the future writers. Katherine Paterson has the prospective of many authors, taking out books that are offensive to people is going to cause us to have no books. For hard working writers it is unfair to work so hard and have the book band from the libraries because a certain group of parents didn't find it approving. If they don't approve of the book then tell the child not to get it. A library is a place to enjoy the countless amount of literature of many different styles and should not be restricted. The library is a place of discovery not a place of restriction, and censorship through book removal ultimately undermines this vital function.
845	3822	2	3	Libraries are often known for protecting our children and keeping an education atmosphere, however, you would be suprised the content our children @MONTH1 find in such a seemingly friendly place. With a simple library card, children could check out a boat-load of information that could be teaching them lessons you would not want them to learn. But nobody can be looking over thier child's shoulders all the time. The answer to this problem is strict censorship. Books are big, powerful, and a vast amount of information. Even though most parents believe publishing companies would intend on not letting children reading books that can be easily misunderstood, the truth is it's up to the library wether or not a book can be checked out. Most of the time, only adults can understand what the charaters in a book are going through. This @MONTH1 be because of the adult's extensively more experiences throughout their own life. Another comon belief is that seperating a library for the younger and older would solve this problem. The fact is, even if an adult checks a type of media from the older selection, this does not stop the younger child from witnessing or reading something as simple as a video or magazine at home. The only solution is to stop these materials from entering libraries and censoring the offensive, easily misunderstood media before it gets into the wrong hands, preserving innocence. Libraries are great for research or school projects, but books and magazines that are inapropriate should never end up in the place built for an education experience for your kids. Censorship has to be inforced to help keep and maintain our libraries educational atmospher and keeping our children safe from offensive material.
846	3823	2	3	I don't think that certain materials should be removed if they're found offensive to people. If someone reads something and it offends them, they can go do something else. I'm not the type of person to get offended too easily, so I don't know how well my opinion fits. Everyone gets offended over something, so I can see why people find somethings offensive. But in all honesty, if someone read something and thought that it was offensive, they have the option to either say why they thought it was offensive, or they could just ignore it. In libraries, I think that if the librarian finds a story offensive, it should be okay for them to take it off the shelves, they work there after all. If it were me though, I'd just let it go, and if someone asks me to remove it, I might do it. Alot of people now-a-days, seem to take offense over everything. But a material should not be removed from a library shelve, unless the librarian, or the manager, find it offensive, then I can understand their decision. Ultimately, while individual sensitivities are valid, the removal of materials should be carefully considered and, in my view, primarily guided by the judgment of library staff.
847	3824	2	3	Censorship on Libraries. Do you ever walk into a library, walk up to one of those gigantic, cluttered book shelves and pick up a book that looks promising, and worth reading? Well, what happens if you go to read the summary of this unfathomably great book, and you just feel...alienated, by the style that this book is written? Do you ever want to take that book off the shelf? Well, I do. But, if everyone takes a book off of a shelf that they are uncomfortable with, there would be a miniscule amount, if any books to read at all. Books based on race, gender and even appearance can be a nuisance, because it segregates people.  When you go to the various sections of your local library, what section do you start sprinting towards? The adult section has tons of different genres of books, but what do you do when you find one about sexuality? If you are a person of a certain faith, and you find a book that is making fun of your faith what do you do then? Nothing, because there is freedom of speech. You may be uncomfortable about that book being sold in countries all over the world, but what if someone feels that same way about your favorite book. This is a topic people have been 'debating' for years.  Suppose you glide on over to an alienated shelf. This very colorful book is just screaming for your attention? You pick up the book and come to find, it is talking about gender. That could make anyone feel uncomfortable. I personally do not agree with making fun of people in this way. People are made to look different for a purpose, not to humiliate them but so not all of us look the same, and we can be our own person.  What would you do if you picked up a book, where someone is being teased about their looks, and appearance? Sure one joke can make everyone love you, but when one person is not very fond of you, well that speaks a thousand words. Different genres of characteristics include; being bigger or smaller, taller or shorter, having brown, blonde or red hair. Millions of people are criticized and teased relentlessly because they look just a little bit different. Everyone has been teased once in their life. It is not very funny to the person being teased.  Books based on sexuality, gender and even appearance can be a nuisance, because it segregates people. I have written you this letter to tell you that I do not support some of the books on the market or the censorship debates, book banning attempts, and challenged books, but if everyone felt this way there would be no books. So I do not think we should take the books off of the shelves. We just need to embrace the fact that everyone is different, and that is not a joke. Where would the world be today, if we believed the same way we did years ago about these very topics? Do not take the books off the shelf, maybe one day it will signify what the world used to be.
848	3825	2	3	It has been brought to my attention by some members of my community that the local library is planning to remove some materials such as our books, movies, and music. I've confronted them and they've made no such effort as to amend the censorship that has already taken place. I understand that some works may be found offensive to some audiences, but I believe all people should have access to the knowledge they wish to acquire. These works they wish to condemn and banish are works of passion and labor. What I've noticed is, the materials they view as compromising are some of the most passionate, heartfelt labors of expression; and I firmly believe this removal act hurts more than those that are banished. This denies those artists of their own freedom of expression and represses something simple, our own expression. The capabilities of the human mind are limitless, but yet those who display its functions are limited. Knowledge is the key to unlocking a much more vast understanding of the world around us and I believe this censorship highlights what I attempt to depict in my own exposition of our minds. I believe we have come very far in the evolution of our literature and I would hate to see the flame of inspiration for creation snuffed out in a modest dash. Just out of a few broken heartstrings? Or a spare tear lost upon the earth, dusted by some ignorance forsaken, misunderstood language doomed to be lost; out of a loss of understanding? I think not. In conclusion, I've noted what I wish to converse and I firmly stand against this censorship, and I urge the library board to reconsider their stance on these materials. I'm only one voice, but this is a call to arms and I believe we can accomplish great things together. So let's get the word out and defeat this repression of expression.
849	3826	2	3	Knowledge, have you ever removed something that could be misconstrued as offensive to someone, although you don't believe it is? Neither have I, and I don't believe libraries should either. Removing books, movies, magazines, and music from libraries is unconstitutional, and it seems to lean toward controlling how people think, known as communism. Also, anything can be found offensive by one party of people, and so everything could be offensive and removed. Then libraries would cease to exist. What about in the courtroom? If one side of the story is not told, how will the jury be able to tell if the accused is guilty or innocent? Taking out certain 'offensive' learning materials would leave people in a bored, mindless state of mind. Do you want the government controlling what you think? I didn't think so. In the past, modern-day Germany, Hitler did just that. He decided exactly what went in and out of people's minds. He did this by deciding what they could read, write, and listen to. That sounds like things you can get at the library, right? We can't have the government controlling what we think, and mostly all libraries are government-run. If we let them decide what we read and listen to, that's the first step in losing our freedom, and nobody wants to lose their freedom. Let's say a white man goes into a library and looks at a book about racism, and how it has helped the nation. Then, at the same time, an African American women goes into the same library and gets a book on why women are better than men. Then they see each other, and the woman wants the man's book banned, and the man wants the woman's book banned, and both the books are removed. Then neither party is happy because both of their books are gone. The point is, anything can be found offensive, if you just glance at it, or look at it too much. Plus, if everything can be found offensive, and all of the offensive materials get removed, then all the books and learning materials are gone. No one is left happy. If you are being tried for murdering someone, and the lawyer of the defendant gets to say their piece to make it look like you are a murderer, and you don't get to defend yourself, what are you going to do? You're going to go to jail, most likely an innocent person, and you're marked as a murderer the rest of your life, all because your side of the story wasn't heard. That is unjust, unfair, and unconstitutional. If we let this happen to our libraries, half the books will be sentenced to 'death,' without a 'fair trial.' So, if you want to have an un-American, communist, and unfair library system, that is your choice, but I believe that the way we do things now is just fine. No book should be banned because of its material, because no one, except the writer knows exactly what it means. People get to read what they want to read, and don't have to read what they don't want to read. That's what the freedom we have is, you have a right to read, watch, and listen to whatever you want, and nobody can stop you, and this freedom is essential to a well-informed and just society. Do you want that to change? I know your answer; it's a no.
850	3827	2	3	A library is a place to rent books, music, movies, etc., that you don't have at your home. Some people go to a library to use the computer for a project, or to check out books, musical materials, movies, etc. Censorship isn't a bad thing if the library has materials that are offensive to some people. If people don't want to see material that will offend them then they shouldn't go to the area in the library that contains the offensive materials. In my own personal opinion, censorship doesn't really apply to me if there is offensive material in the library. If there is going to be offensive material in a library then you should be a certain age to rent it or read it. Not just anyone should be able to walk into the library and check out these offensive materials. If someone that is under this age tries to check out this material, then they shouldn't be allowed to have them. Another opinion of mine on this subject, is if these kinds of material offend someone then they could not go to that area of the library. Instead the person can go around this section of the library or they could not pay attention to the materials. The library could make a certain part of the library made just for these kinds of material, so that people nor children have to see them. Also, if a child wants to see these kinds of materials then they could find another way to see them. They don't necessarily have to go to the library to find these kinds of things. If a child wants to do something badly enough then they will find a way to do it, or in this case the child will see something that they want to see. If parents don't like these kinds of materials in the library then they should teach their children not to look at these kinds of materials, if they catch their children looking at materials that are offensive then they should punish their child and let them know that they shouldn't look at those kinds of materials. A library shouldn't have to take off their books, music, magazines, etc., just to satisfy parents. If the library took these kinds of materials off of their shelves then they would lose business. So in theory, libraries should not have to take their materials off of their shelves just to satisfy parents. Libraries need money so that they can buy new materials and without customers they have no money which enables them unable to buy new materials. So parents should keep track of what their kids check out at the library. Offensive materials should not be taken out of libraries, these kind of materials should just have rules, ensuring both access and appropriate guidance.
851	3828	2	3	To begin with, a woman might read a book about wives and find it offensive. But it was her choice to pick up the book and read it. Should it be taken off the shelf? No, why should it. Different people have different perspectives on what they're reading. Not all people feel the same way. The same thing goes for music, movies, magazines, etc. They might see a naked picture of someone in a magazine and not like it. It was their choice to pick it up and read it. No one held a gun to their head and said 'read the book etc.' @CAPS1, why should a book, etc., be taken off the shelf if one person doesn't like it? You still have the rest of the population who might love it, some might just like it, and the ones who don't. You can't just think about that one person; you have to consider everybody else. If that person finds that book, etc., offensive, then they should have chosen wisely the first time and/or never should have chose what they did. It's their own fault. For my conclusion, nothing should be taken off the shelf if it's offensive; just don't read the book, etc. Another person might read it and like it. Some people who find things offensive are maybe looking at it in the wrong way. Keep the book, etc., on the shelf; if they take it off, then sooner or later they will take everything off the shelf for being offensive, and then what will we be able to read or listen to? It is important to consider the diverse viewpoints of others, and banning content based on one person's offense would ultimately limit everyone's access to different ideas and perspectives.
852	3829	2	3	There is much censorship that occurs in the world. Music on the radio, television shows, or the internet is all censored. In todays society the library is a forgotten wonder to most, making it a secluded world. The library is a place were one's mind can explore and discover as much as it wants. The library should not be a place of restricted discovery, like on the televsion or the internet, censorship in libraries should be non-existant. People learn from books; books with happy endings, and sad endings, and gruesome endings, are all able to provide lessons for the reader. Many say that history repeats itself. Therefore history is taught in schools so that the bad events that occurred in history can be prevented. This is the same for the books that are on library shelves. When reading a book, the reader is able to experience the lifes of the characters as if they are living with the characters. Through the experiences of the characters, the reader gets to observe all the things done wrong and right by that character without acually living the experience. By the end of the book the reader will have knew views on life, and will try to not make the same mistakes as the characters in the book. A major fear among the parents is the inappropriate language or scenes that might be described in books. To be blatantly honest, there is foul language and inappopriate doings in this world. It is much better to have it discovered gradually through reading and maybe a couple of life experiences, then to have it all thrown in ones face at one moment. The censoring that occurs on the radio and television is fine, just when someone wants to improve themselves by reading, they should be able to read whatever they feel. A library is a place of wonderous learning, but if there is censorship, it restricts ones learning. Through reading one is able to experience life without the consequences of experienceing life. All books are able to be learned from, and they should all have the opportunity to be learned from, because limiting access limits understanding.
853	3830	2	3	"Have you ever felt as though your reading choices are dwindling? Censorship is taking away our freedom to experience, to read or listen to what we want; who has the right to tell us what we can watch, read or even listen to? As an avid reader of all kinds of literature I can't stand censorship. Kids today need to be able to read what they want, to open up their minds to new ideas and ways of life. The so-called 'banned' books are some of the best anyone can read; as **readers,** we should be able to read what we want, whether it is offensive or not.  If you want to put certain restrictions on a book, such as an age limit, I can understand that, but to completely take them off the shelves then we are losing our greatest right as a **free** citizen. To read and watch or listen to other media is a great way to learn about things other than what is in our back yard.  Music and television I understand some censorship; I don't want my little brother or any younger youth hearing the ""F bomb"" or seeing anything obscene, but these days it's getting harder and harder to control what they watch or listen to, seeing how it's so easy to obtain those sources of media.  Many kids today have access to the internet, which can be good and bad. If a parent does not want their kids watching or listening to anything obscene, then they have the right to put certain blocks on their computer. Kids these days mainly use two kinds of media which are the internet and **video games,** but a kid who wants to read should have as many choices as possible, whether it be fiction, classics such as 'The **Odyssey** and The **Iliad**', or educational literature.  So, is our reading choices becoming scarce? Yes, I believe so, and it all has to do with censorship. We can't read some of the classics because they're 'racist' or are 'pornographic', but you have to understand for the time they were written they weren't, so let everyone read what they want when they want, allowing them to explore diverse perspectives and form their own informed opinions."
854	3831	2	3	No, I do not believe just because someone individually finds something offensive means everyone else does. Everyone has a different opinion, we're all different. We need variety of all books, music, movies, magazines, etc.. Censorship is understandable, in some ways, but can easily become a slippery slope. Without a variety for all would leave everyone less choice, limiting personal growth and understanding. Your opinions, decisions, outlook on life yourself is one of a kind, shaped by your experiences and perspectives. How are you to tell someone they can't listen to a certain song or read a specific book? Exactly, that doesn't make sense right? If individuals didn't have options of choices there would be no entertainment, no exploration of different ideas. In my opinion; if someone has such a problem with a certain topic, subject, etc. then leave it alone. It's a big world with more than just you with your opinion. Be open minded! Someone else is probably writing this essay with the total opposite response to this prompt, demonstrating the spectrum of viewpoints. It just goes to show no ones opinion is right or wrong. Individuals should all have individuality. Without variety, how is that possible? From music, books, magazines, movies, etc.- disagreements are one thing but in questions like this you have to agree to disagree, recognizing the value of diverse perspectives and the importance of allowing individuals to make their own choices without imposing personal preferences on others.
855	3832	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work i abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson said this about the topic of book censorship in the library. This is a very tricky subject because no one will ever be happy. All books, music, movies, magazines, etc. can be considered offensive to someone. When it comes to books in the library we should have sections. One for adult, child, family, activity, romance, etc. if we have those then it would cut down on what books children can look at. One time I went to one library and another library and I accidently wondered into the adult books section. I knew that I was not supposed to go into that section, but if they had it marked that it was the adult Books section then I would not have gone in there. Parents need to monitor what their kids look at, or even what part of the library they go into. If a child wonders into the romance section then they are going to see that kind of book it is not the library's fault or even the fault of the writer. If the parent does not want to monitor what the child looks at they could set boundaries. They could say 'Do not leave this section.'. If my mom said that to me i would stay around the child books. The parents could monitor the child to solve the problem. Library's need to decide what kind of books they are going to have in the library. If the library does not have the kind of books you do not want your child to see then your child can not look at that book. If your public library does keep those books in the open the parents could always go to a town hall and tell the mayor, librarian, or other towns people about the rude books. If you tell people the library has that kind of books then others will stand up against the books. If you do not like what the library has on the shelfs, suggest sections for the books, keep watch of what your kids look at, or tell someone that can do something about the problem. What are you going to do to improve you public library? how are you going to make you kids not go and look at the books you dont want them to see? Ultimately, engaging in these actions can lead to a more tailored and comfortable library experience for both parents and children.
856	3833	2	3	Censorship in libraries should not be mandated. Censorship should not block the 'allegory' in some books that the author is trying to give a story within a story to the reader. Censorship would lead to totalitarianism just like in 1984. You could not get the true meaning of an art piece that the artist is trying to show, so there could be no possible abstract art. The word definition of allegory is a story within a story. It is where the author is trying to show to the reader. For example like in the book 'LORD of the FLIES' is an allegory. It shows many storys tying in with each other. When Simon dies on the side of the cliff by Roger when he launches the huge rock over board. That shows the fall of man. In the GARDEN where Eve eats the apple from the tree and that is why we sin. You just cannot censor such a great book. Very many people would not like that book because it shows young boys being savages and killing each other. Everyone needs to look at both sides of the story. People need to know the true meaning of what is being said. Art should not be censored at all. Art is what makes people creative. The way artists make things abstract that could kindle some controversy. Also they make things that we use today that we just don't think about, that are utilitarion. Who would give you the right to censor thier master pieces. For example Picasso had a dark period in his work and painted demon's in his paintings and people might think that is way too graffic. People need to see why he painted such works of what was going on during his life at that time. Censorship is totalitarianism totalitarianism. This would to a book called '1984' by Orwell. In his book he show complete govnerment totalitarianism. We as the people of our goverment would be classified as the 'PROLES'. The PROLES made the majority of the people and were not very smart people. Also could not think for themselves because the totalitarianism censored everything you could think of. The totalitarianism did this because so they would not have anyone try to be a rebel and over throw the totalitarianism. They knew that PROLES could over throw them, but they were on top of their game and censored everying. This is what would happen if we censored everything. We all would have not personality at all. No one could express love the way we do now. Censorship would in libraries would not be the most best thing anyone should do. No one would know what an author would be leading too, not a single artist could display their art. Aslo censorship would lead to totalitarianism totalitarianism. This could not work in our society today. So censorship is not the best idea anyone could think of, as it stifles creativity and understanding.

I wouldn't want my younger kids reading or watching anything they couldn't say to my face. There's so much that little kids can see, like magazines with ladies in bras and underwear at any store or anywhere. It's not right to display them where it's easy for little ones to see. Such things lead to kids asking questions that force parents to lie. Then there are kids watching TV and seeing cartoons where the characters are cursing and talking about sex. When you're not around, your child might watch those channels and hear this stuff. They'll then tell their friends, thinking it's cool, and soon many kids are hearing it, but you can simply remove those channels from your TV to make things easier. The worst is when people sing about killing and raping. I'd never let my kids listen to music like that, regardless of their age. That's where kids pick up most of the bad stuff; the music they listen to is horrible. I'd do anything to prevent kids from listening to that until their parents approve. My parents didn't like the music I listened to when I was young, and now that I'm older, I understand why, so I'll never let my kids listen to it at a young age. I hope I've made a good point and that you agree. Why let our kids listen to things that hurt them and us in the long run, it's just not worth the trouble of letting them do whatever they want; shielding them from harmful content is a responsible way to guide them.
858	3835	2	3	I believe that everyone should be free to read, listen, or watch what they choose to. Anything publicly exposed is going to be seen anyhow. I think it should be up to that person if they want to read something to mature or educate themselves. If it is a child, I think the parent should be in charge of that decision, not the librarian. Books, movies, and music are forms of entertainment. People read any material to entertain themselves, and there is nothing wrong with entertainment. Everyone loves entertainment, but to put a limit on it is unfair. If it is public, that means it should be released under certain circumstances or age and maturity. Regardless, in a book or magazine, everything that you don't want people to see will always show up somewhere else, such as the TV or the internet. The public library is where people go to get books to learn more about something, so if you take that book off the shelf, someone might miss out on an education about something. I wouldn't take any book off the shelf because it was put there to read, and it might be a good thing that child gets that book so that they have knowledge about things that are out there. If it's there to read, then let it be read; instead of hiding it from them, it only makes children more anxious to read or see it. If it's in a public library, let it be read; people and children shall be free to anything in the library unless otherwise consented by a parent. Anything publicly exposed in a book, magazine, or movie will be shown on the internet or TV, so children will see what they want, whether elders agree to it or not. Nudity, profanity, violence, and provocative material are in everything nowadays, even cartoons, so there is no way of keeping it from children or people; it's a part of everyday living. Therefore, restricting access to books in libraries is ultimately futile and potentially harmful, as exposure to diverse content, even controversial material, is an unavoidable aspect of modern life.
859	3836	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 many people believe that certain books should be banned from schools, just the opposite is true as students can learn valuable life lessons from these books, get a deeper understanding of the past, and comprehend the true meaning of an author's unique style. Over the years many well-written books have been on a 'censored list', meaning that they are at a risk of being removed from the library. 'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1', '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2', and '@CAPS3 to @ORGANIZATION3' are all examples of books that have been marked down as being offensive. These books are all written in a style of their own and can bring a different lesson to every reader. While one reader @MONTH1 love the story and wear out the pages, another @MONTH1 get halfway through and never finish it. However, the belief that there is freedom of choice in reading is correct. 'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON1 is a classic example of a censored book. Throughout the book there is foul language used that is considered offensive to some. However, at the period of time the book was written, these words were not considered to be wrong. Books like this should be saved for older generations to read; however, we also have to realize that if a parent allows their children to read that book at a young age, there is nothing that can be done about it. None-the-less, removing the book from the library is not the correct response. Ever heard the saying 'learn from past mistakes'? Books are a fantastic way to learn about the past in a fun and enjoyable way. They are a tool of knowledge. Removing a book from a library is like removing hundreds of pages of knowledge. Every story has a unique style, which @MONTH1 appeal to some and not to others. Many books give readers a deeper understanding of what the time period was like when the book was written. '@ORGANIZATION2' has been a known censored book from the beginning due to its somewhat dark and gloomy aspects at certain points throughout the story. How many kids do we see at school carrying around one of the '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2' books? They often state that it is their favorite book of all time. If the book were to be removed from the library, it would cause many students to never have the opportunity to read a fantastically written book, which has a unique style about it. Throughout our twelve years of school, students are taught to think for themselves and make their own decisions. How are we encouraging this if we are removing materials from their grasp? If we cannot let students make such a simple decision as to whether or not to read a book, we are teaching poor life lessons. Banning books ultimately limits the potential for students to engage with diverse perspectives and develop their own critical thinking skills, thus hindering their educational growth and ability to navigate a complex world.
860	3837	2	3	I feel that there should not be censorship in libraries. All offensive material, as much as the more conservative patrons may not like it, should stay where they belong, which is in the library for all to read. I have several reasons that support my opinion about not removing material found offensive by some. My biggest reason is the learning capabilities these articles offer. Most works, even the more crude pieces, have some sort of educational value. Without articles based on the less comfortable or more gruesome items of life, people start to only understand in a surreal sort of way, not understanding how the less fortunate things function or how to avoid them. Those who pursue a true wanting to gain knowledge will look at many different kinds of informational items, no matter the subject. Allowing this to occur is allowing the library to be used as it was meant to be used for, a resource for knowledge. All offensive items a library may have stored should stay in that very spot, for learning purposes. No one should be denied the ability to learn just because of the shielding nature of others; therefore, libraries should not censor offensive material.
861	3838	2	3	All of us can think of or have this one book that we read and hope none of our children or any other children have taken it off a shelf. Well at least I know I have a book like that, its called '@CAPS1'. I, myself personally feel that this book should be removed from the selves because for the simple fact it is over-rated and contains lots of violence and sex. A while back when I was in the seventh grade, I read this book called,'@CAPS1'. I thought it was an alright book, but I also felt like it was very explesive. The book was mainly about this teen who had a rough childhood and was trying to make it through high school while being engaged in a abusive relationship, peer pressure, and a adiction to sex and drug. This book was exposing and very detailed, In which I strongly disagree with other children reading this book. I feel sex and violence shouldn't displayed in books or any other type of media. Inconclusion, I believe that certain materials such as books should be removed from the selves if they are found offensive. Books that display lots of sex and violence should be restricted and not able to leave the selves of libary unless their issued to someone eighteen or older, ensuring that younger readers are shielded from potentially harmful content.
862	3839	2	3	I am writing to the newspaper, about removing certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and more. I dont think this should be allowed. I dont think it would be far to others. My first reason is that, what if you had a child and wanted he or she to see the same movie or book you did when you were little? But they took it off the shelves. That would be sad and you would want them to see the movie or book you did but they cant. Like what Katherine Paterson said 'All of us think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' My second reason is, what if you and a wife or husband had a favorite song, but they took it off the shelves? That would be devastating, it would just break your heart. Well I know it would me if it was are wedding song. The last and favorite reason is, you just have your own opinion. Everyone has their own opinion, if you dont want to see them or look at them just dont do it. It's as easy as that, just try to ignore it. It's really not your problem to worry about. These reasons are why you should not let people remove anything off of any shelves. Like what Katherine Paterson said 'But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we let this happen everyone will take advantage of it. That is why I am saying no to letting people remove anything off of any shelves. Removing materials restricts access and infringes upon individual choices, ultimately diminishing the richness and diversity of available resources for everyone.
863	3840	2	3	Should we censor books in libraries? Katherine Paterson, an author, once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This provides a very valid point. If we start taking off books that we find offensive, there will be none left. Books are meant to provide information and insight into someone's life. If we take away that book, it would be like saying that person's idea did not matter. The main reasons why we should not show censorship in libraries are a loss of insight, books, and personal creativity. Books provide insight into the author's life. Also the things that are happening in history affect the author's tone or style, like Shakespeare. During his lifetime, William Shakespeare was ruled by kings, so if he wanted to be successful, he had to appease the monarchy. It also helped appeasing the monarchy since he was sponsoring Shakespeare's plays. Another example of an author influenced by his time and upbringing would be Geoffrey Chaucer. He was alive during the middle ages, and he constantly saw oppressive things like serfs. When he wrote his tales, he made the high class people sort of mean while he made the lower caste people on the humbler side. Chaucer was not afraid to displease the government. If we start taking off books from shelves in a library that we think are offensive then soon there would not be any as Katherine Paterson said. Where one might find information, another might find it highly offensive and vice versa. Every book would have someone say it was offensive. It might be the context or the tone or even the person who wrote it; it does not matter. Sometimes the books that are the most informative are the ones that are offensive. However sometimes it is good to have offensive things in books. It builds the tone and mood of the story or character. It might create a certain image. It also teaches us not to what these people are doing. The books sometimes show us a depressing ending of a person who lived a vulgar or criminal life. These stories teaches us life lessons. Yes sometimes I read a book that I find offensive, but I have learned that if I do not like does not mean someone else does not. It would not be fair then to take off a book that someone might have learned something from just because you do not like it. I am sorry, the world does not revolve solely around you and me. It revolves us as a whole, and if someones starts taking off books, who is to stop someone else from doing the same. It would not be fair. Finally, if we started taking off books, it would start influencing kids in thinking it was okay to throw away someone's creativity. It also make them think that there ideas would not matter and no one would be able to appreciate them. I for one do not like doing things, if they might offend someone. I could not imagine what it would be like in that type of society. Books are important to have. They teach us about events or people who were before our time or problems some people experience. It is important to be aware of what is going on around you. I grew up ignorant of big problems that were occuring in society. My parents tried to shield me from the bad news and creeps in society. Reading books is what opened my eyes to what life is really like. So taking off books from shelves would have hindered the process of me growing up. I would still be that ignorant little child thinking that life ends in a happily ever after. Unfortunatley most do not, but there are some that have a happy life. That is what books are for, to teach people about other people's experiences, the good and the bad. So Katherine Paterson was wise in her observation, and we must remember that restricting access to literature ultimately limits our understanding and growth as individuals and as a society. Who is to stop someone from taking off books once this processes has started?
864	3841	2	3	Books, movies, and music should not be removed from the shelves. For many years, people have come to the library for them. Some might be vulgar, as well as offensive, but there should be an age check out law, as well as being within consideration for this century's ways. There are many people who thrive off of the horrible things people put out into the world. They love the pain of others. Instead of taking the offensive work off the shelves, there should be an age limit to what certain age groups should read. Yes, there are young kids who are reading this kind of things, but that lies with the parents. If there was an age limit of what people should be able to read, then that would solve the problem. As well, we could have the parents sign out the book saying it is okay for their child to read such a book. If we had all of this, then there would not be any more problems. It would be a nice, controlled library. So, in conclusion, this is the way to go; this is the future of tomorrow. Implementing these measures would ensure access while promoting responsible consumption of media.
865	3842	2	3	Lets think in todays known world the childern and teens have access to pretty much everything. If you ask a teenager this same question should this stuff be tooken off the shelves. They might say no. If ask an adult how ever they are most likely going to say yes. The music that surrond young adults and childern isn't the best. Go ahead and listen you will be amazed. If they have access to it then they are going to take it and borrow it. I feel that most of the music and movies on shelves anywhere should be taken off. Now thats just my opinion. Even adults listen to this stuff and watch all of this stuff. I say that the reason why people are failing school is because of all this stuff. You think about it they have so many rights that they shouldn't have.  If there is anything offensive then it should be tooken off the shelves. They should be replaced with educational things. Lets go back to where it all began back when everytbing started to come out. Did you have most of this stuff growing up? You probably didn't. But now you can find anything almost anywhere. Which is kind of sad if you ask me. Magazines however are starting to bcome more like movies and music. Mainly with all the nudity and foul words that they show.  If you look at atheltes it doesn't matter who it is they get in trouble for things they shouldn't of said. they should be out teaching kids not to say this stuff. That right there will help out educatiion and what not. You can become a more responible adult by showing them whats right and whats wrong. Starting with what they listen to or what they watch. I'm not allowed to watch current things and yet I do anyway. Thats because my parents aren't giving me enough discipline and they didn't when I was little.  If you let a child grow up to listen and watch what they want the odds they might not do good in school. One way you can help out is by hanging out with the chiold or childern. Even teens. Even though the don't want you too. Talk to them make conversatuions teach them right from wrong, you teach a child right from wrong the outlook on school will be better, and ultimately, by guiding their choices and instilling values, we can hope to shape a more responsible and educated future generation.
866	3843	2	3	When you are taking your little kid to the library because they want a book you think 'hmmm, there isn't anything bad at the library its all education books.' Of course, @CAPS1 you would feel if your child wanted to check out a movie there? You would be ok with it because no one thinks there are bad images or movies at the library. A little girl could be with her mom at the library in the adult section and they could see some things you would not want them to see. The romance books usually have girls on there half clothed and the guys in basically nothing. A child could easily see that and not know what it meant but they would have that image in their head for a very long time. Some of the kids could go up to the movies section and pull out a scary movie that shows blood and guns.  It's not just the kids seeing the stuff its everyone. A teen could easily get a book and not be paying attention and see stuff about the other gender. A couple could go in the library trying to find a good healthy funny movie, but could find a movie that would make them uncomfortable. An older person could try to find some music from back in their time but when they get it, all of it is about drugs, sex, or even alcohol.  The magazines always have girls half clothed, even in seventeen magazine. The car magazines of girls modeling in front of the cars to make them look better or irresistible. You can get a baby magazine and it shows a mom breast feeding. You could have just wanted to look at it because of the babies you or your child do not want to see a mom breast feeding.  The library is a very resourceful place and you can get very good information about things there. They have some bad parts about them too. I think the music that talks about personal things and bad things should be in its own little place. Same with the magazines, movies and books they should all be in a room together away from all the rest of the items in the library. They should have an age limit you have to be to be able to go in that room. They should tell you what type of stuff is in there before you go in.  I'm not saying the library is a bad place for kids or teens or anyone, but these potentially inappropriate materials need a separate, designated space. I just think that certain books, music, and magazines should be kept in a different place instead of out in the open where everyone can see them, ensuring a more controlled and age-appropriate environment for all library patrons.
867	3844	2	3	Libraries are stocked filled with all kind of reading materials, such as books, magazines, and catalogs, but are all of these appropriate for the crowd that dwindle around a library? My answer is no, but should they be taken away from the libraries, no. Although many kids go through libraries so do many adults trying to find good pieces of literature; that is why they should keep these books available to most. When I was in the seventh grade I recall reading a book, by the title of *Go Ask Alice*, about a child who had gotten sexually abused, I wish I had never picked up that book. Although it made me very frightened, it taught me a very good lesson. I learned at a young age to never associate with strangers, and if it wasn't for this novel it could have been very different. Therefore I believe it is good to get children at a young age small dosages of the real life, not everything in the world is sugar coated like some people would argue. From *Atlas Shrugged* to the bible, there is a vast variety of literature. This variety provides stories for many audiences. The libraries try to do there best by categorizing these books so that smaller children do not get there hands on the wrong books. Instead of taking the books totally out of the repertoire, another suggestion that could be made is to have a system like they do for mature rated video games and only allow people over the age of 17 to check certain books out. This making it near impossible for children to get there hands on the wrong books. Lastly, a suggestion that could be made is to label inappropriate books such as adult comics, DVDs and movies. This could make a small difference and make children think twice before opening up a book labelled for mature audiences only. This providing stories for all, and protecting small children from magazines such as *Playboy*. Like Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf... then you also have the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I perceive what she is trying to say is similar to what I am. She wants all the books to be provided and kids just to be shied away from these, and hope that children can make the right decision when choosing a piece of literature from a library, which ultimately ensures intellectual freedom and access to diverse perspectives for everyone.
868	3845	2	3	I think that if it is a problem for others and not all, why can't we just separate things into sections? That way, there would be fewer problems. I mean, why change something if only a few people don't like something? That's only going to lead to a big conflict. Think about if we were to try and give everyone what they want; that would not work out well at all. So, you should just limit things down and put them in sections, allowing different groups to have their preferred environments and minimizing friction, which would lead to a more harmonious outcome overall.
869	3846	2	3	Censorship, a very sensitive topic. There are so many things people dislike, so they censor it, hiding the idea's from the people who don't know about it. I personally detest censorship. I would rather the world be an educated place with minor dangers, then a place where everything is kept secret and safe. You must be thinking, 'There are some things we have to censor, it can harm our childrens minds.' But in truth, your children will find out about it in the real world eventually anyway. In reality, drugs, alchohol, sex, rape, violence, and all the other things you censor are common things that your kids will hear about. Most children first hear about it in school, normally elementary, and if not they will definately find out in junior high. If they will eventually find out anyway, wouldn't it be better to let them find out the easy way? Now you must be thinking, 'But if they find out too young, it could tramatize them.' That is a risk, but most teenagers are more tramatized anyway when exposed to it without any prior knowledge. If they already know what their dealing with they would know how to react, but if they have no knowledge of whats going on they could make a major mistake without even realizing it. Once again, wouldn't it be better they find out from you or a book, then find out the hard way? Now, you may be thinking, 'Our children must be protected, this knowledge could just put them in more danger.' It may put them in more danger, it's always a possibility. The world is full of possibilities though, anything could happen. This knowledge that you always hide from them may be what they need to know later on, and wont know when they need it. What would they do if they see their friends start doing drugs, and since they have never heard of drugs, they don't know it's a bad thing to do? Or if they see older kids drinking, and are offered a drink, but dont know they shouldn't take it? Or if they wind up kissing someone they like, and it goes too far, but they don't know what their doing? Anything could happen, and your children need to be prepared. If they don't know of these things, they can't tell if what their doing is good or bad, and they may wind up getting in trouble or hurt. Tell them, or let them read the books you always censor at the libraries so that they know. Life is full of risks, so let them know, that way when the time comes their ready.
870	3847	2	3	As I walked through @ORGANIZATION1 libraries and @CAPS1 bookstores as a young girl I saw a @CAPS2 magazine book, seeing this and being a girl that likes reading that magazine I opened it. I soon found out it was a book that I would never actually read. I found myself embarrassed and wondering why they wouldn't make it clearer that it should be censored. I think that censorship in libraries and bookstores is a good thing. Yes, kids need to learn about relationships and intimacy, but that is their parents' jobs. A @NUM1 10 year old girl should not be able to see an inappropriate movie, magazine or book whenever she wants because we need to teach them ourselves. Censoring magazines gives children a chance to find who they are, not what the world wants them to be. Censoring the book helps by keeping small children 'sheltered'; they don't have to know everything by age ten. It gives them time to grow up themselves. The movies that are made give a false outlook on what sex and intimacy really is. You flip through magazines and see child stars everywhere feeling the pressure to grow up. They think they have to dress like an adult and act like one too. Children see this and think that if @PERSON1 Miley Cyrus acts like that so should I. The magazine industry really hurts children in the long run. They put the super skinny model in a barely there bikini. Sports @CAPS3 Illustrated prides itself on that. Maxim has the '@CAPS4 Girls Next Door' @NUM2 20 somethings a bunch of @CAPS8 women laying around in clothes that barely cover them. The boys all think that it's @CAPS4 cool and that that's what every girl is supposed to look like. They get the @CAPS5 Playboy magazines and drool over how the centerfold looks. Letting small children see this makes them think that they have to dress and act a certain way. It makes them think if you dress like this when you get older you can get all the boys too. Today there are so many books on how to keep your man happy, how to spice up the bedroom, @NUM3 50 things to try in bed tonight that a child could just walk and see. Many of these books have images of how to do this and that, that it could really make a child and his or her parent(s) feel very uncomfortable. When you go to @ORGANIZATION1 libraries and @CAPS1 bookstores or any bookstore they have a relationship, love section that are all these kinds of books. Many young people @MONTH1 January think love, oh I bet that's @CAPS7 Twilight or a @PERSON1 Bella and @PERSON2 Edwards book. They see the cover that intrigues them. They think oh this girl is pretty. Censoring these books can give an ease to kids and parents. The kids can just grow up the way that they should. Now movies give a very large false pretense on what sexual intercourse really is. They see the people do all these things and they think that it's normal and you don't have to worry about a thing, but kids here's the kicker sex is not just sex. When you have sex you have to make sure you are safe. This isn't just fun and games. In @LOCATION1 America today many young @CAPS8 women get raped. Does it show that on the movie? No, it doesn't. Many young @CAPS8 women as little as five go around thinking about how awful it was to be raped, but yet we set back and let pornography be made. Pornography is false, @CAPS8 women don't just look at each other and get turned on. Sex is never going to just be sex, and by censoring the movies kids don't get that idea before they really learn and have the knowledge of what sex really means and is. Censoring is something that I strongly believe in. To this day my parents still make sure the movies we pick are appropriate. Parents and children can learn about sex whenever they want, but some parents choose to wait. By putting those movies and those books in a separate area it gives parents the chance to teach their kids, and the kids time to grow, which ultimately supports a healthier understanding of relationships and sexuality when they are ready.
871	3848	2	3	Katherine Paterson wrote, ''If I had the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.'' quote. Having the right to do something is a part of freedom of speech almost. Its believing in your decision or choice you have made. If I were to reflect my views on censorship in libraries, we all would have that same opportunity to state our opinion about what we feel should not be included. There could be inappropriate books in the library that we absolutely would not want our younger siblings reading. The best thing is to ask ourselves, Should we have the right to take our kids freedom and right to read, listen to, updated media and publications from them when we had it? Should we put censorship on the libraries really? I feel that censoring a library would not be necessary considering a library is a manual guide of history. Our libraries are organized from A to Z in authors names, separated from non-fiction and fiction, CD's separated in one section, movies one section, magazines, and adult books from children book separated in different sections. Libraries all across the world has had a kid that might have choose a book that was not appropriate for them to read but what kid hasn't. What would a book hurt them if there's plenty of bad influences, peer pressure, violence, and sexually publicity everywhere and 90% in the media. It would not be fair at all for us to rob our kids of the chance to read and learn from books. I feel no we should not take our learning form our babies. Growing up as a kid I loved being able to go to the library it helped to enhance my vocabulary, spelling and which I learned plenty new words. Books I read growing up wasn't perfectly PG but I could relate to a lot of books I choose as a kid so no I feel we should not censor libraries we need them to be a fun place to our children and us to go to for learning, fun, comfort and etc. We can't take that from our generation it just would not be right, and we should trust in their ability to choose what is right for them.
872	3849	2	3	Having offensive books and movies in a library shouldn't be allowed. If you were in a library and you saw a book or anything that you took offensive, more than likely someone else will find it offensive too. So, by eliminating the problem before anyone else sees it, will reduce problems before they even happen. Now, more then ever, you will find offensive things in libraries. More people get offended by lesser things now.  One reason to have censorship in libraries is that, if you had a child, would you want them going to the library and seeing derogatory writings and movies? I would be very upset if my child had to see that. It's teaching them different values and it's teaching them that since it's in a library it must be okay to do out in the community. For example, if the library has a book or movie about doing drugs or anything sexual, they're going to look up to that and more then likely do those things, which they could end up harming themselves or others. It could also normalize harmful behaviors.  If the government provides the taxes for the libraries, doesn't it show that our government doesn't care about the offensive items on the shelves? It gives them a bad name. If we look to our government for support and answers, how would we feel if they had no judgement about the offensive things in libraries? It would seem like they didn't care and that might cause panic throughout the country, which would cause many more problems then needed. It would be a easier thing just to censor our libraries. The public might feel the government is endorsing these views.  If our libraries weren't consumed with negative and offensive literature, we would have a lot more room for things of greater value. We could have books and movies that are educational and will actually teach a person something, rather than lead them into making bad decisions. There are plenty of other sites and places you could get a book if you really wanted it. Not just the library has books. You could find one quite easily if you tried. If a library does have offensive things, I think they wouldn't have a large variety, so it would be a better decision just to look for it elsewhere, where you could find a larger quantity of the subject you are looking for.  When I go to the library, I go there for educational books, not books that teach kids how to 'fill a bong' or 'different sex positions.' I highly disagree and I think it's a negative outlook on our society by putting those things in our future generation's hands to read. So by putting censorship in our libraries, not only will calm down some of the problems that are re-occurring in our communities, it just might eliminate the problem completely, leading to a more positive and constructive environment for everyone.
873	3850	2	3	There are a lot of different things that can be offensive to all sorts of people. So, if we started taking things off TV or out of books and magazines, we would be always taking stuff out. If it's too graphic for kids, put it in the adults' area. Would censorship be the answer to take stuff out? No. We need to be more aware of where our children are, and there would be fewer problems. If we made the age limits on movies stricter, we might be even better off. If parents were to watch the movie, then the parent would be able to tell them what's okay and what's not. We need to put more true history stuff in them and make them where you want to watch them; we could be teaching kids more stuff so they know. The music should be censored somewhat, like with rap. There is a lot of rap music that should be cleaned up so little kids don't hear it. There might even be a better way to control this stuff so little kids can't get a hold of it. We can have teachers help tell the kids and let them know that it's not right for them to watch that. We also need to look at some of the new cartoons that are on TV; some need to be cleaned up. There are also a lot of differences in what people want. Then there are some that don't care about it too. Hopefully, someday we will figure it out and be able to do it, finding a balance that respects individual choice while protecting children.
874	3851	2	3	A lot of people believe that books are useless and should not even be on a shelf. Well I believe that no book is useless nor should it be removed from shelves from any library. All books are worth something toward anything like careers, and being able to learn new things. Magazines might not be any help towards alot of things like books are, but they are something to entertain you. Music is not just something you listen to, but its something to help keep you nice and relaxed while you are reading a book. Movies can have a certain impact on someone; alot of people think movies are just entertainment for them to watch, but it could have some encouragement, or it can really show how a person acts if you really pay attention and look into what the movie is saying. No book, magazine, music, or movies should be taken off shelves because they are not there for you to read or listen to or watch, but those things are all there to tell people something about things people do not even know. People should take a second look at how all of these things can really affect a persons life. More books, magazines, music, and movies should be put in the libraries of school, or even the public libraries. The more people read, watch, or listen to these things the better they understand life. I have noticed from experience that people just go to the library and read a book just to relax, but yet at the same time those people really do not understand what they are reading. Its really a shame that people do not look into what they are reading, thats why it would be important for more books to be put on the shelves. Just like Katherine Paterson said: 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf , the work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If people really understood what that quote really means then they would have a better understanding of what books actually mean in life. We should be thankful to have authors like Katherine Paterson in our life because these authors are there to help us understand the meaning of these amazing books in this world, ultimately enriching our understanding of the world and each other.
875	3852	2	3	A library is a public place for all ages. They have many different kinds of books for specific reasons. For the children they have a nice comfy spot for them to pick a book and sit down and read it. For adults they have coffee tables, sofa seats, and many different things while they read their books. Never should a library have to disclose certain materials because of the ages that come in and out; this is about intellectual freedom.  Censoring a library would not make it any easier to keep young children away from certain materials that are offensive. I feel that when a child is in a library they should go to their specific areas for which they came for, they should also be monitored while in the library. Most kids wouldn't go to a book that doesn't have a lot of pictures or colors in it anyway. The library is a public place and is made for all ages, even though there are bookstores that sell just adult books, movies, and magazines, they still shouldn't throw them out of a library. There should be equal rights all over, yes even in libraries, and this includes access to information.  The world is full of offensive things period. Now while a child is not within a library they could be at home or in a public place and see things that they could also see in a book at the library. The removal of certain books, movies, and magazines wouldn't really stop anything. I think that if the parents teach their children right from wrong there is nothing wrong with them being in a library that has adult books, movies, and magazines. If I owned a library I personally would not mind all kinds of books that are appropriate to a certain extent in my selection of books. I have been to plenty of libraries and have seen stuff that I thought shouldn't be in there but at the same I was not in my right section or doing what I was supposed to be doing. This subject really doesn't bother me, so no I don't think they should remove certain books just because children are in the library, as parental guidance and responsibility are key factors in a child's development and exposure.
876	3853	2	3	Censorship. When was the last time someone told you what you could, and couldn't do? Especially if it was something you didn't want to do. How'd that make you feel? You probably didn't want to do it, did you? Censorship is somewhat the same way. The other day, my friends and I wanted to go see a new movie that just came out. We weren't allowed to see it though. You know why? Due to censorship, we weren't old enough to be able to see this movie. So, now the only way we'll be able to see this movie is if our parents go with us. Have you ever had your parents go with you and your friends? Doesn't go so well, does it? Censorship violates freedom of being different. You can't listen to music, watch movies, or even read certain books, unless you're of a certain age. That's not fair. Censorship is like a modern-day dictator. It tells you what you can and can't do, how you can dress, and what to say. Everybody would be the same then. How did Hitler do with his idea? He failed miserably. How do you think the Salem Witch Trial victims felt? They were punished for believing, or doing something different. They weren't hurting anybody; they just wanted to live their lives a different way. That's what censorship is doing, classifying people into certain groups, telling them what they can and can't see, do, or listen to. That's what makes the world different, people that are different. Don't make everyone be the same; celebrate our individuality and resist the urge to control what others experience.
877	3854	2	3	Everyone has different views on works of literature, wheather it be books, magazines, movies, or music. If libraries were to removes this stuff from the shelves then they would be loosing business, they would be loosing children, and they would taking away the reason of it being on the shelves. These libraries would be loosing business to the people who maybe like the kind of stuff that they do not. The people running the business might decide to take out older pieces of work that might offend younger people in this generation. The stuff wrote, sang, or played in these things might harm these people but that is not what it is in there for. The things that harm people are in there to show people in the younger generations how life was lived in the older days, as in the slaves. This would play a roll on children that use this library also. If this literature was taken out, children might think that things have always been the way they are as they see it. If these children grew up and were to see a book, hear a song, or watch a movie about how things were in the olden days, and how much it has changed, then they might never believe it because they were not taught as children. As they are older, they might still never have the interest to learn about these types of things because they never knew about them growing up. These things are wrote to teach people and children about how things used to be, they are not used to harm people. When people take these things harmful, they are not getting the true meaning that the author had in mind when the wrote them. Libraries should keep these peices of literature on their shelves, only to teach young people of what the world has came from and how their older relatives lived, and what they came from, because removing such materials would deprive future generations of valuable historical context and understanding.
878	3855	2	3	I feel that there should be censorship in libraries. Children shouldn't be able to go to the library and see certain books if they aren't supposed to; this could save people from getting in trouble and reading the wrong stuff. There should be censorship in libraries because they already have stores that contain certain things that kids aren't able to buy, establishing age restrictions elsewhere. One other reason that I feel that there should be censorship is because children will probably read something and take it the wrong way, misinterpreting the content. When you are a kid and you know that there is something that you know for sure you shouldn't be reading or watching, you try your best to sneak and read or watch whatever it might be. That's why if we had censorship, they wouldn't have a chance to do so, preventing access to inappropriate material. Another reason I say we should have censorship is because libraries are public, and if you have to be a certain age to look at or view something, then you shouldn't have it readily available in the library.  As you can see, these are the reasons that I feel we should have censorship in libraries. With censorship, nobody will feel left out, and everyone will be treated equally and feel the same, shielded from potentially harmful content. They already have bookstores and online sites where you can buy books and movies, and they have no censorship; you just have to be a certain age and have a credit card. That way, they are for sure it is okay for you to rent things from them because you have to be a certain age to have a credit card. So, with that being said, I feel there should be censorship in libraries, ensuring responsible access to information for children.
879	3856	2	3	The library is a place for people to go and read whatever they want. Some people just enjoy reading and others go to find information. People are allowed to read and write whatever they want and sometimes it might offend others but there's nothing you can really do about it. Sometimes there might be inapropriate books at the library or the super market but even if it doesnt apply to you it might to someome else, for instance say there's a book or magazine talking about being homosexual and you dont think it should be allowed but someone who is might find it interesting to see how other people deal with it. Another topic most people argue about is books about sex or drugs. Adults who have children don't want them reading about those things and in some ways they might because in a book it might show the reader how there bad for you and that you shouldnt do them. I know I ike reading books like that because it just shows me how it messes peoples lives up and I dont want to live like that. There are some things I dont think should be allowed like books, magizines, music, and movies about racialism. I don't think its right for people to talk about others just because there skin is a different color, they have just as much right to be here as we do. Another thing that bothers me are movies about people that have problems like adhd or down syndrome and other kids bullying them because its not there fault there like that and its just inapropriate. Some people don't realize what they write might hurt others and sometimes they write them for that purpose and even though we may complain about them no good ever comes out of it because everyone has a freedom of speech and we just have to deal with it and go on with our lives. And if there are inapropriate things at the library you dont like or don't want your children to see then don't let them go, because ultimately, it's up to each individual to decide what they consume and expose themselves to.
880	3857	2	3	I think that some material should be removed from the shelves if they are racist or contain unsightly images. But that brings up the question about racism; almost all of the classic books have some form of racism in them such as To Kill a Mockingbird; that book uses the N word to describe African Americans, but when that book was published that was common talk. Now people look at you like you have just murdered their first born child if you were to use that word. For the most part though books are not all that offensive, at least none of the books I read. I know that there are books and magazines such as playboy and maxim that are offensive to women and have probably caused a lot of breakups and divorces, but they have laws on who are able to buy things like that. I know that kids still have a way of owning magazines like that but they are a small percentage of the kids. I know that during World War II over in Germany many books were banned because they had something to do with Catholicism or something that Hitler believed was bad and not what he believed was the perfect race. I know that for a short time alot of what Mark Twain wrote was banned for using the N word but people have to realize that when Mark Twain was alive that was everyday language. As for me being Catholic there is a codex of forbidden books that is a list of books that I am not supposed to read as a good catholic. I have no idea what those books are and what got them on this list but they must be very rude and vulgar to be on this list. I can see how some of those books could be banned. As for music I think that the only music that should be banned is the kind of music that talks about killing police officers and hurting the people that are trying to make our country a safer place. I know that all of this rap genre is what my generation is into even though I dont see why kids like that kind of music. I also think that music produced by the arian brotherhood should not be allowed in libraries because there music is overtly racist. I dont think that movies should be banned from the libraries because of violence or anything of that nature. I do think that the movie should be banned if it contains anything of the nature of pornography but they do not let those kinds of movie in the libraries anyway so they are a step ahead of me. I do have to agree with Katherine Paterson on what she said that if I have those rights then everyone else does to and there will be no books on the shelves because someone will find that offensive then someone else will find something else offensive and soon eventually there will be no books left on the library shelves. My view of what I think is offensive is very relaxed compared to other's; I do not get offended at a lot of things, making me believe that while some censorship might be needed, we must be careful not to go too far and lose access to valuable works.
881	3858	2	3	"The materials in libraries raise questions about censorship and access. Have you ever come across a book that you thought was really good, but knew it might show certain offense to someone you know? My stance on materials that show offense in libraries is they should not be taken off the shelves. People should have their own choice of books, and who has the right to tell someone what they should read? My opinion is that materials that might be offensive to certain individuals should not be taken off the shelf, but put in a certain section that says adult material such as books, music, movies, etc.  I myself have experienced not being able to get a certain movie because of my age. The book was called *The Outsiders*, but it was just full of action/adventure. This was very unfair in my eyes; just because I was young, I couldn't check out a certain movie. This was an experience that I've been through, which lead me to my opinion that materials that might show certain offense to someone should not be removed.  Another reason that the materials should stay on the shelf is because many people like different things. No one is going to have the same interest all the time. So by taking materials away is just helping one person, but hurting many by taking something they might be interested in. I can understand that people have been through things, and might not be happy that offensive materials are around. Then again I think all materials are not the same; they can get the materials they enjoy, and leave the other materials up to other people to choose from.  In conclusion I believe that the materials that show offense to certain people should stay. The reason being is because the material that might show offense to an individual, might just be very interesting to another person. This is a saying I heard before from the Ebony magazine, ""another person's junk might be someone else's treasure,"" which I believe is a good saying for this topic."
882	3859	2	3	I do not feel these types of things should not be taken off the shelves. What I think is that things should come with a rating because this is a free country and for someone to do something like that it would be taking away someone's freedom of speech. Too many people have fought in the past for just simply freedom of speech. I think that if people rate the things that come out then they will not go into the wrong hands. That's like saying they should have taken @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 when they first came out off the market because they have violence in them, profane language, and guns. That company would have lost a lot of money because it is inappropriate for kids. I think that parents shouldn't go buy a @NUM1 or @NUM2 year old something like that, but some parents do. It’s not the creators fault of the actions of how people react to whatever is put out there because the buyers have to be more responsible and make sure that whatever it is is supervised and carefully monitored. There's an old saying 'everything isn't made for everybody'. I strongly believe that; that saying is so true. Everybody don't like the same thing that someone else likes, but it's okay for that person but it's not okay for you because as they say everything isn't for everybody and you can't force nothing on someone. Well everything isn't appropriate for everyone; we all have our limits to everything and if you watch what kids watch and do than things won't be so inappropriate for this world. Certain books young children should not read because they have sex in them and they talk about things that a child should not even be thinking about at that age. When children read books like that they tend to think about sex and how what they read about will feel, but children should not be thinking about that type of stuff that why it's their parent's responsibility to monitor what their children read because that their job as parent's to do not the person who wrote the book because they @MONTH1 think they're writing to a much older group that can relate to what they're talking about, but then again they're just speaking their mind and enforcing their freedom of speech right, one of the rights that we as a people together have been fighting for. I also feel that music helps us to express ourselves so if someone feels that the music is inappropriate for their child then they need to watch what their child is listening to. Music brings out the different moods in everybody. All magazines are not for everyone because as we all know there are adult magazines the produce certain imagery that children should not see, but you can not blame the creator, only the buyer is in fault for leaving it in the wrong place after they're done with it. They're just people trying to make money off things that they know that people like, so ultimately, it comes down to individual responsibility and awareness.
883	3860	2	3	Don't you hate when you come across a book that you wish was never written? I'm sure we all come to that point in our lives, constant readers, or not. Like a quote I once read, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' - Katherine Paterson, Author. If you ask me, I think there should be a certain authority to these books. Maybe if we could make a petition and have at least @NUM1 one thousand people sign it then the book could be removed. All of this goes for music, movies, magazines, even bibles in libraries.  I'm not saying we should make a law that says if one person doesn't like something then nobody should have the right to have it. But as a public if enough people all agree we shouldn't have something then maybe it's best that we don't. We all worry about our children, having to keep a constant eye on them making sure they're not getting into something they're not supposed to be in. Same goes with books and movies, even music and magazines nowadays, and for certain people, even bibles.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm sure we all know that when a child goes to a library and tries to check out an 'inappropriate' book then the checkout counter will deny the child and take the book. But just think for a minute here, That doesn't mean the child can't go into the library find a book and just read it there. There's also the scenario where, mind me it @MONTH1 may not be your child but with today's crime records then this is very probable, the child could grab a book, magazine, even a film and just steal it.  In the long run there are many things we can do to prevent things like this from happening. There could be an adult section of the library, not just for '@CAPS1 R' rated books or films but just a place where we can keep all the books we don't think children should be reading. Still we should definitely have the option to petition off books we don't think our children should be reading. Think what you will but this is my opinion of library censorship, hopefully it's yours now too, as we work to balance freedom of access with the protection of our children.
884	3861	2	3	Why Should you be offended? The @CAPS1 is a place where you come and get what you like. The Libraries are organized for a reason; what I like is my preference. You don't have to look at it if you don't want to. Everyone has their own taste. Books, movies, music, and magazines are made for people to look at, read, watch, etc. People have a preference, and they like to have it available when they want it. Libraries are of great use for that. People go to get what they like to watch, read, and listen to, and other people should not get offended by what others like. Most Libraries are organized into sections for children, young adults, and adults. If there is material that you don't think is 'ok' for that section, then you can ask for it to be moved to another section. But don't think something is offensive and make it be removed because you don't like it. How is that fair to others who might like it? If you are offended by a material that is in a section of the @CAPS1 that you think is not 'ok,' then it is ok for it to be moved to another section. You don't have to look at something if you don't like it; someone else might like it. Libraries are made for all people, and everyone has their own taste, so don't be offended by what others like, as preference is personal and libraries cater to a wide array of interests.
885	3862	2	3	Libraries are a place for everyone; from young children, to the eldery, therefore there is material to suite all ages. When you go to a library you assume that no matter what kind of book you are wanting to read, they will have it. From personal prefrences, to school research projects, libraries should have it all right? Well some libraries want to take that concept away. A library has books on nearly all subjects. That is because of the individual differences of the people that go to the library. Someone of an extremist religion group could be going there to read on something of their religion. If a strict individual would happen to find a book on the extreme religion they could be offended. That situation could go both ways though. Because of the individuality of people and different beliefs and customs we are all going to appreciate and depreciate all different kinds of literature. Most of the libraries are big enough to be sorted into sections. There are sections for young adults, mature adults, children, non fiction, fiction, science fiction, and so on. If a child ventures off to the mature adult section and flips through the pages of a book that is above their maturity level, then that is the childs fault. The mature people who can handle the content of more adult-orientated books shouldn't be punished by the library removing all books of that content because a child didn't stay in their designated area. With different cultural beliefs comes different beliefs and views of everyday things. Some readers could strongly disagree with a book and others could recommend it to all of their friends and family. One book to one person could mean something totally different to another. It could be understandable if there were books about sex, for example, right next to the childrens' books, but that isn't the case in most libraries. Libraries could even have a restricted section that warns readers about the content of material in the books in that specific area. Books in libraries are wrote for multiple kinds of people. Age, gender, religion, maturity, race, political beliefs, and so on will all effect the way you take to a book. Whether or not a book appeals to you is about your beliefs, values, or customs. With that being said, why would a library take away books that only a certain percentage of people will disagree with? Taking away books of a certain subject could upset people that like that type of book or it could even pertain to their everyday lives. A library is a place of knowlegde. It is filled with facts, beliefs, theories, and opinions of people. Wouldn't removing someones opportunity to read into a subject be revoking the author and their freedom of speech? Just because of a controversial subject or mature topic shouldn't mean that people shouldn't be allowed to read it. If people could only read certain literature that someone else is deciding whether or not it is okay to read, then where is their freedom? A library is a place for everyone. It has all different kinds of books for all different kinds of people. A libraries interior could be arranged to that the young children aren't going to find a book about sex near their kid books. Taking away certain books pertaining to controversial subjects isn't fair to those who don't disagree with that topic. A library should be a place of balance, facilitating diverse perspectives and catering to varied interests without censorship, thus remaining a true haven for all. A place where someone could read on anything they want to, not what certain people think they should or shouldn't read.
886	3863	2	3	I believe everyone has the right to voice their own opinion on life. If we censor one's books, music, or movies because they are inappropriate, it would be like silencing an opinion that stands out among the others. If we silence the author and their story or song, how will we be able to view life in another person's view? In the United States we have the freedom of speech and press. These amendments make it so that others can voice an opinion without being shot down. Although we have the amendments, there are still restrictions on what we are allowed to publish. Say we found a diary written by Adolf Hitler? Are we allowed to view his deepest darkest thoughts? Or are we going to say that it is too dark and depressing for the average person's eyes? His ideas are different, does that mean we shouldn't show them? No, we should show them; we need to educate people that there are indeed different ways of viewing life. I believe that no matter whose ideas it is, if allowed by the author, should be allowed to be read and comprehended in our own way. If one wishes to learn about how to murder in a LIBRARY then I think they should be allowed to do so. The reason why; The LIBRARY is becoming obsolete, the technology era is officially here. There is not a thing we can't find in LIBRARIES that can't be found online. Although the LIBRARY is a government-run facility, many people will go elsewhere to find the materials wanted to view the censored media. It is true that if we allowed 'censored' material into a LIBRARY, a child could find it. But like the internet, you can block things from those kids. All voices need to be heard, even if it is racist, sexist, biased, or just insane. These are ways to view the perspective or the reason behind hate and war. If we can learn from other mindsets through books, music, and movies, then I think we should be allowed to. Nothing should be blocked from the public, as everyone has the right to voice their own opinion through their own way, and we should strive to understand those differing viewpoints.
887	3864	2	3	KEEP @CAPS1 BOOKS ON THE SHELF! I think we should not get rid of any books that are in the library. If we did that then there wouldn't be any books left. The only thing we should be worried about is the rated @CAPS2 R movies. Yeah those can be taken out of the library. If one book is offensive to someone, then don't get it, but someone else might like that book. For example, an older woman is looking through this magazine, and she sees this teenage woman taking drugs, or being half naked. Although the teen sitting right next to her likes that gossip. We shouldn't get rid of any books because then we would only be down to one genre. There wouldn't be any categories left in the library. A good idea is to separate the books, put the ones that seem offensive in the back, perhaps with a warning label. Keep the children's books away from the big mystery horror books. Another example is this. A student goes to the library to work on a history report over slavery, but there isn't any books on slavery because somebody thought it was offensive against African Americans. I understand that there is reasons why some books are taken out of the library because of some sexual content. Children do not need to be around those kinds of books. Or some books being taken out because of religious beliefs, like one book being taken out because it was about worshiping the devil, or something. The movie situation I understand. I wouldn't want my little daughter walking up and grabbing something that has a sex scene, or drug content in it. You can take those off the shelf, but wait, right there is another example of why it shouldn't get taken off the shelf. Just because I want it off the shelf doesn't mean everybody wants it off the shelf. Then the libraries movie business would be over. To sum everything up, nobody should choose what should be in the library and what shouldn't. Personally I think that there should be a variety in the library. If not everybody would get bored of the same books, over and over. KEEP @CAPS1 BOOKS ON THE SHELF, as censorship limits access to knowledge and diverse perspectives, hindering intellectual growth.
888	3865	2	3	"Katherine Paterson, who is an author, thought that if a book was not one that she would want her children to read that it should be taken off the shelf at the library. If you found a book in your public library offensive, would you want that book removed from your sight and public view? Personally, I wouldn't. I would not want the book to be removed because that book could be a good learning experience for others. In this essay, I will explain from my personal experience I disagree with Katherine Paterson. In the sixth grade, I learned about how to find a certain book in a public library using a system. We had to find certain books in our school library, using this system, as an assignment. One of the books we had to find was the Bible. I found it very easily because I knew where it should have been and what it looks like. But there was a child in my class who had never seen a Bible in her life. After helping her find the Bible, she asked, ""is this book so important to people? I don't understand it."" I explained to her in the best of my ability the life of Jesus and why this was important to me. She soon found out that it was something she wanted to learn more about. It is against the law in some states that a Bible be in school at all. This is because of others beliefs or non-beliefs. If it were not for the library having the Bible on a shelf that girl would never have learned something that is now important to her. A book can be offensive to other people but that book can change a person's life forever. Katherine Paterson believed that some books should not be found in libraries. Unfortunately, other people think this also. One book can change a person's life, what if that book was not in the library to change another? Therefore, it is crucial to maintain a diverse collection in libraries, ensuring that a wide range of perspectives and potential life-changing books remain accessible to everyone."
889	3866	2	3	I feel that a library can have any kind of book stating any kind of material. It's a library, a place where people go to get information. If you don't want your kid, or kids reading, watching, or listening to those kinds of material then you shouldn't have to let them read, listen to or watch any offensive material, until they are at a certain age and are mature enough about it. It is a library, and they are gonna have a wide variety of books. I don't think any book should be removed just because someone gets offended or it's too gory or has too many curse words for your kid. Not everyone gets offended by the same things, or the same material. If you do then don't read that book or watch that movie, but that shouldn't mean it has to be taken off the shelf just because one person got offended by it. Libraries are made for the community and the people in it, not just one person. Other people might want to read or watch the material that some people get offended by. This is what I think on the censorship on the book, movies, music, magazine, etc. It's a library, they are going to have a bunch of material. If you find something offensive, be mature, put it back and find something else to read, watch or listen to, because restricting access for everyone based on individual sensitivities ultimately undermines the library's purpose as a comprehensive resource for all.
890	3867	2	3	In a library, should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Many people feel upset if they find a book or magazine or any type of material that is inappropiate for anyone to see/hear. Inappropiate material is commonly referred to as pictures and or words that offend people. The words in songs can be offensive. Talking about girls in disrespectful ways in music can offend girls and listeners. Pictures can also be offensive in many ways such as sex, race, and violence.  I believe that, if a book, music, movies, or magazines upset you then you should stay away from that section or just that material in particular. If you have been to a library you see that kids mainly stay in the kids section anyways; and if you're an adult then you should be mature enough to ignore what bothers you. I have been in a library a few times in my life. When I search for what im looking for, I ignore what offends me or upsets me.  In a library, should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? My answer is no, for the reasons I have listed above. People should be mature enough to stay away from and not let the offensive materials in a library get to them; ultimately, personal responsibility is key to navigating potentially offensive content.
891	3868	2	3	Whose to say what is appropriate for whom? Whose to judge right and wrong for anyone? It depends on a point of view like most things. The sheltered must learn one day, and if kids learn now about the truth, such as, not to stick forks in outlets, then they won't be as curious when they are older. Being sheltered is not always a good thing and censorship of what we read, watch, or listen to is ridiculous, and disrespectful to authors, a form of intellectual dishonesty. In matters of censorship, I find it to be pointless. Censorship doesn't prevent your kids from learning about anything, except mother won't let me watch that. it just keeps your kids more curious and more obligated to hide things from you and like they cannot ask you questions or be open and honest with you. It causes children to go behind your back more and when they're in trouble they'll act as if you're their last place where they can ask for help, where you should be their first resort. No, I do not believe that libraries should censor anything. It's altering an author's work and voice. How would it feel if you had written something and it had been published and was in the library and someone didn't like something about it so they decided to just bleep it out or not allow certain people to read it? I believe censorship should be illegal not required. Sheltering things from kids prevents them from maturing, and discovering the real world and its complexities. The idea that the world has no evil, or hiding the evil from your children will in most cases cause them to rebel and in other cases leave them unprepared for the future and the real world, a world they'll inevitably enter. Wouldn't you rather be able to help your kids and teach them about things instead of telling them that everything is perfect and only bad people use that kind of language, potentially creating a stigma? Or make them feel like a bad person for doing something your grandparents did when they were young, creating a double standard? I conclude that censorship is unjust, unfair, and is the real wrong. Not the profanity or the violence that will one day be a part of their life in some way, a reality they will have to face. You don't go through everyday in the 'real world' with a mindset of there's nothing wrong in this world, or everything is censored and everything is controlled; I believe censorship is just another way of controlling the mind through nurture, shaping perspectives in a way that limits true understanding and critical thinking.
892	3869	2	3	I believe that it is unnecessary to remove items off shelves for offensive reasons. I feel this way for several reasons, but three in particular. First, it could be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading, and removing an item will let down the customer. Second, there are many solutions to try out before taking an item away. Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make. First, it could be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading, and removing an item will let down the customer. People come to libraries to look at what they're interested in to entertain themselves. There should be all types of literation in the library for all types of people, because everyone doesn't think alike. Everytime an item is removed off of a shelf, there will be an unsatisfied customer. Second, there are many solutions to try out before taking an item away. Libraries always have some type of organization. In order to not offend anyone, items should be divided into their own categories inside their own sections. This solution will prevent anyone from seeing something that offends them. If that doesn't help, librarians should post a sign stating what type of objects are inside on the front door, so everyone knows before they enter. Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make. A customers' needs and wants should be met at all times, unless a customer is trying to run the business as if it was their own. If a particular library chooses to have certain types of items, because they know what what readers' like, then no one else should involve theirself. If I owned a library, I would be upset if a customer removed a book off a shelf, because they would be interfering with my business. In conclusion, I beleve it is unnecessary to remove items off shelves for three reasons. First, it could be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading. Second, there are many solutions to try out before taking an item away. Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make. I believe I expressed my opinion to the fullest. Although some people may disagree with the way I feel, I'm sticking with it. There defintly wouldn't be any books left for any of us if items were removed for offensive reasons.
893	3870	2	3	Newspaper company, I am writing to this company to express my views on whether certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are deemed offensive. I am writing to share my own experiences and readings, aiming to construct a convincing argument. I am reflecting my views on censorship in libraries. I am writing so you can hear what I have to say and persuade you through this essay.  First, I don't think any book should be taken off any shelf of any library, regardless of whether it contains people’s thoughts on religion, race, or any other topic that has been offensive to anyone in the past. For example, consider people's thoughts and opinions on gay and lesbian marriage; no one should disrespect another's opinion. It depends on the language used. If it contains harsh words intended to be harmful, then yes, it should be removed. Regarding children taking books off shelves, parents should escort their children in the children's section and instruct them on appropriate behavior, such as not taking down things they are not supposed to. In essence, if content is intended to hurt others and uses negative words to harm others' feelings, it should be removed.  My letter aimed to show you my opinion on what should or should not be in a library. I have used examples and common sense to show you my point of view on what I think is right or wrong in this situation. I hope my topics and argument have convinced you on whether or not to remove a book from a shelf, based on the potential harm and offense it may cause.
894	3871	2	3	Are there universally evil books that no one should read? Are good and bad no longer matters of opinion for the readers themselves? The answer is no. Censorship is a terrible practice masquerading as a boon. The right to read certain books should not be left to a conservative few, because everyone has their own opinion about everything. There is always something we can potentially learn from books, and it's never right to take that away. Freedom of speech should certainly come into play here as well, allowing the authors' words to be heard without interference from those who would dictate what we read. There is a reason libraries have many sections. They have to cater to the individual tastes of the masses, without regard to what other people find offensive. If one was to go through the library and burn every book they did not like, there would be scarcely anything left. Send in another person with different tastes, and then you have a completely empty library. It is far better to leave all the books alone so that everyone can find something to enjoy reading. Basically, there are bound to be people who have similar opinions to the author of just about anything, so allow the authors to share those opinions. Then we have the knowledge portion of the issue. Offensive material to one person might be what another person wants or needs to read, whether for recreation or class. There is much to be learned in the way of psychology and human nature from almost any writing. Perhaps a restricted section would be in order if the problem would involve corruption of innocent minds, but a full censor would never be necessary. Finally, there is an amendment in the United States Constitution for preventing censorship. It is unconstitutional to restrict any form of expressive speech, whether it be books, movies, music, or magazines. And what is more restrictive to an author than to have their books banned? The greatest difference between our country and a totalitarian government is the simple freedom allowed in the United States. If we start restricting that freedom, what are we then? In short, censorship is a harmful practice that should never be used. People all have their own opinions, all media can be learned from, and our freedom should not be restricted. The practice of censorship is what should truly be banned from the shelves.
895	3872	2	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, is it safe to draw the line on what kids should or should not see as far as the world is concerned? What makes kids behave better, being sheltered from life or being life smart and knowing what is going on in this world? I think it's safe to say what we do or do not want our kids to do, say, etc. But, in other terms, do we have full control of our kids @NUM1? I know that this might sound weird, but I strongly believe in the simple fact that kids are being over-sheltered today! Our kids are growing up with the new technology. It's the century for computers and laptops and gaming systems. Our kids don't know what it's like to go outside anymore. The world has so much to offer us, yet we turn it down because we see what all the new advances have to offer as well. I think it is very important to be book smart as well as street smart; if you spend all your @CAPS3 doing one thing and at @CAPS3 you are gonna end up lacking on one thing. I believe grades will come. I think that our kids are over-sheltered for the simple fact that when our kids see something that we don't want them to see, or they're not ready for, then they're not allowed to see it, but who's to say on the days you're not watching them that they're not going to go in the real world and just see exactly what you didn't want them to? This is why it's important for you to teach your child what is going on in the world and not leave them in the dark. Also, we are living in the new age of life, where computers and laptops are the number one thing in the world right now for people to be using and on throughout the day. It is hard for kids to understand the realness of life since everything is done over the internet now. It is a privilege to be so far advanced in the world, yet we still don't know what to do! As we get older we are not gonna know nearly as much stuff as need to be known and taught because as we get older we're getting more logic and more information over the materials on the web. Kids will not know how to fix cars or know how to start up a lawn mower. I think that books should not be taken off the shelf because as the day goes by kids' reality is getting taken and taken more and more! I think that it is a big deal what kids learn about everyday life because that is our future, and if they have no idea what is going on it scares me because there are going to be a lot more battles for our kids to fight; we just have to teach them all that we can and hope that they become the best people they can be in life! Thank you for your @CAPS3! Deven. Ultimately, finding a balance between protecting children and preparing them for the complexities of the world is essential for their development and future success.
896	3873	2	3	Censorship in libraries has been around for as long as their has been the various mediums of art. In many cases the censorship consists of what many would agree as not suitable material for anyone to create and enjoy. But then in other more serious issues that the censor has deemed not suitable for a certain audience, or even to a whole country. What is it that gives a select few the right to ban any given number of imaginative creations, even if they are in some aspects more lued in nature? Censorship has and is still a very usefull tool that many governments employ to accomplish a wide variety of tasks, considered to ensure the 'safety' of both our minds and bodies. Some of the more widely know cases of this most despicable tactic of control come from the countries of China, Russia, North Korea, Myanmar, Iran, and Vietnam. In these countries all materials that are deemed potentially hazardous to the wellfare of the state are heavily policed and in many cases destroyed. The most noteworthy instances of this occured in North Korea, where the government would gather up large amounts of books from the people and burn them in massive rallies. The people were so enthralled by the Kim's leadership that they would often times freely relenquish their books with no resistance, and in some cases join in and throw the books in themselves. The same thing is still occuring in Vietnam today, wtih a censor still on their internet surfing possibilities. In 2010 the popular search engine Google attempted to set up shop in the country, but quickly entered into dispute with the state about the censoring of certain materials. Some months after the argument began over the censoring of Vietnam's people, the company completely removed all bans for a short time, much to the dismay of the state. During that time it was reported that some of the main search topics were that of many social reformers and of different religions than that of the state's sanctioned religion. But the one country that takes the cake for having the most censorship is North Korea, they're government has restricted and policed any technology in the country. The common people live in a so called 'hermit kingdom'. In our home country of the United States we are promised many rights to protect our freedom as citizens. We are promised the freedom of speech as well as press, and in censoring our libraries they would restrict both. If we do not stand up and protect our rights, then who will? Are we not a government for the people, by the people? Why are we allowing the censorship of our own intellectual creations in a place that was created to provide access to said materials for those who are less fortunate, so they themselves can gain knowledge and understanding. If we as a people were to allow such a blatent restriction on our given freedoms, then we are in no position to have them in the first place. Our country was founded and later almost torn apart by the men and women who were willing to risk it all in order to protect their freedoms in this country. Are we descendants of those same people? If so why should we allow ourselves to squander what was hard fought for and earned by our forefathers. The censor often poses a few questions that do cause one to wonder 'is it really better off this way?'. They point out that for every great work of intellegent art, other of a more deviant nature create some more innapropriate pieces of 'art'. Pornography is the most prevalent of their examples, pointing out that if they did not restrict it, then who would stop the hundreds of children that not only roam the libraries bookshelves but also the provided internet services. It is a reasonable question, once that should be take into consideration, but in answer to it I believe that it is and will always be the job of the parent or guardian that bring the child with them. It is simply not enough to drop a child off at the local library and hope they find something interesting. Helping that child find what they want is a journey that should be taken by both the parent and the child. And what about those who believe the censor isn't always right about what is and what is not acceptable for the general library? As author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Censorship has been around for a very long time, and will most likely never be fully cut out of any functioning state. That is sadly an inevitability that cannot be avoided. But the amount that it occurs in your daily life will be directly affected by how much of your freedom you are willing to stand up for, so we must be constantly
897	3874	2	3	Almost everyone in this world reads. Many people have to read almost every day, people may not realize it but they do. Reading is just a part of life. If you don't know how to read you are most likely to not be successful. Even if you know how to read a little bit, if you just knew the basic words people would probably be fine, but people definitely need to know how to read. No, I do not think they should take anything off the shelf. Why would they take anything off the shelf? If anyone finds it offensive they should simply not read it. Just because it offends them, other people may find it interesting. If people just started taking books off the shelf because they were offended by them, who knows how many books we would have left. People can be offended in the most easiest ways. We could have no books on the shelf because almost every book out there can offend someone in a way. The same thing with movies; movies can offend people just the same as books. I think movies would offend more than a book would. In conclusion, books, movies, or anything of that matter should not be taken off the shelf because it offended someone. Many people get offended in this world way too easily. One person might love a book and another person hate it. Just because you hate it does not mean it should be taken off the shelf.
898	3875	2	3	Censorship is one of many important issues facing the world today. Many argue that materials considered offensive are damaging to society, and should not be tolerated. Others believe that freedom of speech is a universal right that should extend to any and all forms of human expression. The issue is further complicated by the concept of what is and is not appropriate for children. Are there materials that are acceptable for adults, but not kids? Questions such as this have plagued humanity for hundreds of years, and there is no simple solution. Today, so many people think of censorship as a bad word. In fact, there is nothing inherently wrong with the concept of censorship. It is only when people begin to abuse their power and censor materials that should not be censored that problems arise. For example, many countries have restrictions on selling and owning copies of 'Mein Kampf,' the book that Adolf Hitler wrote as a sort of mission statement for Germany. While many of the ideas contained within the book are horribly offensive, it still should not be censored. People have the right to read the book and form their own opinions on Hitler's teachings, it is not the government's place to decide for them. While oppressive dictatorship and mass-murder are crimes, reading about them is not. There are few materials available that should rightfully be censored and taken out of adult hands. If someone understands what they are reading, and are able to form an educated opinion on the material, then nobody has the right to stop them from expanding their knowledge, or expressing themselves by creating similar material. However, the issue changes completely when one considers children. If adults want to view pornography, or read accounts of extreme violence, that is their business. However, those concepts are obviously inappropriate for children, and any decent parent wouldn't want their young kids filling their heads with such things. Children need to be slowly and gently introduced to these concepts so they can fully understand them. In the case of children, careful censorship is necessary for healthy development. When it comes to libraries, there are very few materials that should be banned. If libraries are meant to be places of learning, then one has no right to limit the information they contain. However, that does not mean there should not be any limitations. Libraries should offer a children's section, as many do, that would contain materials only appropriate for youngsters. Then, it becomes the parents' responsibility to ensure that their child stays in that section. When a parent believes the child is ready to explore the adult section, they are free to take their kid there. This system gives parents the ability to keep their children away from harmful material, without taking it out of the hands of adults. Many would argue that unsupervised children could gain access to inappropriate material, but that is really an issue that needs to be handled by parents, not the library. After all, it's better that a few kids see something they shouldn't have than all adults have to read censored material. In conclusion, censorship is a concept that has its place in society, but must be used very carefully. When the goal is to protect people, especially children, from harmful material, it can be used sparingly. However, when those in power use censorship to attack ideas they disagree with, it becomes a form of oppression. Above all else, people must be free to educate themselves, form their own opinions, and express themselves; to censor these rights is to limit the human experience. If someone doesn't like a piece of material, they can leave it alone, but they should never try to take it out of someone else's hands.
899	3876	2	3	Books can make a very deep impression on whoever reads them, and sometimes these impressions are not appropriate for the reader. Books that are found inappropriate to children or even teenagers should be reconsidered to be removed off shelves that are exposed to children or teenagers. I think that children should not learn inappropriate material if they are not ready to learn about it, in other words if they are not age appropriate. Books are just one thing, there are also movies, music, magazines, and etc. All of these things can give wrong ideas to our children and teenagers. Inappropriate media or imformation should not be exposed to people that are not ready, or mature enough to watch movies, or read books that could harm or give them wrong impressions. Children that have read books or watched inappropriate media can sometimes change how they are like. I think that many children that watch movies especially that should not be exposed to them. Some of the movies that I have seen have been very inapropriate and I could not imagine young children watching these movies. This is because I do not think children know as much as we do, so it will give them wrong ideas they have taken the wrong way. I think that books or media that is inappropriate can change childrens childhoods in a negative way. Children and teenagers should also be mature enough to be exposed to all of the books, movies, and magazines. If all the age groups would be exposed to all of the higher rated movies, books, and magazines I dont think that would be very resbonsible on the libraries part, or whoever was exposing it. I think that society would be harder to control with this kind of media everywhere. Parents would also not appreciate if their children were reading, or seeing something that they think their child should not be exposed to. I think that children are simply not mature enough to be exposed to all of the books, magazines, and movies. It would cause a lot of problems for many people. Many of the children would be doing stupid things that they have seen in a movie or read in a book that they thought was cool, or that they should try it. Were are already having a problem with pre-teens or teengers. This is because many of them are exposed to things at a early age they should not see, that effect there actions. There are many actions I have seen or heard of that relate to a book, or movie that probaly would not have happened if the person was not exposed to it. Children simply are not ready, or mature enough to be exposed to everything that books, movies, or magazines have to offer. It can change the way that children think, or what they think would be cool to physically do. I think that it is bad enough that a lot of teenagers have been exposed to a lot of these things already. This should be a wake up call for those who have children, urging greater caution and awareness. Books shold not be exposed to every age group, because it would hurt society and whoever is not ready to learn or witness what they will. Ultimately, protecting children's innocence and guiding their development requires careful consideration of the media they consume.
900	3877	2	3	Censorship has become a major topic when it comes to books, music, and movies. These are being censored because people don't want young kids to read, listen, or watch these materials. What about the adults? Books, music, and movies being taken off of the shelfs in libraries because of censorship, is not fair to the adults. Books now are being rewriten so they won't have offevsive language in them. *Huckleberry Finn* is a classic example of this. Changing the offensive language in this book would totally ruin it. This book is mainly about the racism that whites had towards the african americans, and if that was altered the readers wouldn't get a sense of that racism. If libraries have books that are censored they should put them on a shelf just for censored books so adults could still be able to read them. Music is another peice of material that censorship has gotten a hold of. Offensive language is being taken out of songs and uncensored cd's are not being sold in some stores because of censorship. Some adults like the original songs with the original words. Libraries should carry both the explicit and the clean verions of cd's to they some them that are suitable for kids and the ones that adults can listen to. Movies are another peice of material that censorship has taken over. They are being rated G, suitable for all ages, PG, suitable for children 13 and older, and rated R, suitable for people 17 and older. These rating are good guidelines, but parents should be the ones to make the final decision on whether or not their child should be able to watch a certain movie. Libraries should have all kind of movies on their shelfs. If a twelve year old kid wants to watch a PG or rated R movie, he or she should be able to with the consint of a parent or guardian. Censoship is a good thing but it doesn't need to be taken to the extreme. If an adult wants to read a censored book, he or she should still be able to read it at their local libary and if a young kid wants to watch a rated R movie, he or she should be able to with the consint of a parent or guardian, because at the end of the day, adults should still have access to the materials they want, and parents should have the right to decide what their children can consume.
901	3878	2	3	There should not be certain kinds of books removed from the library. Books should not be taken off the shelf just because some people find them offensive. If you do not like the book, do not get the book; other people might like it, it's just for entertainment. If you do not like the book you do not have to get the book. While looking for a book, if there is one that does not seem right, just look past it. It will not even be a bother. There are a lot of books in the library, just find a different book instead of focusing on that one book. There will always be many more books there to look at. If there is a book you dislike, just go to a different section in the library. There is going to be more good books for a person than books that are not to their liking.  If other people would like the book, then the library should not remove the book off of the shelves. It might be offensive to some people, but there will be some other people in the world that like that same book. Some people go to the library just to see those kinds of books. Certain people like certain types of books; maybe it was not the right section for a person to be in. The book could be an interesting book; all there is to do is try it. If anything, the reader might even like the book and check it out.  The books are there for entertainment. That's why they have so many different sections and selections to choose from. If an adult does not like a kid's book because it's giving the kid the wrong idea, then do not get the book for the kid. A different parent might come in and think that the book will be great for their child, though.  Books should be out on the shelf for anybody that goes to the library. The librarians will not take books off the shelf for one person's opinion when all they have to do is not get the book, think that others might like it, or remember they are there for the readers' entertainment; this is the most reasonable approach to handling diverse viewpoints in the library.
902	3879	2	3	I think censorship is stupid when it comes to putting it on adult shows. I can see why they put it on the kids' shows, but really? You guys will put that stuff on good movies, or songs!? What has ever happened to freedom of speech? It seems like artistic expression is being stifled, and mature audiences should be able to make their own choices about what they consume; ultimately, such restrictions limit our ability to engage with art in a meaningful way.
903	3880	2	3	Dear Newspaper: There should be censorship in libraries, but people should be a certain age just to check the book out. Some people go to the libraries just for censorship. These days censorship basicly is how you get children or students just to pick up a book. Plus, if the parents aloud their child to read cebsorship books because they think it does no harm to the child which it don't. Put a @NUM1 and older section in the libraries so any and every body will not be able to enter unless they have @CAPS2 just to solve the age problem. However you do it the libraries will lose the little money they are getting from the people. I no you think censorship should be taking off every shelf in the libraries, but they really shouldn't because I believe if you do that then the libraries will go out of business for good. That is the reason why the libraries should keep censorship on there selvies. I'm finish but I will leave you with this question: do you really want to take censorship out the libraries? So, keeping censored materials available, while restricting access based on age, might be a compromise that ensures the library's survival and continued relevance.
904	3881	2	3	Now take a moment and go back to highschool. Do you remember roaming under the opera house with the phantom? What about fighting for @PERSON2's freedom with @PERSON1? Perhaps getting people into trouble in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS1? No matter what your favorite classic piece of literature was, you recall the wonderful feeling you felt when reading it. It enveloped you into its world, and you felt every sensation it offered. What is this though? The author is a @CAPS2. The author uses occassional bad words. The author is a woman. This is not an acceptable excuse to miss out on everything literature offers. Censorship in public libraries is wrong. The @CAPS3 was a dark time in history. Thousands upon thousands of @CAPS4 people were killed for their religious belief, as well as homosexual people, and other minorities. Amidst all of this chaos, the @ORGANIZATION1 decided it would be a good idea to burn all books written by @CAPS4 authors. So they did. Millions of books were eradicated along with their owners all because of a religious difference. Does it even need to be asked? This was wrong, a blatant violation of human rights and freedom of expression. Many say that ignorance is bliss, but is it really when people impose their ideas on others? Let us now look now at what a book, movie, magazine, or song offends with to be censored. A curse word, a bit of skin, a controversial idea. Sometimes these are needed for emphasis of the compilation, providing realism and depth. Imagine how much less forceful an angry character would be without a few curses every now and then. Pathetic. So is it worth it to you? Will you give up a beautiful composition because it is controversial? Will you hide your children from materials that will make them form their own opinions, stifling their intellectual growth? One thing is certain, I will not. I will stand against censorship until it has felt the mighty blow that it has inflicted on so many beautiful works. One day my plea will be heard, and literature will be freely accessible to all. Censorship in public libraries is wrong no matter how you put it.
905	3882	2	3	There are a bunch of very good books at a public library, you can get all kinds of different types of books. You can find a book on anything you really need, any facts you need to know or anything you want to know how to do; I'm sure there is a book out there that can help you out. Just because a book is an opinion doesn't mean it needs to be taken off shelves. Everyone looks at everything differently. If you read, it can help you in many different ways, you can learn a lot just from reading a book and expanding your knowledge base. Me personally, I hate reading, so I don't learn much from books. I'm more of a hands-on type of person; words just fly through one ear and out the other really. It is really hard to understand when I'm trying to read, and if I listen or write and listen, I lose my thoughts too easily.
906	3883	2	3	My say would be no. because all that was history, say you had like a KKK thing or anything like that. say you had a writing report but need the information for that. you would need information for that and that information would have notes, dates and other things. Therefore, even potentially offensive historical information is essential for understanding and writing about the past, and suppressing it would hinder accurate research and analysis.
907	3884	2	3	I believe in censorship, but I don't think it's a huge issue. Parents should block materials they deem inappropriate for their children. If something is truly harmful, parents have the right to protect their kids from it. My view on censoring books, music, movies, and magazines is that some content isn't suitable for younger audiences without parental consent.  Censorship, to me, means removing things people dislike. If something is genuinely wrong, censoring it is justified. However, if it's minor, like a single word in a book, people should be more understanding and try to see past it or address it differently.  If you dislike something, simply avoid it. If it's truly offensive, keep your children away from it. I've never encountered a book so offensive that I wanted to ban it entirely. I've read books I disliked, but nothing warranting complete censorship.  Censorship should be reserved for legitimate reasons, not personal dislike or disagreement with ideas. It should target content that promotes hatred against races or is excessively graphic for children. Censoring based on personal preferences is wrong, and should be reserved for genuinely harmful materials. It's a parent's right to decide what their children are exposed to, and that's how it should be, which is the right way to approach the topic.
908	3885	2	3	If I was given the chance to choose if people should take books off of shelves or not that offend people at local libraries, I would think neither taking the books off the shelf, nor leaving them on **the shelves** are quite correct. I would definitely recommend a voting to take place, in order to figure out what to do with the books. I would say a vote would be reasonable because many people have many different beliefs, in which some could be offended. So I would take at least ten different people with different religions, backgrounds, and so forth, and I would have them all vote on which they thought they should do with the offensive books. People believe differently, so it would be hard to please them all. That's why a vote with different types of people would be effective for almost anyone. Just like my mom said, 'you will never make everyone happy.' **There** are so many things out in the society today that can offend people, and what might majorly offend one, might have no effect on the other. This is the main reason voting is rough, because **there** is a wide variety of people on earth today. You would have to probably also look at how many times the book has been checked out before, because **there** is a possibility that no one in the voting group has the same opinion as those who have checked it out before. Although if the book is voted to stay in the library, I believe the book should be labeled in the correct area. Due to the fact that the book could be offending to some people, it should be labeled in case someone who doesn't know, like a child, comes upon that book. Voting is used in our society today and has been very effective for many years now. Voting doesn't only have to be used during an election, but also can be used for this reason as well. Voting is always important and people should notice that. I believe that voting could be the answer to many problems in the world today, and it offers a balanced approach to handling sensitive material in libraries.
909	3886	2	3	When ever has a few bad things being said ever effected how or what people read A days. That's what is hot in this present lifetime. No one wants to read a boring article, not unless it's meant to be. I'm going to share with you my opinions on certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, ect.,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I have observations, experience, and reading some of my the articles that were called offensive to prove my opinions. In my opinion, no ones work should be taken off of a shelf due to any thing, because I'm sure they worked on it an awful lot for it to be placed on a shelf. So there is no reason for it to be taken off. If that was my stuff that had got took off the shelves I would be shocked and upset. So that is one reason why you shouldn't do that. It could hurt people emotionly. Following that statement, but there can be times where you just don't want them to be seen because they are to embarrassing. Such as an athlete interviewed in an article, that got suspended from their sport due to violations, and this athlete is just cursing and being out of control. I would put that article away also, just so the public won't see it and no one is put on blast. Finally, everyone knows that some types of movies, and music can't be put on display in public. So you would have to ask for the movie or item and someone will go get it from the back for you, due to explicit content or explicit lyrics. G, should be the only movies allowed on shelves, rated and up should be behind counter, and the same with music. I am pretty sure that is clear with this audience. Now that I have shared with you my opinions on different views on censorship in libbraries what is you thoughts on this topic as you read this persuasive essay. You have read my thoughts on experience, observations, and just common sense on this topice. If you had to write an essay on censorship in libraries, how would you come about this. It's a complex issue, balancing artistic freedom with the need to protect individuals from potentially harmful content, and finding the right balance is key.
910	3887	2	3	Materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines are used for peoples enjoyment. Adults and kids get a lot of information out of the libraries reading materials. Books give people another way to learn new things, instead of in a class. If the reading materials are already in the classroom they should not be removed. If someone is walking into a library, they have to be responsible. Adults along with young adults have to know what they should read and whats not acceptable. No one has the right to take a book off of the shelf, because they think its offensive. There are millions of book in the world that people find offensive. Theres not one perfect book in this world that doesn't bother somebody. Every single book that is made today has a right to be read. Theres people out in the world looking for a certain book, magazine, movie, and even music. That material is hepling find the answer to a problem, giving the right decision, and helping someone walk in the right path. The @CAPS1 is a book of understanding and knowledge. There are a good number of people how think we shouldn't read it, or even pick it up. Like the @CAPS1 say, free will. It's our free will to pick up books we want to read. Books give people another way to learn new things. Adults and kids get a lot of information out of the libaries reading materials. Books, music, movies, and magazines are used for people's enjoyment, and should remain accessible for those seeking guidance, knowledge, or simply, enjoyment.
911	3888	2	3	No, censoring books, music, movies, magazines, etc. takes away from our freedom as an American citizen. If you think books should be censored, then think about this. Would they take 'hell' or 'damned' out of the Bible because those words are considered offensive? I do not think so, those words give power to the book. Censored books are an insight to history and culture. Taking away these books will limit education. Books should not be censored.  A very recent and much talked about case of censorship is the popular book *Huckleberry Finn*. The book tells the story of a young white boy running off with an older black man. In the story, the word 'nigger' is used frequently. A lot of people were offended by the using of this word, so they republished a new version of the book, replacing 'nigger' with 'slave.' Some people were happy with the word change, but others felt that by censoring the word they were taking away a very vital part of the story. I agree with the latter statement. The story's setting was back when black people were slaves and known as niggers. I agree that the word nigger carries a heavy connotation, but that is the purpose of using the word. The author used it so that the reader could get a feel for what life was like back then. When thinking about the coming generations, who will not know about slavery or black oppression, the book gives a raw insight into how life was for a black man. The word itself is a symbolism of slavery; without it, the book is not as powerful.  Censorship is a fine line, and everybody has a different place where they draw that line. The story of *Huckleberry Finn* is just one example of censorship. On television, nudity and language is censored when deemed inappropriate. It should be up to the parent to decide which books their child should read, which magazines they should buy, and which television programs they should watch. If the parent sees the book as offensive or thinks that their child should not read it, then they should be the ones who make sure their child does not read it. The books should not be taken off the shelf because they will entertain and educate other children or parents. Books should not be censored; if a person does not think the book is appropriate, then they do not have to read it, thus maintaining freedom of choice and access to diverse perspectives.
912	3889	2	3	Imagine, Mom, you are in the library looking for a book to read, to when your son or daughter runs up to you holding a magazine of questionable nature. What do you do? A library should not have inapporiate items on the shelves. Censoring libraries is something to protect you and your family. Libraries should be censored so that way everyone can enjoy themselves. The first reason I thing that libraries should be censored is because of the children that go there. Children are curious and they are always attracted to things that are colorful and different. An example I have of Mom is my baby sister. She wanted to go to the zoo instead of the museum because as she said 'I want to see the animals, not a boring statue. I can see those anytime around town.' Mom is showing that children want to see different things and if they were to go to the library and see the same items then there is not anything to worry about. The first time they see something of questionable nature they would want it because it is new. The second reason that libraries should be censored is that sometimes not all of the items in the library are put in the right place. Say that you wanted to watch a movie that sounded really good and you checked it out at the library, went home, put it in, and find out it is not the movie you thought it was. What if you rented that movie for a party and had guests over? Would that not embarrass you? Well something like that happened to my cousin but she got a bad movie. She was embarrassed for weeks after it happened. All of that embarrassment could have been prevented if the libraries had to be censored. The third reason that libraries should be censored is that sometimes seeing certain material in a library can be rather offensive. Would you be offended by seeing something like that? I know that I would. I would not want anyone to be offended like that. When I was little I went to the mall with my grandmother. We were trying to buy a new pair of jeans for me. I got offended when the salesperson said that I 'looked fat' in the jeans I had picked. I know what it is like to be offended and people should take other peoples' feeling into account before they offend. While some people thing that inapporite material is fine to have in a library I believe that they should find other places for it. Think of your family and how much you love them. Think of what not having a censor on the libraries can cause. Do you want to be responsible for not doing anything to help? Try to find ways to get stricter laws on censoring libraries, ensuring a safe and comfortable environment for everyone.
913	3890	2	3	Why should books that some people enjoy to read be removed off of library shelves? That is ludicrous. There are so many alternatives then to just take those certain books off the shelves completely. We all have seen or heard of books that are inappropriate to certain audiences. It is understandable that young children should not read or be associated with these kind of materials such as: books, magazines, poems, movies, songs. It is totally unnecessary for children to be reading such explicit material, but it is possible for us to prevent it.  One way libraries throughout the nation can prevent this is by making completely different libraries or have the explicit materials be located in the total opposite side of the library from the children's materials. I know that libraries tend to have opposite corners of the library dedicated to adult materials and childrens materials, but there should be more strict rules of kids being in the adult section. We need to create a safe and appropriate reading environment for children.  Another idea is to have parental permission on the child's own library card telling the librarian, when the child checks out a book, where in the library they can get a book. For example maybe the childs' parents only will allow him/her to get materials from the children's section in the library; therefore if that child wants a material from a different area of the library they cannot get it, unless his/her parents are their telling the librarian the child is allowed to get it. This would place the responsibility where it belongs: with the parents.  I know when i was a child and i couldn't do something that my parents were doing, it made me feel upset, but now that i look back i realize why they wanted me not to do what they were doing. They wanted me to be a child as long as possible. They knew if i was reading or listening inappropriate materials then i was growing up way too fast. I know that now and understand it now what they wanted for me, which was to protect my innocence.  To conclude, lets keep those books and magazines away from the younger kids, but let's not ban them from libraries. I don't want to see it get banned from the libraries or taken out of libraries; I just want to see parents stepping up to be parents and not letting their young children be exposed to that kind of thing. It isn't the libraries faults if people's children are being exposed to this explicit material; it's the parent's fault for letting it happen, and by taking responsibility, we can ensure our children's well-being without resorting to censorship.
914	3891	2	3	Should materials that are offensive be taken off shelves? Should movies you loved and used to watch when you were a kid be gone in an instant? Magazines are offensive; they always have been. They get the truth out of celebrities and people, and they twist their words into something totally different from what they said. There are tons of movies in this world that will show harm to people, replay a bad part of somebody's life, say things about people. Music is just words and sound; they make songs about people that have done stuff in the past, that people would find offensive. I have seen a music video about @PERSON1 and making fun of her being in jail, but do I think that should be taken off the computer? No, it's entertaining. This world needs something to keep us entertained. Imagine what it would be like if we had no news reporters, no paparazzi. We wouldn't know anything going on around the world, and seeing the things about celebrities that they would find offensive, I can understand where they are coming from, getting talked about all the time, especially about mistakes you have made in your lives, but that's how the world functions, that's always going to be a part of everyone's lives, talk.  So, as I have been saying, getting rid of movies, music, magazines, books that are offensive would not be a good choice in my opinion, because what would entertain us if they were gone? Without these things, our access to information and entertainment would be severely limited, and the world would become a much less interesting place.
915	3892	2	3	In @LOCATION1, it is in our constitution that says anyone can have freedom of speech. Freedom to say anything they wish to get off their mind and express individuality and opinions. This should also include books, music, movies, magazines, and any other form of entertainment. However, there will always be people that could take offense to others' ideas and opinions that comes with freedom of speech. In a case where someone was to find a certain type of material to be offensive at a public library, then it should be known that he or she should not observe the type of material given. He or she should not throw a tantrum over something that they find offensive while other people find very enjoyable. It is in that person's standpoint that they should realize and come to grips with freedom of speech. What they @MONTH1 not like could very be what others do like. So, why should other peoples' form of enjoyment be censored and taken away from them just because of one bad lemon? It shouldn't. Everyone expresses themselves in their own way. It's a form of getting positive and/or negative energy out in a healthy way. Whether it's writing books, posting articles, or writing music, it's a way to vent and some people @MONTH1 like that venting person's style. It is completely up to that person who takes offense to materials on whether or not to observe such style. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries. If there was a type of censorship, it would be taking away what some person would like to enjoy. It would also be taking away the artists' or authors' freedom of speech and expression. There are books that were banned from schools throughout the country. Just because they think is right doesn't always mean it is right. Sure, they just want the people protected from certain offensive stuff, but why keep them from the real world? Let people out to see what this world is like and it's various types of art. Ultimately, the decision of what to consume should rest with the individual, protecting both freedom of expression and the right to choose.
916	3893	2	3	Censorship for books? Never thought I'd see the day. But, that doesn't necessarily mean I approve or agree. Just because I don't approve or agree doesn't mean I do not oppose it. I find that need taking a step back and arguing both sides is sufficient and fair. Shall we? Among others, I find that if you censor one thing, you censor them all. Public items such as televisions, radios, magazines, and even books have wriggled their way into our not so perfect world. Yes, there are crimes and indecencies happening as you read this. But, is it entirely fair to say that these public items have completely influenced and brainwashed children into early adulthood? Maybe. Then again, maybe not. It is true that children, at their youngest, are easily molded and cut out into who they will permanently be, or at least until they're old enough to form their own opinions on certain topics. For instance, when I was younger, my cousin, who happens to be just a few years older than me, started to like a certain thing. After spending time with her for an elongated amount of time, I started to 'like' it too. I found myself obsessed with it. Now, before you start getting it into your mind that it was something bad, I can assure you, it was nothing other than stacks of Yu-Gi-Oh! cards. Anyway, it wasn't until later that my mother informed me that it wasn't really my interest. It was hers. I modeled after her likes and dislikes. Every other child in the world has done something similar. What makes anybody think they wouldn't do the exact same after listening to uncensored music, watching uncensored television, or reading an uncensored book or magazine? On the other hand, it would be unfair to take away some books that people find to be improper or indecent. If that were the case, nearly every book would be out of sight, but not out of mind. Today, you can't turn on the radio without hearing something about sex, drugs, alcohol, or smoking. Now, those things are a lot more accessible to anybody. You can't turn on the computer without advertisements for porn or other sexually crude websites popping up on your screen. Books have gotten out of hand, as well. The world nowadays has gotten ridiculous and out of place. But in the end, I'm sticking to my original opinion: If you censor one thing, censor them all. It's only fair. Radios, television, movies, and even newspapers have been censored. Books are not as innocent as they seem, anymore. So yes, my final opinion is that libraries should, in fact, censor their books, or at least make an effort to. Libraries are places to learn and have fun doing so, not have a mental scar leading back to what they read in a 'harmless' little book, and censorship might be the answer to ensuring that learning environments remain safe and beneficial for everyone.
917	3894	2	3	'You are not eligible to check out this book', says the librarian. You are just too young for this book. To me censorship laws in libraries are not needed. The common people should have the liberty to check out whatever they please. The people who make the censorship laws should be pleased that young people actually want to read.  Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are all under censorship. Everyone takes things in differently, being said some are more mature than others. If they want to play that game, or read that book they should be allowed. The person who picks up the product should know how they are and should know if they can handle the material. Therefore they are held accountable for their actions. Isn't that how legal laws are carried out?  If any sort of content is found offensive it still shouldn't be removed from the shelves. Something may seem offensive to one person but someone else may find that interesting. For example, when the newspaper talks about a specific athlete they may say things that offends his/her fans. The people who are not fans of him/her may find it amusing; so they should remove the post because some people don't like it. Someone may like that book, music, movie, or magazine don't inconvenience them because of a few people.  Interest may vary, but a teen may like the same type of books as an adult. Censorship laws won't let the teen read the book they likes because of his/her age, and to me that is unfair. It is a new day and age; things have changed from what they once were. Censorship laws should be wiped out completely. If you may find a book offensive in any way, shape, or form just don't read it. Nobody is forcing to read that specific book; libraries are filled up with a numerous amount of books. There is a book out there that you will enjoy.  In conclusion, certain material shouldn't be removed from shelves if found offensive. Some other people may like that same material. There shouldn't be censorship laws in libraries at all. That is just unfair, and unjust to some people. It's a new time and age and things are different; people of any age should be able to check out any book they please, making personal choice the guiding principle.
918	3895	2	3	The things we find in libraries shouldn't be offensive to anybody. It's the choice you make whether you want to read it or not. Nobody is making you look at those things if you don't want to. Don't look at it, if you think it's offensive. The best thing to do is to keep it on the shelves. Some people like looking or reading things like that. People don't go to the library and pick up a book or a movie that they know they wouldn't like. If that was to happen, then there wouldn't be any library around because anything you get from the library, I bet you can find something offensive about it. People find stuff like that entertaining when they watch or read stuff like that, because it offers a different perspective or explores challenging themes.  That hurts the people that make the books and movies that are offensive because they feel like that's what people want to see. True enough that's what people want to see as long as it's not affecting them in any kind of way. That what we see on a daily basic on tv is offensive things, so if we can sit there and watch it on tv then we shouldn't have any problem reading or watching a book about it. I see offensive stuff on tv almost everyday, but it doesn't bother me so reading a book or anything else like that, I wouldn't care because i'm use to seeing it on tv.  Nobody can make you read or stop reading things like that, only you can. You don't have to look at it if you think its offensive. It shouldn't be a problem with anyone because that's what we hear and see everyday. No matter what, some people find that entertaining. Therefore, maintaining a diverse collection and respecting individual choices is the most reasonable approach to library content.
919	3896	2	3	"What is censorship? Censorship is editing or just plain getting rid of content. Censorship can be a good thing, but it could also be a bad thing. Does censorship really help in our society? Actually think about it, there are still murders, rapes, and whatever else, even with censorship in place. How I would argue this, is by listing my own experiences, observations, and readings.  Firstly, my experiences would have to be about movies and/or television shows. In some movies, you get to choose what version you want to watch: the unrated version or the censored version. Well, most people want to watch the unrated version because it's more than likely funnier and shows more. Other people might choose the censored version because they have children and don't want them watching stuff that would be in the unrated version. I would preferably pick the unrated version, because I like all the funny parts that wouldn't show in the censored version. Then there are those television shows that 'bleep' out a lot of words, because, of course, you are not allowed to say them on television. Parents don't want their six-year-old going around and saying all of those nasty words. That's why most of the time you hardly ever see those kinds of shows on in the afternoons; they are usually on at 8 PM or later.  Secondly, my observations about movies and/or television shows. I can't say that I don't watch shows that have some language in them, nor can I say that I don't watch shows that are all bloody and gory. I do watch them, but I would never watch them around my younger sister! She is eleven years old, and I don't want my little sister going to school and saying a bad word and have a teacher hear her. Then she would say, ""Well, Ashley was the one who watched the movie."" I would also never ever watch a bloody, gory, and really graphic movie in front of her either. Some movies could do without so much violence, but they have to make money somehow, right?  Last but not least, my readings about, let's say, books and/or music lyrics. So many books have been banned across the United States, because people were offended by them or just didn't want that book on the shelves just in case their child reads it. Some songs can't be played on the radio because of some of the stories behind the music and/or the words in and throughout the song. That's why the artist of the song has to make two different copies of their song, so they can be played and so they will get popular. I have read books that do have some words in them, but they are also my grade level, and I'm pretty sure most people are more mature than they were. When I see a word that isn't the nicest word ever, I keep reading and don't let it bother me. Same with songs, the artist probably has a reason why he/she uses the words they use.  Censorship can be good or bad; it really depends on how you look at things. Honestly, I have no objections to censorship, and other times I do. My experiences, observations, and/or reading have made me think about how censorship could be bad or good, making me realize that it's a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides."
920	3897	2	3	I believe that if you find a book offensive then you should not read that book. What some people find as offensive some other people might find it not offensive. I do not think that people should not be able to take books off of the shelves. For example if there is a person of the Jewish religion they might find a book about Hitler offensive. In that sense if they take the book off of the shelf then the other kids that are soon to come into the age of studying this era will not have a book to look at. Without these books our history of the world will be soon forgotten. These books serve as important reminders of the past, even the parts that are difficult to confront.  Another example would be slavery. I believe that slavery is a hard subject to come to grips with. In reality, it was a hard time for the Africans. I do not think that they will take the books off of the shelf because of it being offensive. To do so would erase a crucial part of history and diminish the suffering endured by countless individuals. How could you take away the future of learning from the children that are our next generation?  If we are to take the books off of the shelves at the libraries what do we do about the Bible? Some people do not believe that there is a God or a heaven, but a lot of other people do believe in it. So how would that work out in the long run? It would create a lot of problems for the public library and for its citizens as well, as diverse viewpoints would be silenced.  In reading books as a kid I have found that some things are bad and I do not like them, but I don't believe that we should take the book away from people that like the books. How do you take away from the people that like to read different novels than you is beyond me, but it will only be a problematic subject in the future, leading to censorship and a limited understanding of the world. Therefore, while personal offense is valid, removing books from shelves hinders education and limits access to diverse perspectives, creating more problems than it solves.
921	3898	2	3	Older authors often delve into grim aspects of their pasts in their writing, whether factual or fictional. Sometimes these books end up discarded or destroyed, while other times parents, upset by their children's behavior, mistakenly blame external influences like television or peers, failing to see the bigger picture. Children can easily access inappropriate content in libraries, often unnoticed by parents until it's too late. Books are diverse, and judging them by their covers is impossible, and while reading is encouraged, not all books are suitable for all ages.  Completely removing books from libraries is unacceptable, regardless of their graphic or inappropriate nature. These books cater to specific interests. Even books about drugs should be available, offering information that might deter experimentation. Books about murder should be accessible, but with age restrictions. Organizing books by age groups could mitigate concerns.  Authors should not be blamed for their work; it reflects their personal thoughts and artistic expression. This principle extends to magazines, music, and movies. Creators should have the freedom to express themselves, and if they deem their work unsuitable for children, they can include age recommendations. If adults are genuinely concerned, reflecting on their own past experiences might offer a different perspective on media content. Ultimately, fostering responsible access and awareness is more effective than censorship, ensuring that while potentially sensitive materials are available, they are also used with discretion and maturity.
922	3899	2	3	Walking in to the library and looking for a good book or magazine to read, you run into some of those disgusting books that are offensive to some people. Some people think they should be removed from the shelves, and I am one of them. Are you? There are some books, magazines, movies, and ect., that we all run into that have very bad language, racism, bad religious talking, and even some about sex. Nobody needs to be reading those kind of books, it is bad for our minds and is very offensive to some people. A lot of people do not like to hear curse words or see them. Seeing those words in a book will make that person think wrong things about the library and put the wrong words in their head. Then there are those books about racism and that is the worst topic to most people. If someone came across that in a book, it would hurt their feelings and they would not want to finish that book. Their are others that are very religious and if they come across something that is wrong about their religion the will be very offended.  There are a few ways that the library could handle the books that offend people. The librarian could think about putting a warning sign up and seperating those books, magazines, and etc., into their own section for people that do get offended by those things know where they are and know not to look there. Or inside the front cover the librarian could put a warning note on there to show the person that there are some things in there that might offend someone. It would be very helpful to so many people!  In every library you won't see that all the books are perfectly good. We all know that there are going to be some bad things in books, but there are some books that are way too inapropriate and those books can be removed. There are just way too many people that get offended while reading the books they want to read. Let's put a stop to it.  In conclusion, many of the libraries around are going to have the kind of books that offend some people. There can be a stop to that by removing them from the shelves or at least warning others about the things in the books, magazines, and all the other entertainment people like these days. It would be amazing to know that all the people that love to read will not be offended by what they are reading, allowing them to enjoy the library and its offerings without fear of encountering upsetting content.
923	3900	2	3	I believe that there are certain movies, music, and other things that are bothering parents. I wouldn't want my kid listening to music that has a lot of things that can teach you whether if it's right or wrong, so I would check the kind of music my child listens to to see if they are being taught bad things. I believe that there are some movies that are too violent for anyone to see, but this is a free country which us regular average people will watch anyway. There are movies made for adults, but how many adults let their kids watch them too? No matter what they make there will be people who don't like what they see or they know somebody who didn't like what they saw. Sometimes there are people that don't like what they hear, or knows somebody who didn't like what they heard in music or on the television. There are times my mom hears something on t.v. or music and says turn that off. My friends all listen to this music that I don't think amounts to anything but the production of inmates, and other wrong doings such as, gangs, fights, shootings, and jury trials. There are things on the market that has an error of a certain group who might like action movies. Well there are kids out there learning those things they saw, and they are trying to do what they saw, because they think that it will make them look cool. There will always be things that people do not like and will never like. I learned that when I was young, just like most young kids have. I think the biggest thing that sells, is the drama, action movies, and the stuff that parents will like. Very little of baby movies, and baby music. But what can you do about that? I like most of what I hear, and see. I have always thought there was a lot of violence, and picture shots, and things about drugs that just should not be on national television to teach the young. This is what I think, and it is likely something that will continue to be debated for years to come.
924	3901	2	3	Human beings, like snowflakes, are very much alike in a unique way. Just as there are no two identical snowflakes, no two humans are exactly the same. As everyone has their differences, there are always those who have a greater sense of curiousity, and prefer to think outside the box. However, it is difficult for these curious people to extend their strive for knowledge, if they have restrictions as to what they can read or study. Therefore, if a person is mature enough, and desires to study or read upon a certain topic at a library, they should be allowed to extend their knowledge on any topic of their choosing, with permission of a gaurdian of course.  Unfortunately, it is often times a group of minorities that ruin something for the greater minority. Libraries often times take in account a child's age as a factor towards what a they can, and can not read, but age seems completely unfair to a child who is mature enough to read, and handle the more adult rated intell in a fashionable manner. If one is legally eligable, and they have permission from their gaurdian, then he or she should have no restrictions to the materials provided at any library what-so-ever. Who is one to say a ten-year-old is too young to learn about Adolf Hitler and his horrible plans for the Third Reich? A person is never too young, or too old to learn something new, if the curiousity and the proper level of maturity is present!  It is curiousity that has led mankind to discover something new each and every day. As well, it is curiousity that has brought mankind to the extraordinary level of technology, and inventions that it is at today. The youth of the present will one day be the engineers, doctors, scientists, and moving leaders of the future. If these young people are curious, and desire to achieve greater knowledge on a certain topic for positive reasons, then let them be! It is essential to foster this intellectual exploration by allowing them access to a wide range of materials, ensuring that their potential contributions to the world are not stifled by unnecessary limitations.
925	3902	2	3	In most libraries in @LOCATION1, there are certain books, movies, music, etc., that could be inappropriate to younger children. These books and movies can contain graphic content or offensive language that any young child should not be hearing or seeing. However, this does not mean that the libraries of @LOCATION2 should get rid of these books, videos, etc. The libraries should keep these books and videos because the adults of @LOCATION2 like to use them, the kids probably already know about the language and graphic content, and some of the books and movies that are offensive are very educational. When you think about your childhood, there would always be things you couldn't watch or listen to because you were too young. Your @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 would watch movies that you couldn't watch because they would say you aren't old enough. They enjoy watching more mature movies because it is more interesting to them than cartoon shows or movies. The mature content in movies, books, and more should be kept in libraries because mature audiences enjoy watching and listening to them. If they are taken out of libraries, this mature audience has nothing to watch or read in the library. They do not want to be reading children's books all the time. Also, most children have already observed or heard this offensive content in these books and movies. Most of the parents in @LOCATION1 have used offensive language in front of their child without even realizing it. The kid then starts using these words because they think they are cool if @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 use them. Another thing is that most kids have seen a movie with graphic content in it, or they have played a video game with it in the game. They have seen blood, gore, and other things in these games and movies. It's already too late to try and hide your child from seeing or hearing these 'bad words' or 'graphic content'. Many movies and books that contain offensive language and graphic content are very good and educational videos. For example, '@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5' was a great movie describing the search for one man in the middle of @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1. These wars actually occurred and movies like this give a great amount of detail on what actually went on during these wars. If you want kids to know about the history of our country, they need to know what actually happened. There is no point in trying to hide the truth. Overall, most kids in @LOCATION1 have heard offensive language or graphic content. Whether it was from a parent or even their best friend, they have heard it. So why would we try to hide this from them? Keep these books, movies, music, and more in the libraries for the benefits of the adults, the kids, and for the history of the country, ensuring access to diverse perspectives and information for everyone.
926	3903	2	3	Taking items such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., will not stop people from getting offended. The questions are who decides what is offensive, and how is it offensive? What makes something offensive? Ultimately, suppressing content will not eliminate offense; instead, a more nuanced approach is required to understand and address the root causes of why certain material is perceived as offensive in the first place.
927	3904	2	3	Many people in the @LOCATION1 community read. Books, magazines, newspapers, and music are a great passing time. I enjoy reading books about people with special powers; such as necromancers. If we were to take such books that offend someone out of our libraries, what would we have left? I, for one, don't like reading @ORGANIZATION1 religious books, which seem to be the only type of book that wouldn't offend someone, unless they have some severe hatred towards letters. Think for a moment about what you like. Think about your interest in music, art, and the style of books or magazines that you read. Now imagine all of those gone from the one place you can get away from screaming children or annoying neighbors: the library. You @MONTH1 may be baffled as to why all of your loves have disappeared. That book you love, the one about necromancers, it's offensive to @CAPS1 Christians because only @CAPS2 God has the power of waking the dead. The song that you have had stuck in your head all day is now no longer online. Its use of certain words are offensive to those with 'sensitive' ears. If I were to walk into a library and find that all the 'offensive' works had been banned, I would be shocked. Everyone in the universe finds certain things offensive. My @CAPS3 English @CAPS4 literature teacher thinks that rap and hip-hop or pop songs are offensive to women and their bodies, but I think that some of those songs hold a different meaning. If everything offensive were to be taken away, what would be left? Nothing that a teenager or an adult would want to read. Heck, @PERSON1 Edgar Allen Poe's works are offensive to some people, they think he was crazy, and who wants their children to read a book written by a buffoon? Also, the less the library contains, the less people go. Libraries would soon close because everything is being found as offensive. All of the books we had hoped to read would have to be bought online, if it were still allowed. For all of the Book @CAPS5 Lovers out there, finding an attention-getting, eye-opening book is like finding buried treasure. It's an event that changes your life, makes your blood rush, and leaves you hanging onto your seat. It's an adventure played in your head, one that you set the specific details of each character, or it's the book that provides the knowledge that feeds your brain every time a new sentence is stored. Taking away everything offensive is like having a child being taken away, you can't replace that love with a distraction, and it will leave a hole in the community's intellectual and emotional life.
928	3905	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. My choice is no. I have several reasons for that. One is that this is a free country and a person has the right to speak on how they feel or what's on their mind. And that should be acceptable anywhere because everyone has their own opinion about what they like or read. And if you feel that it offends you, maybe you shouldn't be reading it or watching it or whatever the case may be. You can find something else to read that you'll enjoy or your friends and family may like. My second reason is that you can learn from stuff that may offend you in any kind of way. Such as this magazine I read about black males sagging their pants. Many white people that saw their pants below their waist had something negative to say about the young men. They only judge a book by its cover because they didn't know nothing about the person that they were talking about, and one of the black males was an honor student in high school that was going to attend a white college. And when many whites started to find out, they began to question the young man about how he dressed and why. He told them this is a free country I can do whatever I like, and whites liked that he spoke up for himself. So with my reasons being said, I find it not right to remove certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. So I hope you enjoyed reading my essay, and I stand firm in my conviction that censorship through removal is not the answer. If you have any arguments or questions you can surely contact me.
929	3906	2	3	No Censorship Do you enjoy reading interesting books, watching superb movies, or listening to appealing music that some people don't approve of? Most people would answer yes to the question because anything that a person reads, watches, or listens to can be found offensive or crude to someone else. Certain materials in libraries should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because different people find different materials offensive, people sometimes specifically come to libraries to search out materials they can't find elsewhere, and if a person finds a material offensive, they don't have to keep reading, watching, or listening to it. The first reason reason why censorship shouldn't occur in libraries is because different people find different materials offensive. Each person is different, and people have all sorts of opinions on books, movies, magazines, music, etc. Also, several different ethnicities exist in the world and many nonfiction books educate people on different cultures around the world. The ethnicity of the people living in the culture might find what the authors of nonfiction books are writing about them offensive because the book is talking about something in their culture they wouldn't want the public hearing about. However, the public needs to be educated on the cultures of different people. Students do research in libraries for research projects and essays. Also, books pertaining to racism such as To Kill A Mockingbird and books about slaves might be offensive to the race that is being victimized in the book. In contrast, some people might love the book because of the a good theme, symbolism, word usage, etc. So, who would be the judge of whether a material is offensive of not? If the person who is doing this for a certain library finds many materials in the library offensive, the whole library could close down because many materials that could have been popular were taken out of the library. Another reason why certain materials shouldn't be removed off shelves if they are found offensive is because sometimes people specifically come to libraries to search out materials they cannot find elsewhere. Libraries are the one place that people go if they are looking for that certain book or maybe even a movie they can't find at a video store. In my experience, there have been an infinite number of times where I have wanted to read a book I have heard about, and I've gone straight to the library and found it there. Also, because no video store exists in the town I live in, I go to the library for movies because I know they have a large selection. Some of the books and movies I or other people like might be found offensive to others, so if they were taken off of library shelves,I'm not sure if I would go to the library as often. A third reason why censorship shouldn't occur in libraries is because people don't have to read what they might find offensive. Everyone has the choice of what materials they acquire from a library, unless it's something they have to read for school. If a person hears about a book that might be found offensive to them, why would they read the book. Also, if a person accidentally checks out a book or watches a movie from the library that they find offensive, they can always just stop reading the book or watching the movie. Censorship shouldn't occur in libraries because everyone has different opinions. Libraries assume that if someone finds a material offensive, they'll just stop reading it. Also, if libraries take out all the materials anyone finds offensive, what will be left to read, watch, or listen to? By allowing a diverse collection, libraries ensure access to a wide range of perspectives and ideas, fostering intellectual growth and critical thinking within the community.
930	3907	2	3	I do not think that any books should be taken out of libraries because they are found 'offensive'. Something that is offensive to me may not be offensive to another. Although I have all the right in the world to object to a book that I find inappropriate, somebody else might believe that that book is completely appropriate. The main issues that most people have with books are foul language, sex, and difference in opinion. These three categories are very sensitive issues, some may not be comfortable discussing these issues. Many books in the library systems today contain foul language. Surprising enough a majority of the indecent language can be found in the young adult section. I don't believe that parents would be very happy to know what their children are reading. In our modern day world we are bombarded with images of sex and indecency. Books containing obscure acts are no different from television or magazines. Most romance novels are very descriptive and leave little room for imagination, and in the wrong hands can lead to some very prompting questions. Difference in opinion can be a big problem for some libraries if patrons do not like the message a book sends. Religion, politics, and morals can lead to some nasty debates, but sometimes we have to just agree to disagree. Can teenagers handle that kind of language and sexuality in a responsible way? Should the books be taken off the shelf just on the basis that we don''t agree with what it says? Should there be a sensor on what can and can't be put in libraries? I dont think that any books should be taken off of library shelves. If you don't agree with the book then don't read it. Instead of blaming libraries for what your children read, perhaps you should look at your own parenting and make sure they aren't reading something they shouldn't. Ultimately, we must respect the freedom to read and access information, even if we find some content disagreeable.
931	3908	2	3	'@CAPS1 - @CAPS2 or No?' Katherine Paterson's quote about offensive books is completely true, and I @PERCENT1 agree with her. She's saying that if everyone had the right to remove a book they found offensive off of every shelf, there would be no more books for people in the world. There are most likely books that one person could find offensive, but others do not. What would the world have left if almost all books are taken off the shelf? I do not think that offensive materials such as books should be removed from shelves because not everybody could find them offensive and could be depriving people of their favorite subjects, I've had my own experience with a supposedly offensive book, and because there would not be books left in the world. There are books about every single subject in the world. Some are about subjects we love and could read about for days. Others are about subjects that we hate or that just plain bore us. Though whatever the subject is, whether it be about the media, science fiction, romance, or anything else, there are different people in the world who love reading about different subjects. If a person had the right to remove a certain type of book from libraries and stores, say a romance book, because she found it offensive in some way and it was taken off the shelves, then a person who loved reading that book would be deprived from it because one person found it offensive. Just because on person finds a book offensive, doesn't mean everyone else in the world would too. I've had my own experience with a supposedly offensive book. In my @CAPS3 class, we were assigned to read 'The @CAPS4 in the @CAPS5'. As we were reading the book I honestly thought it was a very interesting story. Though later with some research I found out that the book was banned in alot of schools all over the @LOCATION1. Teachers from those schools reported that there were some very subjective words and events in the book. I do agree that there was some bad language, but I don't think that's a reason to ban the book from schools. It's an awesome story that won a couple awards, and my class also enjoyed it. My experience with this proved another point that certain books should not be banned. Just as @PERSON1 stated, if every person was given a right to ban certain books from libraries, there wouldn't be books left in the world for people to read. There are millions of people in the world. If every single person was able to ban one book in the @LOCATION1, what would we have left? There would probably be nothing left. If every book was gone from the @LOCATION1, what would kids in school be able to read? Kids would start reading at a slower rate, causing grades to drop. One little law change in @CAPS1 could cause great negative changes in the future. There's always going to be people in the world who find certain books offensive. That's never going to change, but people also have the freedom and choice to stay away from the book they abhor. Unless you're a student in school, you don't have to read or look at a book you find offensive, and you can also try to keep your kids from reading whatever it is because if you want one book banned off of shelves, your depriving other people of books. So I say every library stays the way they are now, and keep every book they have for all kids and adults, allowing everyone to have access to the stories and knowledge they seek.
932	3909	2	3	I would not let someone ban my favorite movie, just because it has mildly offensive materials in it. If everyone had the right to ban books then we would have no books, because something would offend someone. You should not ban books because it desecrates our individuality, we have the freedom of press, and because it would ruin the future.  If you ban a book then you are giving up your individuality. Letting someone decide what is offensive limits your self-expression. Therefore, by letting someone else decide what is appropriate for you to read, you are giving up your freedom of thought. By banning books, you are not being yourself; you are conforming to what other people want. Therefore, you should not ban books because it demolishes your individuality and makes you conform to what other people want.  There should not be any banning of books. You should not be able to ban books because we have the freedom of press, a cornerstone of a free society. The freedom of press means that we can write whatever we want. However, you should not ban books because we have the freedom to choose what we read. This means that we as individuals should be able to decide what we want to read and what we do not. You should not ban books because we have the freedom of press and because we have the freedom as individuals to read what we want.  If you ban books then you will ruin the future. There are hundreds of really phenomenal books out there that would be banned, and future people would not be able to enjoy them. There are books that can change your life and teach you how to deal with things, and if we ban them then we are ruining the chance to help future people with their problems. People turn to books for knowledge, help, and ideas, and if we take away their books then how can we say that we are paving the way for the future if we are destroying it along the way? Books should not be banned because if they were, we would be ruining the future for others, and we would be destroying our own future.  In conclusion, books should not be banned because it limits our individuality, we have the freedom of press, and because it destroys our future. If you ban books, more likely than not, your favorite book would get banned. Also, if everyone could ban books, then there would be nothing to read because all of the books would be banned. By banning books, you are destroying the future, limiting our freedoms, and abolishing our individuality, and for these reasons, we must protect the freedom to read.
933	3910	2	3	I don't think that books, music, magazines, movies should be removed from a library's shelf. A library should carry every kind of book, movie, magazines, music etc. The reason that a library should carry everything is because, say, a farmer wants to come in and get a book over cattle and some city person says that it's no use and throws it away, the farmer is out of luck, or say the opposite would happen. Another reason would be a person's tastes; some people like romance, and some like action etc., so if they don't carry one type, someone will get mad about it and stop going. Say if @PERSON2 does not like violence, so they take it off the shelf, and @PERSON1 don't like chick flicks etc., what would that leave in a library? No one would have anything to read, and they would close the library down because there would only be a few books. The movies and magazines, I would say carry anything that was appropriate, and if it was rated @CAPS1, you had to be @NUM1 to rent it; then the person would be an adult. There are different cultures out there that only like certain things, so what are they going to do, make separate libraries so that each culture will be happy, or just build one big library, and the ones that don't like just leave the book or whatever there. Ultimately, it's up to the parent to teach their child not to pick up the bad items if they're not liked by a certain family or culture. If they would get rid of the stuff one person didn't like, it would lose customers and make others mad, so in my eyes, it's better to have one person mad because a library carries a certain type of item than to lose customers and make @NUM2 people mad, or even two, to make one person happy when it is as simple as don't pick it up. So, ultimately, we cannot make everyone happy, so just look over the items you do not like, teach your children not to bring them home, and move on in life and don't start a problem, because censorship based on individual preferences would ultimately diminish the library's value and accessibility for all.
934	3911	2	3	I think that none of the books should be removed from the shelves of libraries. I think that everyone should have a chance of reading any book they want to. Just because a person or few people don't like it doesn't mean remove it. They don't have to read that book. If I did like a book i just don't like it. everyone has their own choice of what kind of stories they are into. Like im in to freaky novels. Everyone I hangout with is not in to freaky novels. In I mite not be into what they are into. Like I dislike a lot of love stories not them all just a few of them I don't like. I can say I am in to abnormal stories. I like fiction stories then nonfiction. My most favorite novels is 'The Hunger Games'. Most people would want to remove the stories with bad language or vocabulary off the shelves. I know a lot of people that are into those kind of stories. I think that would be unfair to do that. Why take away what they like in not what you like. Like I am into all kind of sex books. Some people wouldn't want those books on the shelves either. Just by removing someones type of book could make people don't want to read anymore. I know it would make me stop reading if I can't read what I want to read. Now think to yourself would you risk taking away someones favorite book. In the results of them not reading anymore. If you do theirs something wrong with you. How would you feel if that was to happen to you. So you all way pose to look at it in anothers persons point of view. You should look at all the positive way first. Like how happy dose that makes that person that reads the books. Not only would it effect the read but the person who wrote the book. You will be doing a lot of damage to a lot of people. You would be putting someone out their job. You could mess up someones family of living. You could take away somones beliefs. You can make what they thought was a good thing into something bad. You can drive a person crazy. You can make what that person stand for meaning nothing at all. Books could be a way people escape the real world. Reading books could give people more things to talk about. Books can be a way of learning how to deal with thing in a better way. I suggest that people should just leave the books wear they are at. Books are way people express how they feel, they life style, and what they been threw etc....... Life is hard in books makes it eaiser for some people, and removing them would create unnecessary harm for both readers and authors alike.
935	3912	2	3	No criteria such as books, school textbooks, magazines, etc. should be removed from shelves just because they are found offensive. The United States is a free country, which means that if you find something offensive such as a book or magazine, you don't have to read it. When people get all upset over a book or movie they saw it really drives me crazy, simply because you don't have to go see that movie, or go read that book. Different people find different things offensive, this can be because of race, gender, ethnicity, etc. So we shouldn't start removing materials from shelves just because a few people find it offensive. Some people think it is offensive that proffessional athletes get paid millions of dollars for playing a game, when there are homeless people living on the street. Never the less the Super Bowl is the most watched event in the world when it comes on. Just because a few people think sports are offensive doesn't mean they should be shut down for good. Another example is racial jokes, some people think they are funny when others find them very offensive. This still isn't going to stop people from telling racial jokes. Just as Katherine Paterson said, no criteria should be removed from the shelves in the library just because some people find it offensive. People do not find the same things offensive, so taking material off the shelves would not be the right way to deal with this issue. If you find something offensive then just dont pursue it. Almost every single book in the worls has something in it that someone, somewhere finds offensive. If we took all of these books off the shelves, there would be nothing left to read. This is a free country, which means you have the right to choose whether to read or pursue something or not. So instead choosing to eliminate books from the library, just dont read them, because maybe somebody doesn't find the same things offensive as you do, and they might like to read that book. Therefore, maintaining a diverse collection, even with potentially offensive content, is crucial for upholding freedom of choice and catering to varied perspectives.
936	3913	2	3	I think all books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The reason I say this is because what if there are little children that are willing to read grown-up books, and it's all types of naked pictures and words that are not in a child's vocabulary? Then they will pick up bad habits and use them without knowing what the words actually mean. Then, I think music should be edited because some music has cursing and talks about things that a young-minded child or children shouldn't hear. The music should only be something children are supposed to listen to, things that are in their age group. Next, I believe movies should be censored because nowadays we are letting our children watch everything and anything they want. Things that don't control their language such as certain inappropriate content. I believe that a specific show needs to be blocked because they really do and say explicit things on that show, and a lot of children watch and repeat everything they hear and see on that show. Finally, magazines... I say the same goes for magazines because they have naked girls and men on the covers and pages of these magazines that show just way too much, and they put things in the magazines to make them look real when they are actually not. I think that internet access should only be used when needed to research and do homework because children use the internet to watch explicit things and listen to such bad things. In conclusion, all together, I think there should be a limit to everything we listen to and watch, because children pick up everything they hear and see, and limiting exposure to offensive or inappropriate material is crucial for their healthy development.
937	3914	2	3	I don't think they should remove anything that's offensive from the library cause honestly, most of the books authors publish have something offensive in them. It's not the library's fault; if there are children reading these books that are offensive, then that's the parents' fault for letting them read them. I've been to the library and listened to music, watched movies, and even read magazines that have some offensive content in them, but if they were to remove all the offensive content from the library, then the library would be half empty. I've seen parents discussing with the librarians about banning content that's not appropriate from the library, but why would it even matter if they can just ignore it and keep it away? It honestly isn't a big deal when it comes to these type of problems. I discussed this with my mom once, and she completely agrees with me. My mom said it wouldn't be a problem as of today if they could have just ignored it. Also, the music that they have should stay there, whether or not it's offensive, cause people like to express themselves with the music that they listen to. The movies that are made these days all have inappropriate content in them, whether it's a rated R movie or not. As of all the argument going on about libraries having offensive content, it should still be kept at the library and not removed. I'm sure a lot of teens and adults enjoy all the content that's kept at the library. If children end up listening to the offensive music, or watching offensive movies, then think about it like this, they need to grow up someday. If that's not the case, then parents should keep them away from the content, as censorship shouldn't be the default solution for potentially offensive material.
938	3915	2	3	Certain material such as books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from libraries. The quote by Katherine Paterson simply states that if everyone had the right to remove a book from a shelf, then we would have no books left on the shelf for any of us. The world would be empty because there is always something that a person sees as offensive. To each person that finds the material offensive, there are always ten people who do not find it offensive at all. A person's beliefs can cloud their views on things like religion or politics, influencing what they deem acceptable. There are so many wrong things out in the world that you can never do right by everyone's standards.  In places like libraries, you never know who might come in to check something out. That is why it is recommended to make sections in the library, employing a system of organization. Adult novels, children's books, science fiction novels all in different sections of the library, with clear signage. This would make a parent cautious of where their child goes, encouraging responsible supervision. If a child walks into the wrong sections, there is only one person to blame; the parent. Children always wander off into random places because of curiosity. Parents have to make sure that nothing horrific happens such seeing something that a toddler or a teenager is not supposed to see.  One object, such as a book, a movie, or a magazine, can teach a person millions of lessons. If those lessons are not taught yet, they will be taught later, perhaps through experience. In a harder way, potentially facing real-world consequences. The person might have to live the lesson to learn it. That is why some material should not be taken away.  Everyone believes in different things. There is always someone that has a different opinion of things. The world contains of many things that people find offensive, but it does not mean those things have to go. There is always a choice of what to do and what not to do. Someone has to find a way to fix things and in a good kind of way where people can find peace with themselves and others. Removing material from libraries can cause many things; approval, disapproval, anger, and happiness. Most of all, it can cause fights, which later on can turn into war. The material in our libraries is meant to teach people about life, and people find that wrong, then it means they do not experience life, highlighting the importance of exposure to diverse perspectives and the freedom to learn from them.
939	3916	2	3	Censorship is not an easy question to answer; it involves a great deal of thought. When thinking about a topic like this you must look at a greater picture. You should think about after math like thoughts and opinions from everyone else. When it comes to censorship in libraries I feel that all the books should be left on the selves. So, why would we take books away from people who want to read them just so that others don't? If you don't want a child to look at adult books, then you can censor them by watching them, and not taking them to places that have such books. This way other people can read these books. If you truly think about it, then you will realize that if you are trying to keep something from a teen they can, and will, find a way of getting it. If you are trying to keep things from them that will only make them want it more. Books are good for people. It tells them stories that cannot happen, past events they did not live through, and even the thoughts of others. Keeping books away from people is not good for them; they would not be able to learn from the things they read. So, maybe some books are more racie than others, that does not mean you should hide it from your children; instead, use these books as learning tools. If you were to start censoring books in libraries it could cause some problems. Now you will have no books for some people. You will have taken most books out of libraries because one person thinks it is not good for the children. This will cause arguments over what should and shouldn't be in the library, and people will stop going to the library all together, thus defeating the purpose of a library. So, when you think about banning books just remember that there are other places to get books. Books are good for people especially teens, whose minds are developing. In some places books that are banned to other places are celebrated. When trying to get rid of books just think about the people you are taking them away from; ultimately, the free exchange of ideas is vital for a healthy society.
940	3917	2	3	I strongly agree that we should remove offensive books, magazines, and music from library shelves. Libraries are meant to be safe havens for readers, listeners, and learners. When I was younger, the library was my favorite place. I eagerly anticipated each visit, excited to discover new stories and ideas. However, that excitement diminished after encountering some disturbing content. While I can't recall the specific titles, I remember feeling confused and upset by the offensive language and themes. This could easily happen to other children, and libraries should prioritize providing positive and enriching materials. After my negative experience, I tried to ignore it, hoping it would fade away. Offensive materials should be permanently removed from libraries. As a book lover, I simply want to find enjoyable and appropriate books in a welcoming library environment. Offensive content has no place in libraries; children should be able to immerse themselves in stories and music without encountering harmful material. In closing, I firmly believe that offensive books, music, and magazines should be removed. Imagine if your sister, daughter, or niece encountered such material at the library; how would you feel? It's crucial to create safe and positive library experiences for everyone.
941	3918	2	3	When I was in fifth grade, chaos broke out in my community. Everyone-- teachers, students, parents, school board members, community leaders-- had something to say about the topic at hand. This topic was censorship. A high schooler's parents were outraged that their daughter had read The Bluest Eye in class. In these parents' opinion, the rape scene in the book was far too disturbing for their precious daughter. While this seemed a fair stance to take, the parents then took things a step further. They sought to ban the book in the schools in our township, wanting to spare all other children the experience of being exposed to what was clearly traumatic material. This crusade of theirs posed the questions 'what can and should be censored? And when?'. As the debate continued, I myself begin to ponder the subject. Who had the right to tell me what I could read? Or listen to? Or watch? The answer I came to was 'no one'. No one has the right to censor anyone else. This comes with one exception: parents and children. Parents have the responsibility to monitor their children. They must use their best judgement to decide what their children are old enough and mature enough to hear, see, or read. This was true in the censorship of The Bluest Eye, as well. No one fought back against the family because they did not want their own child to read the novel; it was only once they tried to keep others from the book that the problem arose. This is why libraries should not remove materials from their shelves because they are, in the eyes of some, offensive materials. Music you love might be offensive to me. Books your English teacher assigned might not be appropriate for five year olds. Your friends might be offended by your favorite movie or stand-up show. These feelings are subjective; almost nothing is universally offensive or universally appropriate. We must, as a society, be able to accept this. We learn through what we see, what we hear, and what we read. These experiences teach us what to do, as well as teach us what not to do. Because of this, it would be unfair for materials to be removed from libraries based on solely opinions. To do that would be to steal from community members their chance to learn. Parents have the right to censor what their children see, hear, and read, but even this censorship must be done carefully in order to not hinder the child's ability to learn. We must not hinder our children's ability to learn from the mistakes of book and movie characters, singers, comedians, and artists. If we do take away that ability, we are setting these future adults up for making mistakes that could have been prevented by allowing them the chance to learn. Removing materials from the shelves of libraries based solely on opinions is not only damaging to our society, but, ultimately, it is dangerous to the people we wish to protect.
942	3919	2	3	Libraries are a source of information. They provide us with valuable research, entertainment, and cold hard facts. Therefore, I do not believe that libraries should have to censor the books that are supplied for the citizens to check out. Everyone is faced with choices in life. Some are more difficult than others and will have a greater impact on your life. We decide if we want to wear the black shirt or the grey shirt, the blue shorts or the brown shorts. Everyday we have choices. We also have choices at a library. If we see a book with a title that sounds like it might be offensive, then we should just walk past it. Most libraries are organized and the book sections are clearly stated. Common sense would tell us that this section might contain offensive material. We have the choice on whether or not we check out a book that might offend us or not. If it does offend us, then it's our own fault. The second reason libraries should not censor what books they provide goes right along with the choices we make in life. No one forces us to check out this book or that book. It's a choice. No one puts a gun to our head and says, 'Read this book or you will die.' It just doesn't happen like that. No one forces us to read something we don't want to. It's all up to you and how you feel about the book. Different subjects offend different people. I'm not offended by a curse word here or there, however; I am offended by sex related instances that often occur in movies or books. I make my own choice to not watch or read those kinds of materials. Since everyone is different, the sex related instances might not offend another group of people and they might see it as perfectly fine to watch or read. Different subjects offend different people and taking away a book or movie because it offends one person should not happen. If libraries were to start censoring what materials they put on the shelf, I believe many people would be upset. Who would decide what is offensive and not offensive? It would upset too many customers and the use of libraries would probably dwindle. When you are in charge of censoring what goes on the shelf many problems come into play. Do you count different religions offensive because they blaspheme another religion's god? Do you count a certain work of fiction offensive because it contains one curse word in the whole book? There is no way to properly censor all your books without upsetting customers. I'm not saying that libraries should be allowed to show every magazine known to man. Some are obviously worse than others; but, when it comes to books and movies, the people know what they are checking out and know what they will find offensive. There are too many people in this world to try and censor the materials libraries display, therefore libraries should trust their patrons to make informed decisions and not censor the materials they display.
943	3920	2	3	Certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should never be removed just because a certain person, or group of people, find it offensive. The authors of these books have the right, as stated in the @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, to have the freedom to say what they wish within the context of their own individual writing. Also, certain materials that some people find offensive have little to no offensiveness to many other people who @MONTH1 enjoy the book or movie. Finally, many books that are on the shelves of many of our libraries have no end to the amount of things that @MONTH1 be considered offensive, but allow a certain knowledge to be had by, not only the writer, but the reader as well. If something is stated in such an important document as the @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, one that set the standard for living and set the laws of a nation to parchment, than it should, for lack of a better term, be taken with the utmost respect and dignity. Several great leaders, such as the first president of the @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2, decided that freedom of the press was a viable asset to a new and growing country. This simple fact alone should hold more than enough levity to allow all materials, no matter how offensive, to not only be published, but also enjoyed by all people. It is this simple freedom that causes books to be published, even written, no matter how offensive they @MONTH1 be. Certain materials that a person, or group of people, find offensive @MONTH1 not be offensive to everyone. No matter what religion, ethnicity, or moral values you hold, just because it is offensive to you does not mean that it is offensive to everyone. Many people in this world serve in their nation's military, ones used to fight more battles than any history book could hold, is just one example that not everyone in this world holds the same morals or ideas that others do, and tensions will always arise because of it. That being said, this also holds true to the way certain people perceive literature and art. @ORGANIZATION3 would hate @ORGANIZATION2's art, and @ORGANIZATION2 would hate @ORGANIZATION3's, however, neither has the right to condone it or to keep it from the eyes of the world. Many times literature gets removed before their true meaning can be shown to anyone. This is disheartening for several reasons, one being that whatever we, as a human race, could've learned from this piece is now lost forever. Many books could teach the older generations how to leave a legacy for generations to come. Others @MONTH1 teach how future generations can change the world by simply working hard and doing their best. These are best portrayed in books that are sometimes removed from the shelves because of hard lessons or graphic words used. Is censorship in libraries ok? No. Not at all. All works of literature should be allowed to be read and enjoyed, not only by the author, but also by the young, the old, and all ages in between, of all races and religions. The longer we allow materials to be removed from the shelves of our libraries, the less of a chance we are giving, not only ourselves, but future generations to learn and be all that they can possibly be, and to truly flourish in a world of free thought and expression.
944	3921	2	3	There are many different styles of literature and media in this world. With this variety, it has to please at least one person. If not, why was it made? There comes a point when things just become too much. Some media and literature has passed this point and it should not be allowed on shelves.  Media is a huge influence in todays society. What would you do without it? Everyday, everyone is using media related, whether it is turning on the television in the morning and watching the 'Good Morning America' to opening up a magazine and reading about what famous person is in jail this time. You cannot get away from it. Teens especially are truely addicted for the most part. We have video games, online chats (facebook and myspace), and movies. Many things we learn from these are not good for our minds and health. Some video games are good to play but when you become wrapped up in them, playing non stop, killing people and laughing at this, here you know there is something wrong. Our minds are exposed to so much immorality and violence, so we think it is okay to do. Many people see it as, the movie stars do it, so why can't we? Today's society is killing our minds and many young people who think their life is miserable just go out and commit suicide.  Music can get too extensive as well. Yes, you have you oldies, country, and the jazz but when you add in the rap and heavy metal music, there is no understanding. Rap is all about who am I going to sleep with next and how many times I can have sex. Really, is this what our lives should be focused on? I didnt know people like the thought of a whore. Heavy metal music, you cannot understand it, but when you research the words you see that life is useless and why are we living? People say that this music helps them calm their anger down. Feeling realived after they have listen to it. You may be clam now but after hearing these words and banging your head around, what is going to happen when you do get extrememly mad?  Too many lives are effect by today's media and literature. Lives of friends have been lost and friendships have been ruined. Someone is always going to say a certain amount is too much, but I think we need to set a goal of how much is too much and try to save ourselves. We are not like a video game that has seconds lives. We need to be more mindful of the content we consume and its potential impact on our well-being, for the sake of our lives and relationships.
945	3922	2	3	Books, music, movies and magazines are all offensive in different ways. They all are some how offensive to people if they have inappropriate language or actions or stories in them. Should these materials be taken off the shelf just because some people think they are too offensive to be on there and they don't want their children getting ahold of them? When I go to the library I see different sections, fiction, nonfiction, etc. What I don't see is a section marked 'offensive'. Libraries don't do that. If parents or anyone don't want their children or any other children reading offensive books they should go with them and make sure they don't pick up offensive books, or have them wait in the childrens area. Libraries usually don't carry offensive music. They have audiobooks for books to listen to. That might have offensive language in it. Before renting or buying the audiobook you should ask someone who works at the library to tell you if they consider it offensive or not. If they don't know then don't get the audiobook. Most of the time you know what you're looking for before you go to the library anyways. If movies are offensive they are marked rated R. G movies are the better ones. If parents or anyone do not want their children watching rated R movies before renting or buying one they should check the back where it always tells you. When I was young my mom would always check the back of movies because she didn't want me watching rated R movies. She herself thought most of them were too offensive for me to see. Most of the time magazines don't have offensive language in it but they sometimes have inappropriate pictures of men and women. They also have a bunch of gossip stories you might not want your children to read. But if you're letting your children read this then you should read it before they do to make sure for yourself there is nothing you wouldn't want them reading. I don't think there is any reason to remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc., from the shelves if they are offensive to some. If a parent or anyone else doesn't want their children or anyone else's children to read something they think is offensive they should make sure they read something before they let them read it. Also walk around with the child in the library to make sure they don't pick up anything they wouldn't like, or have their child pick things from the childrens section. Some people like reading books, magazines some might think are offensive. Everyone shouldn't be punished for those who just don't want their children finding offensive things in the library, and the responsibility ultimately lies with the individual or parent to make informed choices about what they consume.
946	3923	2	3	Books, movies, magazines, or music that is offensive in any way should not be allowed to be shown to the public. If these offensive things were not allowed to be shown I personally think it would help our country, which is full of racist people and documents. Every time you pick up a magazine or you watch a television show about a famous actress or musician you see embarrassing aspects of their lives all over the world. This is not right at all! People should be shown respect and allowed to have some privacy in their life. If it wasn't for actresses and musicians we wouldn't have any television shows to watch. There would be no use to have radios. There would be no reason to; there would be nobody to sing songs for us. Why would we want to embarrass these guys anyways? They work their tails off to produce new things for us.  Books in the libraries should not have sexual assaults in them at all. Books like this in school libraries have no reason to be there. Why would you want your child to read something like that out of a book in the school? Especially foul language in materials at school. Books at the library should have good examples in them not vulgar sayings. This is a disgrace to the school and goes against the values we try to instill.  Movies are a big concern. Any child or young adult could go into the movie section and get any type of movie even if it is rated restricted. Would you want your child bringing home a movie that had nudity in the film? I remember one time my little sister brought home a movie from our local library. This movie was a total disgrace to this library; it had nudity, foul language, and lots of violence. I couldn't believe what I had just saw. My library would have something like this in the library? Children go there and pick movies out. My mother had went in and made a complaint about the restricted movies being in with the children films. She said that the movies should be separate from the rest. You should have to be a certain age to rent this movie, or at least have a parent's permission. Clear guidelines for age-appropriate content are essential for responsible media consumption.  Every local library or school library should be taking action in doing this for their community. Let's keep our children and young adults away from violence. By allowing this in our school libraries and local libraries it is just saying it's okay to letting this violence in. We should put a stop to it and promote good attitudes, ensuring a healthier and more positive environment for our youth. So please take the violence off the shelves and prioritize responsible content selection.
947	3924	2	3	Are some materials, such as books, movies, magazines should be removed from the shelves if those things are found offensive? There are some things in books are movies that are offensive, and that other younger adults shouldn't watch or read. Reading a book also says a lot about certain topics that are offensive. But at the same time can you learn from these things such as finding it in a book or seeing it on tv. So I don't think that certain things that are found offensive should be taken off the shelves, because people should learn off of these things. Some people have a hard time understanding what's right and wrong in life, because they're not getting the full effect in life and what it is meant. The problem I think is people might not think certain things are offensive because they might not know what it means. Movies on the other hand has a different side of the fence. Movies can affect someone, especially someone who is very young. Those children can look what's on tv and copy exactly what they are doing. They also can be a role model which is not always good for some people. Another thing is that music plays a big role in someone's life because there is sad music, loving music and also violent music. Music can define a person. For example if you are listening to a sad song, you might feel sad or depressed. Or a person listening to hard and violent music might feel upset or angry. Certain music that people listen to can define who they are. Especially when I had said it determines what kind of a mood you are in. I think when people listen to the music he or she likes, it defines who they are, it shows what kind of mood there are in. Secondly, magazines are an advertisement. It shows everything, it tells you stories. Just like in the movies if you see it, you're going to do it. But magazines are different, they show like the styles, and life stories of others. When you see things you might want to do things just as the what the magazine. Usually when you look in a magazine you usually see pictures so it's not as big of effect as the others such as the music and movies. They more likely describe things. Books on the other hand are similar. You can learn what's in a book just by reading it. So if a person might read something about violence he or she might think it is right to do so. Even if that particular book is telling you what's right about the topic. So no I don't think that some books that are found offensive because only that person or individual can learn what being offensive is. So keeping these types of books might help other people who are readers. Ultimately, exposure to diverse perspectives, even those considered offensive, can foster critical thinking and a deeper understanding of the world around us, making censorship counterproductive to individual growth and societal progress.
948	3925	2	3	@LOCATION1's main idea in the area of art, language, and music is freedom. Freedom is to write what we want, draw what we want, and say what we want, and in all, to express ourselves freely as a person. It is one of the amendments in the 'Bill of Rights of @CAPS2', known as freedom of speech.  Saying that, I believe that we should not be able to ban, censor, or remove any books, music, or movies from the United States public. It is their right as a United States citizen to buy what they want. It takes away rights from people, and when they do that, it makes citizens feel like toddlers. They can't choose for themselves what to see and what not to see.  Everything in this world can be offensive to somebody. Just because that one person finds something bad or distasteful, doesn't mean that they have to make everyone else stop seeing it. That's what gives the world its varieties. What someone might think is weird, somebody else might think is normal. When that happens, why is it okay to take away what makes that person feel normal? Just to make the other person feel better?  I walked into the store once before wanting to buy a videogame. I found one I thought looked cool, took it off the shelf, and brought it up to the cashier. He took one look at the game, saw the rating for it, and said that I had to have an adult with me to purchase the game. I went on about how my dad would not care if I bought this game. The cashier said it didn't matter and that I still had to have him here. Then I had to search throughout the store looking for my dad so that he could walk back to the cashier to buy the game for me. What difference did it make? In the end I got the game anyway.  That experience I had at the store that day let me know how it felt to have my wanting of something be shot down. It made me feel like a baby that needed permission to do something. It also helps me know how the writers, artists, and movie directors feel when they get their work censored, rejected, or banned because somebody somewhere found it offensive.  We need to let people express how they feel. If we didn't then a lot of the stuff today would be different. @PERSON1 had the idea of the world not being flat and that he could sail all the way around the world without falling off of it. Everybody thought he was crazy and got angry at his thinking. But he did it, and proved himself right.  Galilaue scientist thought came up with the theory that the sun did not revolve around the Earth. He started doing experiments and tried to prove his theory. The people of where he did his work got engraged and through him into exile and imprisoned him. After that somebody thought that it was a good idea, he experimented on it, and the people supported him. Now we have that theory as a fact, that the sun doesn't revolve around the Earth.  That is what makes freedom of speech so important to the world; it makes people think in different ways and helps people think of new ideas. Freedom, therefore, is the key to any way of living, opening doors to innovation and progress.
949	3926	2	3	There are a lot of things that you can find in libraries that some people might find inappropriate, while others don't. If something offends me, I would ask them to remove it from the shelf. If you have a project, go to the library to meet friends and work on it. If you need help finding a book for your project, ask the librarian where to find it. The library helps those without a home computer, allowing them to do their work there. If more books were available on discs, DVDs, movies, or tape players, more people might read. If all libraries had the same books, more people would visit to get the books they want. If little kids want to read kids' books, there should be a dedicated section. All libraries should remove inappropriate books that some people find offensive, preventing complaints about the material. There are probably about @NUM1 to @NUM2 libraries in @LOCATION1. I know for a fact that there is something inappropriate on the shelves in all the libraries. With tons of books, there's a good chance someone will find something they dislike and ask for its removal. If enough people complain, it should be taken off the shelf. There are also many magazines, some unsuitable for little kids. If they contain content about drugs or other sensitive topics, they could be offensive. All magazines should have a rating system. You would have to be older than @NUM3 years of age to get a pg-@NUM3 mag. Some magazines should cater to both kids and adults, divided into separate sections. They need to respect all library patrons. I think there's some of that here in our hometown, but I'm not @PERCENT1 positive. We all have the right to request the removal of offensive material, and the library could face consequences if they refuse; libraries need to be more considerate of their content to better serve the community.
950	3927	2	3	Dear newspaper editor, I am writing to tell you about the censorship in the libraries of Anytown. This doesn't seem like a big problem to some, but a very major problem for others. Censorship has removed books, music, magazines, movies, and other things, from the shelves of local stores and libraries for being offensive to the seller or workers. It's not what some store owners or library owners like in some cases, but it's not about what they like. It's about the people in general that have a certain interest towards that subject. Some people have even removed the Bible from local library systems. Does it even matter what the owner wants to sell? In most cases, no. The belief in a religion or even a book, magazine, or movie that had one small comment about; sex, drugs or alcohol is removed for just that. If we remove everything about any of that, the only thing left would be children's books. Some people would find ways to get those censored as well. We would become illiterate without books, magazines and other things of that nature. There's even an account of a person being fired from their job for reading a magazine on their break at work! What happens if we all listen to another person that wishes to remove a book off the shelf? Then another and another, we would have no books in our libraries or stores. This censorship is a major problem, very few people really care about this subject. Most think it should be done to most items, some think we don't need to censor anything, as we are a free country. So newspaper editor, please question yourself, ask yourself, would I like to have all of my favorite magazines, books, and movies gone forever, never to be seen again? Then everyone will know the answer, and hopefully start to value the freedom to read and access information.
951	3928	2	3	Some books on the shelf at libraries have bad things in it, whether it is what the book is about, the curse words in them, or just not very approprit for some of the age groups. Should the books at the libraries be censored or should we just leave them for the reader to decide if they want to read it or not? I dont think any of the books, or magazines should be censered. If some one wants to read a book with curse words in it or anything like that then let them. The parents might not let some kids read them but some parents just dont care. I think if they read them they might say them but they will learn not to say them and that they are not very nice to say. Should the movies you get at libraries be censered? I dont think they should because the parents arent going to let them get it or watch the movie if they dont think it is something they need to be watching. The kids know what they can and cant watch so if it is something they know they cant watch then they shouldnt get it. The kids might get it but the parents could take it away and tell them they cant watch it. Should all books,magazines, music, or movies from libraries be censered? No. If it is a library at school everything has to be school approprit. If the book, movie, magazine, or music is not approprit they the school cant lone it out. A public library can but there are mostly adults there. The kids should know what they can and cant watch, read, or listen to, so they should know better than to get something they cant read, watch, listen to, or look at. Some parents might agree to censering them but if you do that you are limiting the books everyone can read. Even the parents or adults wouldnt be able to read them as well, so censorship across the board is not the right way to go.
952	3929	2	3	What do you think about Books? Do you think it matters how appropriate they are? Well im going to tell you my oppinion on the books that should and shouldn't be in libraries. I think that there are many different few from many different people on books. Someone just cant say that they think a book shouldn't be in a library period. I think that if maybe it is a inappropriate book from someone in grade school to read then it should be in the high school or a public library. I can see that some parents @MONTH1 not want to have their kid reading it but i think that they are going to hear a lot worse and see worse than a book is going to have. I can also see where parents are coming from when they say that they dont want there child reading that kind of book. I belive that if a kid wants to read it than they are going to read it, parents shouldn't be so up tight on what there kids read. I know that they want to protect their kid from seeing that stuff but its going to happen one day so they might as well get used to it. Also a grade school shouldn't even have a book that would be considered inappropriate to a student in there library, or should have a parent sign somethign saying that they are ok with it. So inconclusion thats what I say if parents have a problem with it than they should discuss it with the school. They should just go in and talk to the librarian and tell them that they dont want their child to check out such books. All a parent would have to do is go in to the school or where ever their child is getting the book and tell them that and it would solve all problems. So, ultimately, communication and age-appropriateness are key to addressing concerns about books in libraries, ensuring that young people have access to a wide range of literature while respecting parental guidance.
953	3930	2	3	To censor, or not to censor? That is the question. I am positive that there are a great amount of different views portaining to this topic. Everyone will have very good points on either using, or not using censorship in the library. Although this is true, I believe that there are many more valid reasons not to use censorship in libraries. First of all, how offensive can library material truly be? I do not believe that is very offensive at all. There will be movies and material specifically designed for a mature an older age group. This is fine; if the person choosing the material is of age then he or she should have no reason not to choose advanced material. A mature person will not want to read elementary books their entire life. Sooner or later, they will have to be intruduced into the real life. It would not be beneficial to them or society if they are sheltered their entire lives. Also, if the person is still a child, there should be no reason for a child to choose the older level of material. There may be times when he does; however, this is not a problem because all the parent has to do is explain to him that he is not of age yet. This is an easy fix. As I said earlier, ther is no reason we all need to read the same thing. Variety is what makes libraries apealing to the customers. Who would want to go to a library with all the same books? I myself would not. Within the library, there are sections specifically just for children. If all the slightly offensive material was to be taken out of libraries, that would eliminate a large portion of the customers. Also, this would discourage writers from even producing thier material; thus hindering their income and motivation. We have freedom and choice in America, and I feel this would go against American values if they were to induce censorhip in a harmless library. No one is perfect and we all make mistakes. However, we can also improve and learn from them. If a person does choose an inapropriate book, they will most likely learn and improve from their mistake. We have a choice about what to choose when we go into the library. I believe if not all, the majority of the time we make the right choice. Libraries are a supercenter of learning and information. This would not be true if certain portions of information began to be removed. I have had many worthwhile times in the library and was never once harmed or offended. Libraries are here to help and not to hinder our learning. I am most likely not the only one who feels pleased with the way libraries are now and feel no need to change what is good, as the current system allows for individual growth and learning through free access to diverse materials.
954	3931	2	3	My opinions on the censorship in libraries are that libraries are great places to get information on books such as biographies, fiction, nonfiction, science fiction, and other genre books. I don't believe that books, music, movies, magazines and other things should not be removed off the shelves because people love music and they want to get information about the artist who made the songs and information about the artist's life. Also people want to learn the lyrics to the song so they can sing along. The reason why books shouldn't be removed off the shelves is because people enjoy reading books and they want to know what the book is about and have some information about the book's plot or characters. Books are very important to people and provide some entertainment other than television or other forms of media. Also people use books to study, for instance, if a book is going to be read and then there is going to be a test on it. The books that are found offensive should be removed because people get very upset if they find out that the book is talking bad about them or a group they belong to. Unless some people are not mature at all and can't read books that are not even talking about them and take it too personally. Movies shouldn't be removed off of shelves because people love watching movies and they are very entertaining to them, providing an escape or a shared experience. If a movie is very offensive to the people, yes it is probably best to remove the movie because they don't want to watch it anymore. But other movies are not even bad or harmful. Yes some movies have foul language but people still enjoy it for the story or acting. But sometimes in movies people hear something from the movie and they spread it around the school or workplace. Then everybody starts saying the foul language. People just have to learn how to not use foul language when not needed and be responsible for their own speech. Magazines shouldn't be removed because people love reading magazines, especially sports related. I know I love reading sports magazines because I am a very true sports fan and sports are very important to me other than school; they provide a hobby and a sense of community. There are very inappropriate magazines that children shouldn't be reading and they should be removed off of shelves or kept in an area where adults can only access them. Magazines are also used for different things such as comics, housework tips, as well as for ladies' makeup, perfume, etc. People think that magazines are very important to the society and offer information and entertainment to a wide range of interests, so they should remain available with some discretion.
955	3932	2	3	Censorship in libraries is almost a primitive if not childish way to exclude what one might think to be offensive from everyone else, is it not? Think about it. A kid who doesn't let another kid play with him at recess today, only because he stuck his tongue out at him during math the previous day, seems pretty childish, and several much more reasonable solutions come to mind to anyone who sits and thinks about the situation for more than a second. This scenario runs parallel with censorship in libraries. A book is a book to be read. That is, of course, an obvious statement. But why read a book? To get information. To learn something that you did not know, or to build on knowledge that you already had. How do you cook an exquisite meal? Go read a book to find out. How do you graph linear equations? There are books that will explain it for you. Is it fair for an avid astronomer, feeling no need to know how long a turkey needs to stay in an oven, to remove a book that teaches that very thing? Now, of course cooking a turkey will most likely not come across as offensive to someone perusing through their local library, however, think about this. The book has been written, so is that not a sure sign it is not offensive to at least one person, that being the author? There are things people will not agree with. And just when you think you find something everyone likes, someone will come along and disturb the peace. Not everyone likes rap music, but it is still playing on the radio. It is free choice to listen to it. It is a free choice to read a book, regardless of what it says. Just because people have the misfortune to be subjected to material they find offensive, by accident or otherwise, and then project their disdainful comments toward someone in charge, does not mean that the offensive material should be thrown out. Perhaps, radios and libraries can be even further examined. Radios have specific channels, playing specific music. There is a country music channel for those who want to listen to country music. As for libraries, there is of course the American Library Association, but that is about as far as categorization goes. Suppose books be even further distinguished by the location within a library. A certain area designated for certain genres. That way, if you happen to find books about Nazi concentration camps distasteful, then you can avoid the Nazi and Concentration Camp aisle of the history reference and biography section in your library. Problem solved. I find it hard to see something as offensive if I can't even literally see it. You see, outright removal isn't really the best option for pleasing dissatisfied people. Compromise is. Now, after having thought about this situation for more than a second, I'm sure you have thought of much more reasonable solutions than something so ludicrous as censorship, and we can focus on the best part: seeing people enjoy books, and not being offended by the ones they don't like anymore.
956	3933	2	3	Having libraries is a good thing because it teaches children to learn how to read and get examples from the book or magazine that they are reading or just looking at it. Libraries can help children and family members, even those who hardly know how to read and write, by offering accessible materials and resources. Some libraries have shelves, and some don't, but libraries generally have books and magazines for children, adults, and even grandparents. To manage the books, libraries need staff who respect the collection and are willing to do the physical work of shelving and organizing materials on bookshelves and carts. Librarians can offer more than just books; they can also provide CDs, computers, and coloring pages for children. However, some believe certain materials shouldn't be in libraries because children might encounter things they don't understand. These individuals feel librarians should address inappropriate content and ask for its removal, focusing instead on creating a quiet space for reading and homework using computers. It's thought that inappropriate things can teach children bad habits, and librarians should consider removing such materials to prevent children from taking home books with unsuitable content. The suggestion is to relocate such items to a more appropriate setting, ensuring children only have access to suitable learning resources, ultimately protecting children from potentially harmful or confusing content.
957	3934	2	3	Books, Movies, Music, and Magazines? Do people take books, movies, music, and magazines seriously? Some people believe books, movies, music, and magazines should be censored or 'banned'. Why do people believe this should happen? Well there will be three topics that will be talked about in this essay. The three topics are children, race, and religion.  First, Children. Many parents themselves don't want their child to be exposed to violence, vulgar language, or even possible drugs. Violence is one of the main problems to do with all four of these types of entertainment. Influencing their child could cause a loss by doing things as far known as stupidity. Another is vulgar language, to adults for a generation above us, they take it as being disrespectful. News wide to this very day deals with drugs and teens getting more into them, causing an overdose that could lead to death.  Second, Race. Many people going from black to whites to everyone around the world with different colored skin or more different type of features as one another. Here starts racism, meaning against ones color or there ethics. Now to this day it has been calmed down but there was a time that certain words labeled certain people showing that they were less than others. Leading this to riots and gang violence to earning respect. They want to be treated as an equal not less than others that which our ancestors did them in the past.  Third, Religion. Religion is pretty big in the world and shows a lot about the past and what certain people believe in. Religion is shown in these four types of form in these objects. Everyone believes theirs is the right way and someone else's is the wrong. They cause conflicts in between one another. So trying to keep them from being banned isn't going to help for religion matters, because people do talk and some people out there want to change certain people to believe what they think is right.  So back to, do people take books, movies, music, magazines seriously? Well it's going to be exposed sooner or later. Options are let it happen now or let it happen later. The sooner could be better or for the worst. Either matters just let happen what happens, someone will learn from their experience so why ban now? These forms of media are pervasive, and attempting to suppress them entirely is ultimately a futile exercise, as exposure is inevitable in the long run.
958	3935	2	3	Leave @CAPS1 on the Shelves In every library it is intitle to have all types of books, movies, and magazines.Even if they are good or bad. Not everyone in this world is going to have the same likings.If there are people that are offened of what types of sources they find in the library I don't think it should be taken off of the shelves. Everyone in able to agree or disagree in what types of things they like. If the library didn't how would people learn about things today that are going on in this world, because not everything that is said on television is true. Every library in the world should not take certian books, movies, and magazines down just so kids or anyone else can't read @CAPS1 or watch @CAPS1 because there might be other people who would like to read @CAPS1 or watch @CAPS1. If the libraries took down certain books, movies, and magazines then it shouldn't even be called a library because it is suppose to have all types of sources. Not everyone is going to have the same opinion on whether or not certain books,movies, or magazines should be in the library, but all types of these sources should stay in the library beacuse if they are offensive to some people there aren't going to be like that for everyone so that wouldnt't be fair for the other people who enjoy reading, looking at magazines to see whats new ,or watching all different types of moive, and listening to music. I think that the librarians should not take anything down in their libraries because they know what they are doing when they put those sources on the shelves and also they should stay on the shelves because if they didn't want people to feel offended then they wouldn't have made books, moive, or magazine that would offend people today. Libraries don't leave the sources on the shelves on perpose for people to feel offended, they leave @CAPS1 for other people to read.With this being said all types or books, magazines, or movies should be left on the shelves to help other people learn what they want to learn about, and we must trust individuals to make their own decisions about what they choose to consume.
959	3936	2	3	I think that they shouldn't remove the censorship books in the libraries because bigger kids can read the books, not the little kids, because they don't need to hear the kind of words in the books. Also, the little kids have too small of ears to hear and also too small of eyes to even see the words in the book like that. The bigger kids, like in grades 6, should be able to look at the books because it will be words that they have heard before.  The books shouldn't be in the lower-grade libraries because the little kids will check the books out of the libraries, like the books that are called *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* because it says the n-word a lot of times, and another one is *The Hate U Give* and *All American Boys* because they say a lot of dirty words like the f, s, and etc. words that they don't need to hear that young of age.  Another reason why it wouldn't be fair to the bigger kids if they take away the books from the libraries is because they are trying to get them out of the libraries so the littler kids don't get the books to take home to read at home. If you are going to take away the books, take them away from the grades 1-3 because the book called *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*, *The Hate U Give*, and *All American Boys* will be bad for those kids to read.  Some more reasons why bigger kids should read the books and why the little kids shouldn't read the books include the fact that bigger kids in grade 6 should read them because they are bigger than the littler kids. The littler kids shouldn't because we don't want the littler kids to go home and say the words to their mom, dad, grandma, grandpa, and etc.  Now I have come to the end of my persuasive essay for the newspaper about my reflecting on why or why not we should get rid of the censorship in the libraries. Also, until the next time I write again about this topic, I hope that you liked this persuasive essay for the newspaper, which ultimately suggests keeping these books available but restricting them to older students who are more prepared to handle the content.
960	3937	2	3	Picture for yourself you, as a 7 year old child sitting in front of one of the greatest philosophers of history, Socrates. Days later, you come to find out that he has been killed for 'corrupting the minds of the children.' HOW AWFUL! One of the greatest minds in human history has been censored because they didn't like his ideas. This is censorship at a basic level, and it happens to millions of books, movies, and songs every day. Censorship is not only wrong, its unnecessary. Here's why.  FIRST OFF, when it comes down to it, most books, movies, and songs are meant to be interpreted in many different ways. For example, some poems are written with a vague tone so that they can be interpreted in different ways based upon the person. Besides, most music and books are meant to entertain, not offend. Granted, some books are meant to be interpreted in a certain way, but that still doesn't mean that they were meant to offend. Think about it next to you look at a copy of 'THE GREAT GATSBY' by F. SCOTT FITZGERALD; is it really that offensive to you?  When you are given a book in school for a class assignment, they usually expect you to read it because its of some educational value to you. Books like 'To KILL a MOCKINGBIRD' provide a huge educational value because they show what SOUTHERN culture was like, but everyday, someone new is trying to get it off the shelves of every school library in AMERICA because they find it offensive. Ask yourself, is it right? The answer for me is no, since books like that hold an educational value that outweighs their offensiveness.  There's one last thing you must understand, and that is the fact that no matter how many books you take off the shelves, and no matter how many movies you ban, or how many songs you take away from us, the problem still isn't solved, its just been suppressed enough for different problems to arise, and those problem are that there are people who wanted to read this book BUT can't because you thought it was offensive. THEN this person complains to whomever banned this form of literature, and the book or other form of literature is put back on the shelves. THEN you feel it right to try and ban it again, but what does that solve? Nothing. Even if someone doesn't unban it, people can still teach and tell of what its about, making the ban worthless.  I hope that before you think about complaining about some book you found offensive, you think about this. Your complaint that causes the banning affects everyone. It affects a teacher's ability to teach, and a student's ability to learn. Is it really right of you to take away a good teaching material? Or you could ask yourself, what does it really solve? Either way, you still must know that banning these things is wrong, and that open access to information and diverse perspectives is crucial for a well-rounded education and a thriving society.
961	3938	2	3	I think that the bad books, and all the adult books, magazines, and all the other articles should have its own room in the libraries. If you don't want little kids and teenagers in those kinds of books and magazines then put a lock on the door and if you have proof of ID that shows your 18 then you are going to be aloud back there if you don't have proof of ID then I guess your not going back to the adult section. I say this because they have movies at the movie stores that are not aloud to be seen unless your 18, but the thing is kids have imaginations that if you read a book you can also see pictures just like a movie. The movies in the movie store are locked up in a back room where you have to be 18 or older to go back there and look. I bet its ruff when your kid is reading books and getting bad words out of them and saying them around like an even younger sibling, because then thats just going to cause a bigger problem then what you started out with. People have to understand theses days that kids are growing up way to fast to just leave stuff like that laying around. Parents need to keep stuff like magazines, movies, pictures, books and stuff like that up away from kids. I feel like once you become a parent you automatically think your smarter than a kid but yet kids are pretty darn smart. I understand its only a word but its disrespectful to have your kids running around cussing and saying inappropriate things to nice people. When kids do that then other parents that don't let their kids do that stuff think ' wow these parents obviously don't care'. I have a feeling that its never going to stop but it would be better if childrens parents did not let them cuss around other people ok at home if your parents don't care then sure but when you go out to eat or something and your son or daughter is over there cussing like a freight train its all because of those books she has been reading, the magazines and the movies. I'm going to close this little description now and I'm still against kids cussing under the age of being a mature teen, because exposing them to such language prematurely can have negative effects on their development and social interactions.
962	3939	2	3	There are many inappropriate types of entertainment in the world, but does that mean we should take them all away? I believe that censoring things such as books, movies, and music in a library is not a good idea. We would not have any diversity in the world or any type of entertainment because everyone has a different view on what they think is offensive or inappropriate.  With censoring materials in a library, it will extremely limit what we can learn. For example, if someone thought that a book about how an animal catches its prey was offensive, then if a person was interested in learning about that topic, they would not be able to. Many people's only way of research is at a library, so if they had an assignment for work and they could only get information on it there, they would not be able to finish their job if only one person thought a book about that topic was offensive. Also, people in the medical field have to watch many movies demonstrating certain procedures. What would they do if one person thought that a movie on what they were doing was offensive? They might not be able to save a person's life.  With censoring, there would be no diversity. Censoring would cause us to have a very small choice in what we could read for entertainment. It might even cause us to not have any books to read for entertainment because if one person does not like a certain book, it can be gotten rid of. So if not all the books are gone, there is still going to be a few books to choose from. It would cause all to read the same books, therefore making the diversity very small.  I see only a few good points in censoring. Yes, it would prevent children from learning or hearing about inappropriate or offensive things, but that is what is in our world, and I believe that we just have to accept it. Our society today is filled with crime, hatred, sexually explicit content, and profanity, but there is no changing that. Censoring might hide that for a small amount of time, but it's not going to keep it away forever. Censoring is not going to change our society. While parental guidance is essential, complete removal isn't the solution.  I do not think that we should censor things in our libraries. It can only lead to a downfall in our communities. It is a bad idea because I do not believe that it can help us more than it would hurt us. Censoring will cause a lack in diversity, education, and a true realization of our society, ultimately leading to a less informed and more homogenous community.
963	3940	2	3	Now, one way or another that certain piece of material will be found and be used. Someone out there in this world will appreciate that material and want to share it with others. So really, either way you in **May** try to remove any material that you think is offensive, but is it your right? I don't suppose so; I would consider that unfair. It's unfair that you were able to see this material, and just because you thought it was offensive, it does not mean that others in **May** find that offensive in their opinion. So the idea of pulling them off the shelf for your own selfish opinion is ridiculous. For you to do that would be defeating the purpose of being a **GATEKEEPER** for the author of that material. Having the freedom to sell or convey something they want viewers, readers, listeners, etc. to look at and use, would not happen because a person or a small group of people consider it offensive. It's a big world out there, you think just because you can try and hide certain material from people in your area to see, that no one will find a way, people will always find a way for it to get out or be found. It would be as if you're trying to control what people should be viewing, listening, reading, etc. Almost as if you're in control of people, but you got to realize that you can't hide everything in this world. Also that not everybody in this world has the same mindset as you do, and that whatever you find offensive in **May** not, or actually does not mean everyone else does. So this leads to my conclusion that it should not be your right to remove material from shelves that only you or a group of people find offensive. Do not try to control what people or children should view, listen, or read because it will be found sooner or later. No matter how hard you want this world to be perfect, reality is that it won't happen, and you can't keep everything hidden, therefore attempts to censor should be carefully re-evaluated.
964	3941	2	3	Most people do not think that kids should see certain things if they are found offensive, like some books, music, movies, and magazines. I do not believe books or any other thing should be removed from libraries shelf. It should be the parent's choice what their child can look at or listen to. But now days when a child's parent or any other authority don't let them do, watch, or listen to something it makes kids want it more. Since they want it more they will find a way to do, watch, or listen to whatever it may be. They will even go behind their parents' backs and probably won't care if they get in trouble.  With this new generation, authority can only limit so much of what children see today. Children see a lot of things that they are interested in and can find it all different types of ways. Computers, television, and the radio are three different major ways of finding things that maybe offensive but kids are interested in all the time. Young parents, I do believe, are one of the reasons kids know about these movies, books, music, and magazines. They say things and do things that young people should not know at a young age, and that's what makes kids think it's alright when their parents do whatever it may be. So, let it be the parent's choice of what their child can see, because either way, they are going to be able to find a way to get it, so parental guidance is ultimately more effective than outright banning.
965	3942	2	3	Katherine Paterson is saying what is correct. There's a lot of people around this world that are very sensitive about their things in their house and around their life that they wouldn't want anyone to touch or be around.  One important thing that I have that means so much to me & my husband is the CD that my father gave to us right before he passed away. Me & my husband have been wanting to listen to it for a very long time, but we just can't get the nerve to do it. We do not like it when someone thinks they can just do what they want by walking up there where we have that CD and just grab ahold of it. Me and my family do not like that, so we say something. That's one thing that we don't like for anyone to touch, because it means so much to us!  Most people think we are crazy because we don't like anyone to be around or touch it, but all I have to say is that there are other people around this area that are more crazy about their things being touched. For example: 'Don't be over there by my clock hanging on the wall, I don't want you to knock it off, so get away from it!' That is something that my bestfriend's mother had said before, & she still feels the same way still to this day! But I mean it's just how we feel about everything around us that means alot.  But to get back to the situation about why do people get so fustrated about things that are hanging on the wall, or things that are in cases and that's where they have been for years and years. It's because it means so much to them. It's not just cause they're mean or because of some kind of reason to gripe. It just because it means so much to them, & when I say means alot to them, I mean a bunch bunch!! They're just trying to say that it means more then anything to them and they do not want it to be bothered. Just try to understand what they're trying to say to you, because it could mean so much & you could get to the point to watch out for it also, just to help out.  But the story that Katherine Paterson had wrote is saying the right thing, & she also probably has things in her life to that means alot to her. You just have to reconize what she has that is so important because there is alot of people that have important things in their life, & you could be one of them. Just try to see & feel how alot of other people do around the world around you. Just have to remember what's important to someone and help keep an eye out with them & because a good friend to everybody else, showing that understanding and respect can make a big difference in how people feel valued and understood.
966	3943	2	3	What I do think is that they should keep everything in the library. Some people like to stay and read the newspaper and listen to music while out in the library. If you do think it's offensive, then don't read it or just pick out another book. Everybody has their own ideas on a library and if they want their voices heard let them speak it out. What I think about all this stuff in the library these days are good for the kids so they can learn faster and have a lot more to look forward to when they do get older. My own experiences in the library that I do see that there is a lot more people in the library and there is a lot more you can do instead of reading books most of the time. You can read magazines or newspapers to pass the time when no one is home or to hang out with, and it does get boring just reading books so try something different for a little while then go back reading the book that you did start with and wanted to take a break from. Then other people have their own voice to say something if they don't want it in their library, which is their right, too.  Some of my observations that I have seen were not really good. I've seen some protesters in front of the libraries and I have seen them close down because of it. But people sometime can take it to far and do sometimes burn it to the ground. I have seen people cry over it and it makes me really upset that I want to do something to help them but I really can't do nothing. The most valueable thing is the kids and young children that read the books. What if someone burn down you home, this is how these kids feel when you close down the most safe place to them? They have the biggest voice of everybody put together. That if you do something that make them feel better that would be really good to them. That they have not done anything to deserve this kind of mess that we put them through. It is very difficult to have somewhere to go to read but there is nowhere to go.  If you don't want to be quiet then let your voice be heard aroud the world and have the freedom to let it come out, as that is what a library is supposed to represent. You have three diffenent voices your own, other people that do or don't agree and you have your children. So which one are you going to listen to? When you have a choice and you have to make it and hope you make the right one, keeping in mind that the library is a vital resource for all members of the community, especially the young.
967	3944	2	3	Should you conceal a child from the inappropriate half of the world? Not letting them hear, see, or read the bad in the world. Letting them grow up as innocent as possible. Should libraries take these procautions? In a world like ours were bad things happen everyday when it comes to people comminting suicide, being murdered, goverment scams, and even terrorist attacks its hard to keep people that shouldnt know, from knowing. It is very easy for our nation to figure things out, all we have to do is watch TV or even go to our local library. While we already censor what goes onto our television, we dont think to care as much for our libraries. Our libraries have anything from thousands of book and magizines and now having an equal, or more, amounts of movies, music, and videogames.  I think a library should have censorship when it comes to what they have and how they organize it. There should be different sections of libraries, much like they do now, of age groups and what is appropriate for them, and to avoid people checking-out items that are from sections above them they have an age group security check on the libraries card fileing system. This sounds very complicated but at least we are doing as much as possible for trying not to expose anyone to anything they are to young for.  When it comes to offensive material, I think that should not be taken off the shelf but put into a different place in the library. Some people need to read some thing they find offensive, maybe they need to read it for a class, maybe the book is offensive but needs to be read because it teaches a very good life lesson. There is a book that is called '@CAPS3' its by a man with the last name of @LOCATION1. It sounds very offensive but it actually teaches people the origin of the word and how it came to be offensive to people. It @MONTH1 be offensive for some people to read but it teaches a lesson in why people shouldnt say it.  Yes, there are always going to be some parents out there that don't care as much when it comes to what there child read, watches, listens to, or plays. But, for there kids to get it, there parents will have to come and get it for them, that way the parents know what they are extracting from the library. In this way, libraries can strike a balance between protecting children and providing access to information, ensuring that parents are involved in their children's choices and that potentially harmful content is not easily accessible.
968	3945	2	3	We all find things offensive, whether it be in a book, magazine, movie, CD, TV show, or a newspaper article. Libraries hold all of those items, and some people might want to remove the items that they think are offensive, but would that be right? If everyone went to the library and took everything that they thought was offensive off the shelves, we would have nothing left.  Maybe writers should just cut down on things that are inappropriate, racist, or things that include foul language. Then not as many people would be offended, and they would not have any problems with letting their children pick out books on their own. Although, it might not be the writers at fault here. It could be the readers. Some people should just stop taking everything so seriously, then they would not have to worry about things like what their children are reading.  Yes, most adult things now are inappropriate for children, but that's why it is for adults. Children have their own selection of books and movies. And parents need to realize that maybe they should take their kids to the children's section. All types of entertainment are categorized by age, and people should start paying more attention to that. If parents started watching what their kids do, then they would not be worrying about them reading or watching something they should not be. That is what parents are for, taking care of their children, and some people do not do a very good job of that.  If there is a book you read and it is something you do not want your child to read, it is probably something you read when you were older, so do not worry about it until they get to that age. And maybe then it would be okay if they read it, because they are old enough to realize right from wrong. Parents cannot always control what their children do. And if they do by chance pick up the book their parents never wanted them to read, they might see it in a different way than their mother or father did, and they might learn a very valuable lesson from it, showing that exposure to different perspectives can be a beneficial part of growing up.
969	3946	2	3	When going to a library you expect to see various books, movies, music, magazines, and maybe other items. If a person is looking for a book that maybe could be offensive to a race, culture, religion, or etc., they should still be able to check out that book. Libraries shouldn't be able to control those situations, because it's a person's choice or adult's choice to read those kinds of stories. In our country we are allowed to express our opinion by the FIRST AMENDMENT. The FIRST AMENDMENT includes free speech which ensures that anyone can express their personal feelings or their opinion on certain matters. If a person would want to check out a book that could offend another individual technically by the law they have the right to do so. I'm not condoning that someone should read books, listen to music, or even watch movies that could be hateful or cruel, but by the law it's ok for people to want to read, listen, or watch those works. Libraries are government funded organizations. Therefore meaning they don't have the right to disregard these works. The government pays for the books that are purchased into the library. This means they need books that people would want to read, and be interested in even though some groups of people might not agree it's their job. I'm not encouraging reading these novels or listening to offensive music, but as citizens of the UNITED STATES we are allowed to listen to what we want, and read anything we want, because that's what our country is meant to stand for freedom. When I think of AMERICA I think freedom, and I have to say I'm proud our country stands for that, and we should stand for that freedom even when it comes to the small things in life, like choosing what to read.
970	3947	2	3	Know you ask me to write an essay to a newspaper reflecting my views on censorship in libraries. Well ok then I will you my not like what I have to say but I really dont care if it was up to your dam goverment to decide what we could say or what we can read or even do. Theyd have us all in our house with our hands tied so we couldent learn more then how to eat, clean, and dress our selfs.  Now the way I see it is that we have every rite to read any book we please when we whant to read it. now if we dont want to read a book then we dont have to read it. but we as a people and they as a goverment do not have the rite to take your books out of the libraries. Now we as a people can press any thing we want no matter what they as in the goverment thinks it is the people who run the stat not the dam goverment.  My point is, is that the books are there to teach us about our lives, our histoy. Books teach us about what wrong and what is rite. Books are here to give sceary story by a camp fire they are here to give kids a bed time story. If we take thos books off our shelves you think the kids of your generation are bad just wait the next one will be worse than this one i promise you that.  Now it is our rite to save our books, if we do not then us as will be lost. For without book our passed is lost, our fock tales are forgoten, our kids will not be able to sleep at night without there storys.  Now come guy as a all pull it together. If you see a book on the shevles and you think its offences then by put the dam thing down and walk away from it dont complane about it. No one told you that you had to read it. So don't ruine it for everyone just eather you dont belive in and you think that the bibles not rite then dont touch. its the same way around if you do bleave in and you think that all book that tell about a witch or vampires or that my even have a hore house in just leave it alone. its just a dam book let us read them. See you guy blame us kids that the vido games roten our minds but realy its the parent that dose see there is nothing more a teenanger like myself loves to do more than to do something there mom or dad says not. So gut just back off and let us read and play and do what in the hell we want to do, because ultimately, restricting access to books only breeds ignorance and resentment, hindering our ability to learn, grow, and make informed decisions about the world around us.
971	3948	2	3	Many people like different books, music, movies, and magazines. Some people take offense to them. Others do not. For me I dont. I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves because there are different types for different types of people. If a person took offense from a book or magazine I believe that person should just put it back. If books that offended people couldn't be on the shelves there would be no books on the shelves because I'm sure there's atleast one person in the world that would take offense to each book. There are a lot of people in the world after all. For music there's different types also. There's rap, country, rock, pop and many more. For example if someone likes rap but not country that person has a choice to listen to rap and not country. If that person doesn't like country though it shouldn't be removed because others like country and want to listen to it. For movies there are many different types. There's horror, comedy, romance and many more. That's why at the theater there's different rooms for different movies. People always have a choice. Many people like different books, music, movies, and magazines. Some people take offense to them although some don't. Every person is different. People like different things. That is, in my opinion, the beauty of human nature, and we should embrace the diversity of preferences rather than trying to censor or eliminate things simply because some individuals find them objectionable.
972	3949	2	3	The views on censorship in libraries definitely varies from person to person. There are those who are offended by the material that is out there for anyone to access, and then there are those who want the right to read, listen, and watch whatever they choose. I believe there are pros and cons to each choice, either way you look at it, but there does need to be some sort of censorship in libraries; the line must be drawn somewhere. The lyrics in music can come off extremely offensive to some people. The inappropriate scenes in movies, whether it be involving two people of opposite sex or intense action moments, are not something people of a young age should be exposed to. The easy access to the library is part of the problem. Someone of any age can get their hands on just about anything they want. In my own experience, I have had the opportunity to get whatever I wanted at the library. The advertising pictures on the cover of books, movies, magazines, etc., gave me a false sense of what the material really contained when I was younger. I came home from a day at the library with materials that my parents did not approve of. If you look at it from the other point of view, you would probably be thinking, if we got rid of all material that someone would find offensive, our libraries would be left with close to nothing. In reality, I believe that once people realized that exposure to this kind of material is offensive, authors would change the way they would write; directors would change the way they produced movies; artists would change the lyrics to their songs. So yes, library's shelves would have been rid of many materials, but they would be replaced with what the people want. Others might argue that they have the right to read, listen, and watch what they would like. This might be true, but shouldn't others have the right to let their children go to libraries without worrying about the gruesome material they might be exposed to? Although to some people this argument might go either way, if the line is never drawn on what is available, who knows what the world might come to. From here, the material can only get more offensive, more disturbing, and leave a bigger effect on the minds of people. Children will be exposed to the 'evils' of this world at even a younger age, and if that is all they ever know, they won't realize what else this world has to offer them. Authors, directors, producers, and artists will all change their material if we show them that it is not what we want, ultimately leading to a more positive and constructive environment for everyone.
973	3950	2	3	Yes, I think that certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed because they could hurt people's feelings and lead to negative outcomes such as suicide and drama. Having such materials in a library could be detrimental to individuals' emotional well-being. I wouldn't want to encounter racial comments about myself in a book, and I believe others feel the same way. Removing these materials could improve some people's lives.  From an experience in the library last week, I witnessed a young African American girl crying after reading something offensive about her race in a book; she expressed worry about the possibility of slavery returning. Reading about people making fun of my life, calling me names, or even violence would ruin my day. Libraries should take steps to remove such content from their collections.  Having provided convincing arguments based on my personal experience, I believe libraries should seriously consider my advice. They should realize that having that kind of material is not good for kids, teenagers, or even adults, as it can bring people down, cause them to cry, and even lead to harmful actions. Removing all this material would be a smart choice, ultimately making things better for everyone and fostering a more positive and supportive environment.
974	3951	2	3	Imagine walking into a library where the shelves are empty. A library where there are no books to lose one's self in the pages. A library where we are not allowed to read controversial classics that fill and open our minds to new views. A library where works of literature such as the American Library Association, To Kill a Mockingbird, and Maya Angelou are not on the shelves awaiting students to dive into their pages. Some of the greatest books ever written are respected for their controversy and mind blowing ideas. Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice which is being taken over by modern technology. A number of children in the United States are unable to read at their appropriate grade level. This number is greatly increasing due to poor education opportunities, lack of interest in education, and lack of resources in the United States. Reading is the fundamental basis for each and every school subject. It is proven that children who are successful readers are five times more likely to be overall more successful students. However, by censoring what books are allowed in a classroom and library we are taking away a child's chance to broaden their minds. We are also taking away books that may interest a child. Children are 40% more likely to read a book that they are interested in. Allowing a child not to read a book, such as 'Harry Potter' is unpractical and harmful to the child. By taking away a book that students greatly enjoy it discourages them from reading altogether. A person not only has the right to the best education one can receive, they also have the right to read whatever they want. Books open up a child's mind to new places and adventures that they may not ever be able to experience in their lifetime. Books have the ability to broaden people's minds. Some of the most interesting and controversial books that challenge an individuals beliefs and thoughts are being taken off the shelves and no longer readily available to people. America was founded on the basis of freedoms; freedom of speech, freedom of thought. Why should this freedom not apply to books? Why should any person be allowed to tell another person what you can and can not read? And why should these books be available to everyone through public libraries? This freedom should apply to books. No one should be allowed to tell another person what they can and can not read. And these books should not be censored in public and school libraries. No one should be denied the chance to learn. By censoring books in libraries throughout America, millions of children are being denied the chance to learn. We live in a world where televisions, computers, iPods, and cell phones can be found in most homes and in everyone's hands. Books are thought of as 'a thing of the past' and not up to speed with today's technology. However, books are an important part of one's education. Censoring libraries discourage kids to read even more than they already are discouraged to reading. Kids do not want to be told what they can and can not read and by taking away the books they want we are supressing their minds. Censoring will only make them want to read less, and play on the computer more. Censoring in libraries is also a pointless and non effective method. Kids with internet access can look up almost anything on their home computers. The things they find on the internet will be more controversial then the majority of books that are being censored. A favorite book of many kids is the Harry Potter series. These books have been taken out of many libraries for their use of witchcraft. However a child could go home and watch the movies or search the internet for something more controversial. Censoring is pointless because children have other ways of viewing things that would be censored in a library. Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice that is being taken over by modern technology. Today's youth is exposed to wars, terrorist attacks, gangs, domestic violence and drive bys everyday. The world of books can be an escape from the world they live in. Books can help a child overcome poverty, mental challenges, and violence everyday. The pages of books fill them with hope and give them courage to create a better future for themselves. The inspirational stories in books have inspired millions to achieve more then they thought possible. Censoring would take away the chances for our future generations to become inspired by these books. Censoring would only hurt our youth and the greatness that they can accomplish, and it's for this reason that we must fight against it to ensure a brighter future for all.
975	3952	2	3	First of all I believe if it’s on the shelf you should be able to get it, no matter what your age is. Yeah there's things that shouldn't be on the shelf, but how are kids and people supposed to know to get that or not. If kids aren't allowed to get certain material on the shelves, then it shouldn't be there, @CAPS1 my opinion.  Parents @MONTH1 think different, parents might think only certain things should be allowed at a library. @CAPS1 not their choice though. Anything is allowed to be at a library. If you don't want your kid reading or getting certain things, then when your kid goes to the library go with them. Help them pick out a book. Guide them to what you deem appropriate.  In conclusion I believe you should be able to check anything that is on the shelf, kid or if you're an adult. If you're not allowed to get it, then why is it there? I don't know I couldn't answer that question, other than why is it there? @CAPS1 my opinion though, and I believe that free access promotes intellectual exploration for everyone.
976	3953	2	3	'@CAPS1 are you reading' asked mom. I immediatley hid the book behind my back, knowing she wouldn't like the idea of me reading such an in depth book. Some parent don't like for their kids to read some content. If it's not okay at home it shouldn't be okay at school. There is some subjects that maybe we shouldn't but we do because our parents say no. Removing said subjects will remove the chance of disobeying or parents, and coping behavor from book. There are books, movies, magazines and music that is 'cool', but not all that appropriate. Some movies and music use offensive language and actions that some kids pick up on and refelct actors, actresses and artists. Soon they start making a name for themselves by using such language or actions and eventually becomes known as the bad kid. Students such as myself are inferior to being popular or noticed, so they feel the need to do things to become noticed. Most things students model after are the things they see, hear, or watch, such as the media. Sometimes students choose to imitate these negative behaviors in an attempt to gain acceptance.  It is wise to set censors in the libraries, for students. Though some students don't nessicearily want censorship in libraries, it is only for their best intrest to remove materials that are offensive. It will make students including myself better people by not learning of the things we hear about or watch. I think by using censorship it will help student to make the decison at home to to become involved in such thing. By limiting access to inappropriate content, students can focus on positive influences.  I have noticed that students often watch how movie stars and famous people act, if they are a fan or the famous person then they are more likey to model after them and do the thing they do. Lets say I was a fan of @PERSON1 and I read that she stole something. Being a fan of her I would either find someone else to model after or do as she does because it cool. If I did the things @PERSON2 done my parents would most likely kill me, and if I got luck somehow and they didn't then I would go to jail for sure. Therefore, it is important to provide guidance and support to students as they navigate the media.  So in conclusion, I think censorship is important in libraires because it insures the well being of students and protects them form things they odn't need to be part of. I would respect the idea of censory in my school becaus eI would know it is only there to help me. I hope that all students see that it is important not to be subject to violence, sex, drugs, drama, through movies, music, magazines, or books, as this will ultimately help them make better choices and lead more fulfilling lives.
977	3954	2	3	"I don't think censorship should be practiced in libraries, it's not fair to everybody. If censorship was practiced everywhere, there probably would not be any movies or anything entertaining out, due to a large amount of people complaining. I have a few reasons also I think there should not be censorship in libraries. My first reason is freedom of the press. In our country, we are given the right of writing what we want, and if censorship continues, we will lose one of our rights. I don't think that's fair to control what we want to write or read. Another reason I have would be freedom of speech. Also written in our Constitution of the United States, we are given the right to say what we want, and nobody can control that. If we keep using censorship, then this right will also be taken away from us. We're slowly losing our God given rights, because people are offended by books and things of that nature. A personal experience I have was one day my friend and I were going to go to the library to get a book for our history report. The report had to be over the 1800's and slavery. Unfortunately, my friend was African American, and he had a hard time not being offended by the assignment. When we got to the library, things got worse. All of the books we found were over how bad the slaves were treated back then. My friend was getting very upset at this point. Finally, he saw another book making fun of the slaves, then he went up to the librarian asking, ""Can you take those books off the shelf and put them somewhere else?"" The librarian just looked at him with a straight face and said, ""No. What makes you think you should get any special treatment?"" My friend was dumbfounded. He couldn't believe what he had just heard. After he had came back over to where I was sitting, I had told him that she was right. ""How's that?"", he said. I said, ""because if she would've taken all those books down, she would've had to take about every other book down too, because somebody would find something hurtful."" ""You know, your probably right,"" he said. Censorship isn't fair, because it limits us to our abilities and what we enjoy. It's not fair to punish other people based on what they read, write, or say. We all have our own preferences; how would you like it if yours got taken away? Libraries should remain a place for open access and diverse perspectives, not a place where ideas are suppressed based on subjective sensitivities."
978	3955	2	3	Some people often go to the library to check out books, movies, magazines, etc. But what some people might not realize is that some of the things that they have at the library might be offensive towards certain people. I think that everything that's in the libraries should stay there. Obviously, the library allowed it there for some reason, considering factors like literary merit or historical significance. So honestly, it can't be that bad. I do not think certain things should be removed from the library. People have to realize that that's life. There's going to be certain things that you don't like, but you have to deal with it. If you watch TV, you'll notice that there's some offensive things towards certain people, but no one really makes a huge thing out of it.  The books might be offensive to you, but to someone else, it could just be another book that they want to read, with no intentive purpose of offending anyone. The library is all about learning. Everything is for educational purposes, offering diverse perspectives and materials. I've read books that I stopped and thought about for a second while I was reading it and noticed that there's some pretty harsh things in it, but I didn't complain about it, I just kept reading.  A lot of books are based off of true events so no matter how offensive they are to people, you just have to think what the purpose was for the author to create this book and same thing with movies, so people can see what the author has to say. Everyone has the right to have their own opinion, and that's what most magazine articles are about, expressing what you think about a certain topic.  Even in the English class that I'm in now, we had to read 'To Kill A Mockingbird'. Some African American people might think it's racist, but it really isn't. The author is trying to get his point out of how things used to be before white and colored people were treated the same. Now if you still think that is being offensive towards you or other people then that's alright. That's why this is a free country. Everyone has the right to say how they feel and not get in trouble for it.  So I hope I got the point across that it's alright for some things to be offensive towards people, as long as that's not the whole point of what you're watching or reading, which I doubt it is. So next time you're reading or watching something that is offending you, think about the point that the person who wrote or made the movie were trying to get across. Maybe by it offending you, it is getting the point across, prompting reflection and understanding.
979	3956	2	3	Censorship can be a very good thing. It keeps inappropriate material from falling into the wrong hands. It also keeps the horrors that are in the censored material out of the community and that makes the community a better environment to live in. But too much censorship can become a bad thing. For instance @ORGANIZATION1, Nazi Germany, had an extreme censorship policy when he was burning all of those books. There also several books that talk about the censorship idea getting out of hand like the book @CAPS1 @NUM1, Fahrenheit 451. Libraries should censor some of there material. Books and magazines need to be censored according to there content. Books and magazines both use words and sometimes pictures to get there point across. If a book is using vulgar and inappropriate language in should be in some way censored. With this in mind I should not be able to pick a book and open it to find sexual dialog. I also shouldn't be able to find the constant use of swear words in a book or magazine. Also lots of people get offended with violence and lots of gore. Magazines and books also use pictures to help get there point across. If there are inappropriate pictures in either of the two sources that material should be censored. If I am walking through my local library and just see a magazine sitting ou with a nude picture on the front I'm going to wonder about my library's censorship policy. Another example would be that I pick up a book and start looking through it and it has an inappropriate picture in it, I am going to wonder about my library's censorship policy. Also if a magazine has an extremly violent picture or extremely gorey picture it should be cnesored. Overall if a book or magazine is extremely inapropriate, then it should be, in some way, censored. Music is another form of media that can be found at a library that should be censored. Musicians use artwork on the album sleeves to grab the attention of people. If that artwork includes swear words or inapropriate pictures it should be in some way or shape be censored. Musicians also play music of course. But if the lyrics to there songs are explicit or has many sexual themes it has to be conesored. Someone should have to deal with wading through music like that. No matter what, if an album of music is out of this world inaproiate, it should be censored. Movies are most likely the hardest things to sensor. This is because they use language, pictures, music, and video. Movies are multi-media monsters that can sometimes be very clean, and sometimes be very inapropriate. If a movie is rated @CAPS2, R, it should not be in a public library. Movies that are rated @CAPS3, PG-13, for sexual content, nudity, drug use, alcohol abuse, or swearing should be censored. A kid should not be able to get his hands on that kind of stuff in a public library. Also depending on how violent and a gorey a movie is it should be cenesored. Movies that are inapropriate, especially ones rated @CAPS3, PG-13, should be censored. The fact that this debate even needs to happen is sad. But it does so we must censor certain things that people @MONTH1 get a offended by if they saw it in there public library. Things containing nudity, sexual content, swear words, gore, and violence to possibaly be censored. There also needs to be a line where we stop sensoring or pretty soon, just like Katherine Paterson said we won't have any books left. But overall there needs to be some type of censorship in public libraries, ensuring that the community can access information responsibly and without unnecessary exposure to harmful content.
980	3957	2	3	As an individual, based on the books I have read, I believe some books need to be taken off the shelf. My concern is for the children who get a hold of these books. Kids should be kids and wait till they're older and more mature to know about certain things. This also includes music, movies, and magazines. Some people believe these things influence bad behavior like stealing, cussing, and even murder. The less obscene material we have the better we can control our kids, or at least some of them anyway. We see bad behavior every day like stealing, cussing, murder, and assault. Ever wonder what causes people to do it? Just look around you; they show it in movies, they talk about it in books. There are even songs about it, no wonder kids think it's okay to do these kind of things! If we limit these items, we will see positive results. Like I said before, kids should be kids and be free of these obscene materials. They will be exposed to it sometime, but hopefully when they're older. In the meantime, censors should be put on these items or they should be taken off the shelf, contributing to a more protected environment for children's development.
981	3958	2	3	"Do I believe that our libraries have some books on their shelves that they shouldn't have? Well, of course, I think that there are some books, music, movies, magazines, that young children should not read about, hear, or watch. These kinds of things affect our everyday living.  Let's start off with a book that has killing in it. I'm not a parent at the time, but I know for a fact that I wouldn't want my children reading about that kind of violence. That's not something that a twelve-year-old child should be reading about. Those kinds of books could get kids thinking, ""Oh, he killed someone, why couldn't I?"", and that's how some kids grow up to be bad and have to go to jail at the age of 15, because they have killed someone or tried at least. There also other books that some children shouldn't read about, and that might be about slavery. If a mother doesn't want their child to know about slavery at the age they're at, there shouldn't be that type of book on the shelves for a ten-year-old to read about. I mean, if I had family members that lived in the slavery days, I for sure wouldn't want my kids to read about it, because that shows how white people disrespected the blacks, and that could have an affect on that child. That could cause them not to like white people.  Second is the music. I know that most libraries don't have all that bad music that is on the radios, but I'm sure there is some music that has something about stealing on it. That's another thing that could give kids the wrong idea and send them on the wrong track again. There's just some things children shouldn't hear unless they're with one of their parents, and then that parent could explain to them that you shouldn't do what the song says. But they shouldn't be in our school or public libraries.  The third thing is movies. There should not be any movies of killing, breaking in peoples houses or fighting at any circumstance in a school library. School is not a place for a child to be watching those kind of things. That just gives a young child the wrong kind of idea, and isn't appropriate for schools to have.  The last one is magazines. There should not be magazines at school of women in their bathing suits or men without shirts on. That could make the kid think he could do that and he could get himself into big trouble.  That's what I think about the books, music, magazines, and movies in a library, and why some content needs careful consideration before being made available to children."
982	3959	2	3	If there are any books, movies, music, or magazines that are offensive, then I think they should be removed from the bookshelf out of caution for little kids. Everyone wants to look at different movies, books, or music that isn't right for kids, but we all have to know where kids get acts from. The books can be left on the shelf if the younger kids do not bother them. They have to know that adults don't always want to watch kids shows. There should be a right that adults can remove books from the shelf if they're not right for their kids. Yes, books, magazines, movies, and music should be left off the shelf if offensive. This is necessary because they can watch the movies and learn bad habits from the shows, listen to the music and learn bad words, and look at magazines and see bad pictures. So have kids stay away from offensive materials.  There are a lot of younger kids that love to get into stuff they are not supposed to, such as bad movies not for their age, because kids learn their bad habits from t.v. shows or even movies. If the movie is offensive then it should definitely stay off the shelves, unless it is just grown-ups in the house. If movies are just laying on the shelf or around the house, younger kids could always just grab them not knowing what it is and go watch it in their room.  Horrible music is just as bad, because they can listen to it and get their bad language from the MUSIC. If parents don't want their kids growing up to be bad people then I advise all parents to keep the worst MATERIALS away from children and hide them all. They can always hide them in their rooms, in a desk drawer for child safety. Have all kids stay away from offensive and bad items they are not allowed to be around.  Magazines are bad to look at if they have pictures not necessary for children. Watch all children around the magazines or look at the magazines before allowing them to read it. There MAY be disgusting pictures that children cannot see that young. So make sure they all stay clear and far away from them.  I would keep all items away from young children at all times, if they are not good. Just watch all children around magazines, movies, and music. All of these materials, all children can learn bad habits from. If they are not offensive then don't worry about them getting them to watch them, because it won't be bad. They all want to live a life sometime and act like they are adults, so sometimes you have to treat them like an adult. Yes, make sure all books, music, movies and magazines all stay away from young children if they are offensive, as movies need to stay away from children because they can learn bad habits from the shows, music needs to stay away from young children because they can learn bad language, and magazines need to stay away from young children also because they can look at bad pictures they aren't supposed to. It is important to be proactive and mindful about what media our children are exposed to, in order to foster a safe and nurturing environment.
983	3960	2	3	In a way many books are put on the library shelf for a reason. Some of the books take race, sexism, bullying, ect., to extreme. Putting myself in a child's shoes when they read those books, magazines, movies, music, ect., would have to be scary. The languages in movies and music are not what we think they are. Would you want your child, that's @NUM1, to go out and do what the other @NUM1 year olds do because they think it is cool for others to do? Remember back in the days when you were young and your parents didn't have to worry about what you were doing because your generation wasn't like the generations now? Well, these generations to come will probably get worse if we don't do something about it now. Taking some books off a shelf, or taking profanities out of a song will not hurt a child or teenager one bit. These things are telling your children it is ok to have sex, smoke, drink, or even cuss. I know that my mother worries about me @NUM3, because she's always calling me to check up on me and asking how my day was, or if i had any problems today. If we work together on taking care of all of the profanities then i bet the world would be a much safer and nicer place. Bullying wouldn't be a problem anymore; neither would cyer space or the drugs and alcohol. You need to step up and show your children that doing those things are not exceptable or nessesary in any life. Remember them that there is a whole life out there without the sex, drugs, and profanities. So, the next time you think that your going to buy a dvd or a cd preview it before you buy it. Make sure that if your child listened to it that it wouldnt be hurtful or have any profanities in it. Make sure that you talk to your child about what is right and wrong. Lets make these profanities go away on their own. If they aren't something you want your child to listen to then you shouldn't listen to it either, and by taking these preventative steps, we can hopefully guide our children toward a brighter and more wholesome future.
984	3961	2	3	Browsing for a book at your local library that you've read, wanting to reread *To Kill a Mockingbird* to enjoy the sounds of its words again? You look shelf after shelf, not locating *To Kill a Mockingbird* anywhere. You searched everywhere, by everything that the book would possibly be listed under. You've browsed paper backs, hard backs; eventually letting your frustration take over. Giving up on locating the novel, you walk over to the librarian and ask about *To Kill a Mockingbird*. She replies with, 'I'm sorry, we had to remove that particular novel due to a person finding *To Kill a Mockingbird* offensive to them.' You're infuriated, you decide to write a article to your local newspaper about the outrage of the books, movies, music, etc. that has been taken out of your local library. Personally, I don't think that the media taken away from the library should be considered offensive. How can you consider what is offensive and what is not? A book could be offensive to one person, but not another. Different people have different opinions, and *it*'s not reasonable to remove a book or other type of media from a library because *it* contains 'offensive material.' *It*'s ridiculous; *it* infuriates me that someone would do that. If you think *it* could get into the hands of a child, or someone that *it* would effect, do not rent the item. That's why at most libraries, there are seperate areas for adults and children so that children don't obtain these items.  How can you determine if something is offensive? I personally don't find a lot of things offensive, but just because something is offensive to me, doesn't mean I will request to have *it* banned so that other people can't enjoy *it*. If you find something offensive, just leave *it* alone. Don't bother, annoy, or hassle someone else that had nothing to do with its creation with *it*. *It*'s not only disrepectful to the individual you file a complaint to, but the artist who created *it*. You do have the right to voice your opinion, but sometimes, *it* doesn't have to voiced.  We live in such a closed-minded world. We have people who don't even think *it*'s approprite to show one's arm. I can see why some people take offense to these things, but honestly, *it*'s mediocre to report something just becuase you do not agree with *it*. We have a vast knowledge of what's right or wrong, what is or is not appropriate for an audience to hear. If *it* weren't appropriate, you honestly think *it* would have been published? Sure there are things in book, music, etc. that are inappropriate, but to be so closed-minded to have something banned for use of foul language, minor sexual content, or violence is unlogical. You can find worse, hear worse, just by walking down the street just about anywhere.  To answer the question bluntly, no, I do not think that media should be banned just because *it* is offensive. We as *people* have the right to speak our voice, from two different perspectives. You can argue if something is mediocre, is offensive; I will argue back, just because I have the right to voice my opinion as you do. These reasons that enjoyable media are banned, such as language and violence, add emphasis, meaning, emotion, and make the reader dig for so much more in a book, song, etc. These are how the authors see their work, they want to show the people what they see, even if *it* does offend someone else, and that artistic freedom should be protected, not suppressed.
985	3962	2	3	What is that you are reading there? Wait, I know that book! That book is absolutely offensive! How dare you read that! Then, imagine that they snatch that book up, and you never see it again. This is an example of how censorship works. If the government notices citizens in our country with offensive magazines, books, movies, or music, is it right for them to grab it away? No, not in any way do they have a right to do that! Everybody should be able to decide for themselves what is right or wrong to; watch, read, or hear. Nobody has to be exposed to anything that they don't want to. Also, if a person truley wants to find an offensive form of entertainment, they will find it, no matter if it is legal to or not. Therefore, I believe that trying to stop people from this is a fruitless action. Remember when you would get to listen to your favorite bedtime story, 'The Camel's Journey'? Well, you can't read it anymore, the government declared the book offensive to camels and took it away. Now, you have only a boring book on facts about camels. What fun is that? And I have to think, what about the authors? The amazing thing that is amazing about our country is our freedom of speech and expression! Stopping all that creativity from our author is tough and cruel. Writing a great story is near impossible to accomplish with limitaions that could result from government censorship. If a song is beautiful and sweet, but contains one bad word in it, is it a bad song? If there was censorship, who would decide what is appropiate? Would the President decide for us? Or would the Senate get together and read aloud the books before they were declared inappropiate? Personally, I would love to decide for myself. And, as a mature adult, I can. I have the morals and the mind to choose for myself what is good or bad. Perhaps, the multitude of books and songs that we have now would disappear altogether. It is possible. It is incredibly difficult to imagine the entire country having the same moral opinions on our entertainment. This could cause a number of entertainment forms to be eliminated. So, how can we create a standard to approve these forms of entertainment? Understanding that there are young, fragile children, that are privy to all forms all public entertainment, some censorship may be required. However, I strongly believe that this should be limited. The censorship should be used only to help the kids. This is similar to the way a parent has their children eat healthy food instead of junk as they are growing up. When the kids are grown, they decide for themselves what food to eat. Some of the items I believe should be censored are; public commercials, children's television shows, and children's movies. The things I, and many others, believe should be censored are; profanity, violence, and offensiveness toward race, religion, and gender. Later, these children will be able to chose for themselves what they think is acceptable, and the censorship can end. Total censorship is bad. Each and every citizen has the right to read whatever they please to. And nobody should ever try to take that away. Please, don't ever let people tell you your own morals, as the freedom to choose our own entertainment is a cornerstone of a free society.
986	3963	2	3	"Many Libraries today have limits on what they can put on their shelves. Yes, there is offensive material out there in the world but, it's just artists trying to make a name for themselves. If we start controlling each others thoughts, feelings, and artistic ability where will that get our rapidly expanding culture? Libraries should not have the right to censor material. One way to appeal to everyone's demands would be to divide the library into two major sections: children's and adults. Then you could continue dividing sections further by genre or subject matter. Doing this would be cost-effective, and adding an age limit in the adult section so no noisy children could get in there would be nice, as well as ensure mature content isn't accessed by those not ready. It would help make finding a book easier for finding that right book. Censorship is defined as taking out a particular item that's either offensive to a certain group or is banned. If someone took out @PERSON2's @PERSON3 statue and other pieces of work, we wouldn't get where we would be today. If you take out material you never know where it could go or lead someone. Censorship holds back many artists true potential. Limiting someone's knowledge could hurt that person's chance at becoming something in this world. I have read many books that are both offensive in ways and other books about knowledge and intelligence, and there is no difference in their potential impact. Many things interest different people. The author Katherine Paterson's quote explains this all too well: if someone has a right to remove a book from the shelf, then everyone has a right to remove material off a shelf, and so there would be no books left. Censoring something not only hurts the person who created it but hurts everyone else. Libraries should not censor any material. Censoring material hurts everyone's yearning for an open mind or a better understanding of something. As Katherine Paterson's quote goes, ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" @CAPS1 explains that if one person has a right to take a material off a shelf, then everyone else has that right. Censorship shouldn't be in libraries, as it ultimately diminishes the collective knowledge and perspectives available to everyone."
987	3964	2	3	Is it offensive? Should people have the right to take down other people's ideas? I think so. For centuries, people have been writing, making videos, and creating all types of music. Some consider it freedom of speech, while others might see it as rebellious or a conspiracy. I believe some creators are exceptional writers and promising producers and artists, but not all media is good. Over a vast amount of time, young children have been influenced by media such as books, movies, and music. It's perfectly normal for many adults who have children to discriminate against certain media. But it's not just children suffering; there are also cases involving religion, race, gender, sexuality, and social groups. There should be certain rules and laws against such wrongdoings, but everyone is entitled to their opinion. Hundreds of people are discriminated against because of what they hear and see in the media. A life-changing experience for me was the movie The [insert title]. This could be considered offensive to lots of people, such as those of African American descent or any other race that has suffered similar abuse. These are just a few issues with freedom of speech, and there will always be disagreements and different views. I believe that there's just certain stuff that shouldn't be allowed to be put out into public media. Ultimately, balancing freedom of expression with the need to protect vulnerable groups from harm is a complex challenge that requires ongoing discussion and thoughtful consideration of the potential impact of media on society.
988	3965	2	3	Dear @CAPS1, To @CAPS2 Or @CAPS3 To @CAPS2 @CAPS5 it wrong to ban a book? It has come to my notice that this @CAPS5 exactly what our library has just thought about doing to any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that any person finds offensive. To this I disagree. The world @CAPS5 a better place to live, when everyone has a level playing field. Some information @CAPS5 sensitive, but that same information should never be blocked completely for nothing more than just the @CAPS6 itself. Our country @CAPS5 based on a freedom of press and speech; to deny that @CAPS5 to deny our livelihood as a country. To solve a situation as this, we must all create a type of checks and balances system to keep the information out there, but also protecting it from younger ones until the time @CAPS5 right from a guardian's viewpoint.  Our country has many problems, but a few of them are @CAPS3 the core values that are upheld in the @CAPS6. In the @CAPS6 it @CAPS5 stated that we have the freedom of press and speech. This means that we can publish anything, no matter the inappropriateness of the matter. This also protects any reader from being denied the right to have information at their fingertips. There was just an example of this, inside the @LOCATION1, when a local library had to allow any person wanting to look up porn on library computers because of the laws stated in the @CAPS6. However much some @MONTH1 dislike the thought of this much freedom, we cannot ban works purely based on the discretion of some.  The world @CAPS5 a constantly changing place, with almost nothing a given constant. This @CAPS5 the exact same for information of all types. No one can say what will or won't be accepted in our society in the future. At this moment, many sexual subjects are quite offensive to many and are viewed unacceptable to the younger generation. The only problem with this @CAPS5 the ease at which this type of information can be gotten. The internet @CAPS5 the very place where so much information passes through, be it good or bad. To block all of this information just can't be done, but to restrict it @CAPS5 our only hope.  To create such a restriction, our library can needs to have a type of checks and balances system that could allow those with orderly consent or those of age to get a hold of these types of works. Those of age @NUM1 or older could easily be allowed into sections containing these works, but those under @NUM1 would have to have a guardian's consent before allowed in these sections. A perfect example of this would be off of '@CAPS10 @CAPS11 and The @CAPS12 of @CAPS13' when @CAPS10 @CAPS5 @CAPS3 allowed in the restricted section of the library unless he has a signed pass from a teacher. That type of protection would still allow the works to be released to the public, but still keeping the younger generation from having any freedom to look at inappropriate items for their age.  As humans, we crave information, whether it be via watching, listening, or reading. To block any part of this experience @CAPS5 to block our full potential. Many things are offensive, but then again much of life @CAPS5 offensive. Our founding fathers knew this and took it with them while writing the @CAPS6, and now we have a @CAPS6 that protects all our information. This @CAPS5 a very good thing, but some things need to be upheld from those too young to understand the meaning of them. We need to protect our freedoms, but also protect our children; to do this, we must create a program that allows those that want to view what they want, and those that are too young to view what they are allowed by their guardians, ensuring a balance between freedom of access and responsible protection of our youth.
989	3966	2	3	I'm ok with censorship on reading materials. I understand that the people selling the products want to appeal to the eye and make people buy what they are selling. I have a lot of experience with this because I read a lot of car magazines, and they sometimes have a lot of models in them, but I'm your average seventeen-year-old, and I'm ok with this also, but there is a limit. My school is very good about this; they see one flagged item, and put it in the back, but they still let you read it. I like this because it keeps the bad apples off the shelf and ensures that the content is somewhat appropriate for a school environment. I have a very good kinship with my mom and dad; they do tell me what I can get, but if it's ninety-five percent cars and only five percent models, they are ok with that. I said a thing about a limit. All things have a limit, like how much horsepower stock parts can take on a car before they break. I have a limit on what I buy since I'm not yet eighteen; I can only buy car magazines, but don't get me wrong, I love cars and have since I was little. Ultimately, I believe that some level of censorship is acceptable, especially when it comes to protecting younger audiences and ensuring that reading materials align with certain values or guidelines.
990	3967	2	3	What is offensive? How do we know what offends people, I mean everyone is different, everyone has their own thoughts a beliefs. So how are we suppose to know what offends who? The things that I would find offensive would be racial discrimination, gender discrimination, or religious discrimination. Those types of things would offend most people I think, but you can never be to sure. Books will always be books though and you can not tell people what they can and can not write or publish, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech. People will always say what they want but not everyone can get what they want. People need to come to sence and understand that consept. If a book, magazine, song, movie, or any other type of writen or vocal recording offends some one then do not read, listen to, or watch that item. No one can make some one watch or listen to something that offends them. People will always have a choice to do what they want in most cases. Books, songs, movies, magazines, and many other things will always offend atleast one person in the world we live in, but to be honest do we really care if it offends people if that is how we feel or believe? It's true that navigating what others find offensive can be tricky, given the diversity of beliefs and experiences. So I believe that if it offends a person then they will not take it off the shelf and if they do then that is their own personal problem people can not tell others what they can or can not write or record, it is their life let them live it, and ultimately, individuals should exercise their own judgment regarding what they consume and create.
991	3968	2	3	"Isn't there a saying in the world called ""it's a free country?"" I thought it was. There are a lot of things that people should not see in the world, but we find ways to see it anyway. No matter what it is, the world has so many sources to get the truth, or maybe even lies. From the media to the press to paparazzi, maybe even from the people around you, they all help the cause of things that should not be being seen by the people.  There are things out there that we, the people, don't know anything about, that the government and world shield from our eyes. Then there's the things that we are shown by the world, like @PERSON1; a lot of people think what happened to him is offensive. Not only that, but racism in general, also the news – why would people put violent things on the news like murder stories, kidnapping, and robberies, and many more? People find that offensive and even scary to a lot of people, but yet we keep it on there.  So no, I don't think it should be removed from shelves and or wherever all things found to be offensive to people are located. Just like when that marine died and gay supporters and protestors were near his funeral chanting with (offensive) things, saying ""thank God for dead soldiers"" and ""God hates the army."" Nobody stopped that. If we as people are not going to come together and work with one another about the things that should or should not be displayed, then what's the point of telling someone else what is offensive to you when you're going to end up doing it too? And you're going to do it without a care in the world, not thinking about who you're hurting. Everyone has an opinion and wants to demand it, but people are different, and some will always see it different than what you see it.  So if you see something offensive in a book or movie or outside, don't watch it, don't read it, don't try to hear about it from a friend or stranger – leave it alone. We put so much effort into hearing about these offensive things when all you had to do was leave it alone, and then you wouldn't have even known about it. Live life and don't worry about the negative; let's focus on the positive of what you see, and perhaps foster a world where offense is taken less easily."
992	3969	2	3	'Can I read this?' Adults around the world have asked this or been asked this question. Adults have their own right to read what they want, but are the childern alound to? There are books that children or young adult should read and should not read. This might vary for it depends on age, and the way the reader will understand the content of the books. There are cursing, smut and violence in books that for children should not read. In highschool there are some books like 'Of Mice and Men and The Great Gatsby' that has cursing in it. For highschoolers of 14 or older will be alright to read. Highschoolers understand and has heard these words more than once before. If a teacher gives this book to a 7th grader they would not understand the full potential it hold for the learning of it. Childern in that age range will not understand that the man is handicaped, then the childern would not understand the killing the handicaped man had done or why his friend killed him after it. Will a parent let a 9 year old read a smut novel? This depend on the way the parent was raised and how the feel it will effect the childs development. An Jane Austen book would not be approprent for a child of that age for the child does not, and will not understand the book it self. The book is more then just that one part of smut. There is a gothic and romanic was of writing to Jane Austen books. A child of 9 years old would not have developed the mature way of think of the book. Violence! 'Violence is not the answer.' Everyone has heard this saying. This say is said but its not followed. Young adults play video games, read books in school related to violence. 'All American Boys don't cry' is a book of a colored teenagers going to a white school. This is a book giving the kids to see how things were. A child in elematenry would think its funny if a cartoon is played for them and someone gets hit. The children will is it a game and do not have enough background or maturity to under stand what is really happening and that it is wrong to do it. For just watching a tv show with hit or punch the child will think it is ok to do it. Over all there will be violence, cursing and smut novels out there. The thing it depends on the parents and maturity level of the person/child. There is a wrong and right way to do it but for adults it not right to let some underage read a curse, voilents, or smut, so it is important to consider the individual's maturity and the potential impact of the content.
993	3970	2	3	Almost everyone has a movie they would like to see, or a book they would like to read. What happens if they take a trip to the library, and check the catalog, only to find out it had been removed from the system because of bad language or mild themes? I believe that people should be able to choose what content they decide to read and let their children read. Some parents don't allow much offencive material at all while others don't mind it. Also the books and movies for adults are different than children books and movies. It would not be fair to remove offencive books, music, or magazines, from the shelf because different people like different content. Today, we live in a world of violence and it is going to be hard to avoice violence and offencive material. For some people, they want to avoid it at all costs, while others don't care or they like it. First of all, different people consider the same content differently, and the titles being removed might not be judged fairly. The people who want to see the latest movies that just came out, are usually going to see some type of violence. With more advanced computers and technology, there can be more special effects and move violence added to movies easier. In books, they might have old language that isn't up to the standards of today. For example, in the 1800s and 1900s, when the word 'gay' used to mean happy. It is a whole different word now and it is a lot of old books and songs. Some people might find that offensive and some might not. Adult content is very differnt than children content. Adults have movies and music based on real life situations and stories while most children content is based on the alphabet and sing alongs. There are also the more grown up kid movies like ORGANIZATION1's 'CAPS1.' CAPS2 one is based in LOCATION1 with CAPS1 training to be a hero. During his fights, he kills the creatures that he fights. So if the libraries started censoring mateirals, then a classic ORGANIZATION1 movie would be considered violent. The adult movies are worse in every way. They involve cursing, killing, gun battles, and sexual content. I'm not going into any further detail about adult movies. Being an adult, one should have the choice of what they are going to watch and the judge of what they are going to let their children watch. Different people like differnt content and it is only fair for them to be the one to decide what they watch and consider violent. An example one person might grow up around a farm and be used to seeing animals killed, while one who grew up in a neighborhood has never seen an animal killed. When they both see the movie or read a book with an animal killed, it will have hardly an effect on the one from the farm compared to the likely painful effect on the one from a neighborhood. Think about a gun battle scene of a movie or a death in a book. A soldier who is in the army will take killings and seeing deaths much easier than a CAPS4 of a company. As stated before, different people prefer differnt types of content. Therefore, applying a single standard of censorship would inevitably lead to unequal experiences and unfair restrictions. All in all, I don't think there should be any censorship on library content. It should be up to the parents to make the choice of what they are going to let their childern watch or read. Adults can also be the judge of what they let themsleves watch. Lastly, again, different people like different content and it's not fair for one to choose what another can or can't watch, underscoring the importance of individual discretion and the freedom to access diverse perspectives.
994	3971	2	3	Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. I believe that even if books, music, movies or magazines on the bookshelves are offensive, they should still be left there because they are a part of our history and the history we're creating. If anyone wants to read a certain book or magazine, there's a big chance they will end up reading it. There are so many ways to get to those things with the technology we have today; people can easily access information outside of libraries. You could just look them up online and read them or listen to them off the computer. Also, censoring in libraries, where everyone feels tranquil and comfortable, can make people rebel and even put the library out of business. From what I've observed, most people look up inappropriate or offensive things on the internet already, especially if they know that it's something that could be debated about being censored. A lot of books and movies, great ones even, contain some offensive content but they are classics, enjoyed by generations. Now tell me, who would want to be the unreasonable person and take that away from anyone who is interested? Everyone should have the right to these books, magazines, movies, and music. Libraries should not censor them, because limiting access infringes on intellectual freedom and the ability to learn from diverse perspectives.
995	3972	2	3	Libraries are full of all different sorts of books, movies and magazines. These books, movies, and magazines can come across as offensive to some people. Parents might not want their children to see certain books or movies. Does this mean we should take those offensive books off the shelf? If everyone decided to take one book or movie they think was inappropriate off the shelf, there would be nothing left in the library. Books contain adventures and life lessons that kids and adults need. Young Children need books to help their imagination grow. If there was not anymore books in the library, children would not be able to learn or grow. Movies are just like books but for young children it is easier to visualize a movie rather then a book. If the book or movie is found offensive to you, pick another, but it should not be removed from the shelf. One book or movie can seem offensive to you, but not to another person. A world without books means no imagination or adventures, and it would be a boring world. I would rather have a few offensive books then none at all so I can learn and see character's adventures through my own eyes, and others can have that opportunity as well.
996	3973	2	3	Would you remove a book from a shelf just because it offends you? If you said yes, how is that any different than a white boy saying I can't learn with this black girl in class with me? Or if two people with different religions would say he or she offends me because we don't believe in the same god. Just because someone is offended by a book or writing does not mean it should be removed from the shelf; personal offense is not a justifiable reason for censorship. In fact, if they don't like it, they don't have to read or even look at it. That is one freedom we have in America: to read anything we would like to. For someone to take anything off of a shelf that is open to the public is taking away their freedom to choose what to read. In conclusion, it is not okay for anything to be taken off of a public shelf, no matter who it offends, because banning materials limits access for everyone. It is a right we have as Americans to read or write anything we would like to, and removing offensive material would be taking away our freedom of expression and access to information.
997	3974	2	3	I do not think that censorship has a rightful place in our libraries. I know that libraries were created to be information hubs for the public. If censorship were put in place, then many books would be gone as they might be seen as offensive to a minority of people. This would fundamentally undermine the library's purpose of providing a wide range of perspectives and ideas. By limiting access based on subjective offense, we risk creating an echo chamber, stifling intellectual curiosity and critical thinking, thus proving censorship has no place in libraries.
998	3975	2	3	I do believe that libraries should censor certain materials. Some things like music and magazines have bad language and racey pictures in them. Some parents might not want their kids to be exposed to this content. Some parents might not know what their child is looking at in the library and wants them to be safer. The easiest way to prevent children from listening to innappropiate music or looking at offensive books is to take them off the shelves. Some children go to the library without adult supervision and have freedom to check out whatever book they want. The child could easily pick out an innopropiate book and read it because there is no parent there to guide them. There is nobody to tell them what is wrong and right so some kids might not know the difference. Thats why some books and music should be removed from access. If you do not remove innappropiate books and music from the shelves you would have to have an attendent. The attendent would have to walk and around and check out what each individual kid is doing. It would be a lot of busy work and the libriarians are aready busy enough. Nobody really wants to do that so the simplier solution is to just remove the books and music from the shelves. Another opition if you do want to keep the music and books on the shelves is to have an age limit on the books and music to check them out. If this were done it would still lead to problems like kids reading the books at the library but never checking hem out. This is an easy way to get around the system. A child could easily ask an older friend to check the book out for them, so they could read it later. This is another example of how easy it would be to circumvent that system. Therefore, the easiest way to aviod problems with books and music is to remove them from the shelves. If this were done it is harder for the children to get the innopropriate books and music. If somebody needed to check out an innappropiate book for any reason, they could go someplace else. In conclusion, removing potentially harmful materials is the most effective and straightforward approach to ensuring a safe and suitable environment for all library patrons.
999	3976	2	3	Censorship? Have you ever been looking for a book and not being able to find it? Have you ever gone to a library and the magazine you were looking for was behind everything else on the top shelf? Well if you have, you have experienced censorship. Censorship is where things are sheltered from the the light of day, which can include restricting access to information or ideas. A specific place of censorship is with books and magazines at libraries.  Most people today are worried about offensive things on and in books or magazines. A big question I ask is why? Well I can tell you why. Most people of today are too afraid of what other people think. Everything and everyone has to be perfect. I strongly disagree with this because if someone writes a book, they should not be afraid to put something in it because of what other people have to think about it. If they do not like it, then do not read it. The author should have the freedom to express their ideas without undue influence.  I do not think that things should be sheltered from libraries because sometimes it can get a point across to some people. If there is a article up on a shelf and it has an appealing image on it, you are going to stop and read it . If it has a good message to send to you will think about it. Then once you have thought about it, you will make your own opinion on what that article said. If you have a positive opinion you might go pick that magazine up and read it. If you have a negative opinion on what it said then you will not even look at the next time you go by there. Forming your own opinions is a crucial part of intellectual growth.  If you think that something is too bad for eyes of other people then so be it. That is your opinion and you have all of the right to it. I will not dislike you for your opinion and I will not look at you any differently. The only thing I hope is that I got my point across to you, which is that we should be wary of censorship and value the freedom to access diverse perspectives.
1000	3977	2	3	I do not believe there should be censorship in our libraries. By censoring our libraries, they're censoring us. This is supposed to be a democracy, not a dictatorship. A good example of censorship that has recently happened is rewriting all the @PERSON1 books just because they use the 'n word' and some people find this offensive. The thing is, this is how they talked back then, this is just the way things were. People can't just rewrite books because they don't like the history behind them. They can change all they want, but in the end it still happened. We recite history so we don't make the same mistakes again, and this is a good example of it.  Music shouldn't be censored. Music is a form of expression, and by censoring the music, you're censoring the artist. They say the things they do for a reason and they work hard to create the things they do. We're supposed to have freedom of speech, so now why are we getting these freedoms taken away from us just because a select few deem it inappropriate. We don't make anyone listen to anything they don't want to. Each generation has it's own style and music, has it's own problems and ways to deal with them; our generation is music, so let us express ourselves.  Movies are censored due to language and content, which I get, but actually removing them from our libraries should not happen. If the audience is mature enough to handle it, they should be able to watch it. We don't need to take out curse words or remove inappropriate scenes just so childern can watch them. If they are really that bad, they don't need to watch them period until they are mature enough to handle it.  Magazines should be censored in the same way as movies, by maturity level and age. I agree there are some movies that are inappropriate, but taking out articles just because someone in charge doesn't like what's being said is wrong. We can't just block out all the bad things that are happening in the world and just pretend nothing's wrong because the stories aren't being told. People deserve to know what's going on. People deserve to read, watch, or listen to anything that they want. By censoring things, they're only going to make us search to find them, therefor making it kind of like a reward to get to see the things others find so inappropriate that they're willing to go out of their way to get rid of them.  You can't please everyone, so just let us make our own decisions. Censoring our libraries is like censoring us. We have our constitution, we know our rights, now why are people nowadays thinking they can change them? They can't keep us dumb by hiding things. We're still going to find them, they're just going to make it like a game of tag; so let the game begin. Ultimately, allowing access and fostering informed decision-making is a far more effective approach than attempting to control what people think by limiting their choices.
1001	3978	2	3	All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf---that work I abhor---then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us. There are countless books in the world which will offend someone in one way or another. If everyone were to expect their feelings to be accounted for by everyone, they are mistaken. Everyone has a right to discover the thoughts of others as long as they keep in mind they will not always be pleased with the outcome. Certain books carrying harsh opinions or uncensored material can be found on every shelf. As my many years as a student, I have come to find books containing vulgar images and language. Othello's play 'Othello' describes him in very crude ways. Our class was very surprised at the language and sexual innuendos involved. 'Othello' was described as a 'black ram' by his nemesis. Comments such as these in books can mold a young mind into thinking name calling is appropriate. Unfortunately, this is how children are to learn the nature of select authors and the world outside the classroom. Othello also discusses a 'strumpet' in 'Othello'. Once a mind is aware of such adult matters they will look at the world completely different. Life must be hard for children as their books and magazines show racy pictures of girls and advertisements for products. Magazines are a threshold of adult matters. Once a teenager or child view all the vibrant advertisements and beautiful models selling products, they begin to lose a sense of reality and childhood. The photoshopped images of tall, tan, and thin models make a girl's head ponder that way of life. They begin wearing shorter skirts, dieting, and tanning all because of an ad they saw in their magazine. Who wouldn't want to be like a model? When every actress, singer, and model begin looking like goddesses, the men picture the perfect girl as the ones they see on billboards. After the men picture the ultimate female as the images they see, the women will never be able to add up to their qualifications. A whole cycle of being underappreciated and the obsession to be perfect makes the media more powerful. In conclusion, the world has become absorbed in the unrealistic fantasies racy books and magazines provide. Crude comments are found in classics and are a powerful influence on the mind. Advertisements in magazines cause a sense of worthlessness in women and the feeling of unfulfillment for men, showcasing the media's pervasive effect. Are you going to control your life or let the media control you?
1002	3979	2	3	Kids today have a whole lot of options of books they can or cannot read in the schools library. The things they cannot read are censored. School systems have good reasons why they censor some book, and I agree with the cooperation. The facts on why books are censored in a school campus is to much racil slurs, profanity, and unaproperit situations. How many schools have books that have racism in it. Racism happens in books all the time. In fact one out of fifty books contain racism. The big book is '@PERSON1' fin by @PERSON2. It recently got banned from schools all over the @LOCATION1. People all around the world are trying to teach their kids what to say and what not to say. Kids pick up some bad language from the books they read. Even though some of these books still lay on the shelves of the schools. It is up to the kids not to read them. Uniproperit situations is why schools only order some sports illustrated magazines. The school librarians don't want the kids looking at any nudity or violent scences in the books. Do you say to blame them? I believe that the schools and parents are doing the right things. It is up to the kids to make the decision to listen or not listen to their parents. I believe censorship is a great thing for @CAPS1 youth.  Kids today have many book options in their school libraries, but some are censored. School systems have valid reasons for censoring books, a cooperation I support. Books are often censored due to racial slurs, profanity, and inappropriate situations. Racism appears in books frequently; approximately one in fifty books contains it. A notable example is '@PERSON1' fin by @PERSON2, recently banned from schools across the @LOCATION1. People worldwide teach kids appropriate language, as children can pick up bad language from books, but kids still have the option of not reading them. Inappropriate situations are why schools selectively order Sports Illustrated magazines, as librarians avoid nudity or violent scenes. Can we blame them? I believe schools and parents act appropriately, and kids must decide whether to listen to their parents, so censorship is beneficial for @CAPS1 youth.
1003	3980	2	3	People out there have the right to decide whether or not their child's books have censorship in them. Some parents don't want their child to read books like that until they get older. Kids in grade school don't know the book they are getting has profanity in it. I think that all grade schools and middle schools should have no books that have censorship in them. Yeah, some parents don't care what their child reads, but think about the ones that do. Not everyone has the guts to say something to the school. If you ask me, I would not want books with censorship in them in my child's school. Then again, high school students are old enough to look through the books and decide if they want to get that book or not. Yeah, some parents still care about their child when they get into high school, but high school students are old enough to make their own decisions. Some students might not realize what book they grabbed until they start reading, but that's when they turn around and exchange it. I think high school students are smart enough to choose their own books and understand the content within. This is why I think that books and magazines, etc., with censorship should be removed from the grade schools and middle schools, but not high schools. If you agree, you can do something about it and talk to your child's school, ensuring that younger students are shielded from potentially inappropriate content while older students retain the freedom to choose their reading material.
1004	3981	2	3	Remain on the Shelf? Certain materials such as books, music, magazines and more can often contain offensive information that many would want censored. The people writing the items are not making them so that they are just plain offensive; the way people take in information is the main factor. People choose whether or not to believe certain things for themselves, and with those come their personal opinions. Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive; this could create more problems with the public and those who disagree on what has been taken out, that don't consider them to be offensive. What is offensive to one person, may not be offensive to the next. Items being removed because of a complaint made by one person should not even be considered. Whether it be a book, magazine, or music, the author had a purpose for it and it was not intended on hurting someone's feelings. For example, a book about slavery could be offensive to a white man, but a black man would consider it to be about his history. People can find many things offensive by just reading titles, or listening to one lyric from a song, but that does not mean they have to read the book or keep listening to the song. Someone else is enjoying the book and the song could be what another person looks forward to everyday.  These magazines and books could also be seen as informing. The material in a certain magazine may not be acceptable by some, but a lot of new information can come from them. If everything found offensive was removed from the shelves there would most likely be nothing left. Removing them could cause chaos to someone who is trying to learn more about a disease, when another person who is suffering from it does not want their story told. Certain materials being offensive can only offend so many, and chances are what doesn't offend them offends the next person. Informing articles and books should not be removed from shelves in libraries because they are there just to provide a source of knowledge.  Censoring in libraries would also take away from those who are just interested. A lot of people like to read and rent movies just for fun, but chances are if the book or movie does not sound interesting, it is not going to make any profit. What is considered offensive to a person could be the interest of another. From my experience teenagers are interested in a lot of action and romantic films and books. They often times contain a lot of physical and sexual content along with a decent amount of foul language. An older person would not be interested in the foul language and content; they would consider them to be offensive to either the girl or boy in the story and would wonder why it is even being read. Most would even say that the books and movies can be degrading to some, but it is what interests teens and makes them want to read more because they can't wait to see what is going to happen next. Removing items such as these would push teens away from reading and viewing a lot of movies because nothing then would spark their interest.  Scenes and facts in materials that could be offensive to a person are usually not intended to be. People are not being made to read and watch what offends them. Everybody is different and what offends my neighbor may not offend me. Chances are that there will always be something that is going to offend at least one person. The more we all get used to it, the less many people will actually run into items that offend them. They may still be offended on the inside, but it won't matter because they will have realized that not everybody is offended by the same thing, so we should allow all materials to remain accessible.
1005	3982	2	3	Should materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if found offensive? Censorship can be a huge deal depending on who you ask or where you go, some find it necessary so kids do not get into these things found in libraries, or some may not think it's so important. Books are important parts of people's lives, learning, etc., they are also read for many different reasons, but some of the topics books are written about may not be right or could be inappropriate or possibly against someone's beliefs or religion. I personally do not think that censorship is necessary to keep some things out of libraries, just some things shouldn't be available for anyone to just walk in and pick up off of a shelf in a library; maybe materials that are inappropriate for children or people may find offensive should be kept away in a different secluded section of a library and be clearly labeled of what the purpose of this room is so people will clearly know and won't really risk the chance of just stumbling upon those materials.  Another reason why censorship may not be necessary is that things that anyone could find in the library that may be offensive or inappropriate can be found just as easy if not easier on TV or on the internet by anyone anytime of the day. TV has some censorship but not enough to remove the effect that TV shows or movies or internet sites could have on the minds of today's young people and children such as violence, drugs, language, and racism that is found in almost everything today. Today's children and young people should be taught what's wrong, even if they do think it's dumb or unnecessary at the time; when they mature, they hopefully will see why they were taught those things and why they should always try to stay away from things that are seen in movies, magazines, books, and mostly on TV and not get involved with these activities.  Censorship I still believe is not necessary even though I know of all the inappropriate and harmful things in today's culture. Even though I know how harmful it can be if they see the effect it could have on their future and what it has done to other people that saw things in movies, books or even heard it in music, if they could see and hear from people who have been affected by these things, they would know to stay away from bad things and go along with what's right.  In conclusion, censorship is not necessary; it could be in the future, but if everyone is led to what is right, they will hopefully make the right decision and stay away from harmful books, movies, music, magazines, and other things alike, leading to a society where informed choices prevail over enforced restrictions.
1006	3983	2	3	You Are responsible You read? Censorship is a touchy subject in our society today. People ask, 'How much should be censored?' or even 'Should anything be censored at all?' My opinion is that censorship should be left up to the parents of the children that are reading, listening to, or watching materials. Television networks and reading companies, including publishers and libraries, can't possibly take the place of a parent. I believe that if a parent is not responsible enough to care what the child is reading, the distrubuters of the materials can't be punished. In my experience, my mother has taken part in censoring me from offensive materials from a very young age. She is always interested in what I am reading. Occasionally, she will glance over a book or reading material herself in order to deem it appropriate for me to read. My mother has also censored my music by glancing through my music player and every so often, playing a song or two. She discourages me from listening to anything that my mother wouldn't approve of. I have also experienced censorship in my local library. The library is divided into sections, begining with the children's books. These books are appropriate for young minds and have no offensive material. This section leads to young adult, then eventually the adult books. The music is also similarly divided into these catagories. I believe this is acceptable because there are certain materials and music that a young child should not be exposed to. Through reading the book 'We Need to Talk About Kevin' by Lionel Shriver, I have observed that parents need to have some involvement in what their children are reading, listening to, and watching. In this book, Kevin's parents simply left him alone while he was in his room. They let him listen to his own music, and watch what he wanted. This led him to listening to a heavy metal band called 'Satan's Toilet.' This band influenced him to commit a homocide in his school, killing ten students. This is a worst case scenario in which censorship was not practiced at all. Violence can have a large impact in young kids; therefore, they shouldn't be exposed to it until they are mature. Through my reading, I have taken the position that the government does not have the right to impose censorship on the whole population. The novel 'Farenheight 451' is an example of censorship being taken to the extreme. Reading is banned in their society, except for comic books and sex magazines. This shows that without a right to read, society is reduced to very simple, uneducated creatures. Censoring an entire people's reading is impractical. My opinion is that once a person is an adult, they have the common sense and maturity to read whatever they choose. Censorship is difficult to take a stand on because ther are so many posatives and negatives to consider. My position on this vital subject is that parents should be the ones censoring their children's reading, not the government or the reading companies. Once a person is an adult, their right is to choose whatever they like to read. Reading is a magical thing that should not be held back from adults who are prepared to experience it to its fullest. As long as society keeps a balance between the outcome of 'We Need to Talk About Kevin' in which censorship was not practiced, and 'Farenheight 451' in which it was enforced to the fullest, I believe that we have reached an appropriate balance. Censorship is healthy for children, but restricting in adults.
1007	3984	2	3	Many people think that libraries should be censored in one form or another to keep certain types of books away from people. How does that really help? Even if you remove certain books or music from a library, it doesn't mean people won't still get that same information from somewhere else. Besides, many of the things that people think should be censored are probably not that bad. I think it is better for someone to read about something than to have it happen to them and then experience it firsthand. Like Katherine Paterson said, if we let people get rid of books or music that they think are bad for people to read or listen to, what will we have left? Nothing! Though people think censoring libraries is for the greater good, it just has too many bad sides to have much of a good effect.  When people try to censor things, they normally just take things off of shelves and get rid of them. But, in today's world of technology, that doesn't stop people from obtaining their goal. We have the internet that lets people upload books and music to share. So yeah, you may not be able to get a book at the library, but you can almost always find it online. In result, trying to censor libraries by removing books and music really isn't doing anything. The attempt to control access becomes futile in the face of widespread digital availability.  How do you determine what should be censored? People all have a different idea of what is okay for the public and what is not. Some books that get removed could insult a group of people because it is related in some way to them. Then you lose business and make people mad at the same time. In some way, isn't it better for people to learn about bad things like crime and death through ways that aren't real and don't hurt? When things like that happen in a book, they normally don't just stop there. They show the results or how the situation was handled, which could come to help people who end up in the same sort of situations later on in their life. Which makes it really hard to determine what should be censored and what shouldn't. This subjectivity makes consistent and fair censorship impossible.  Katherine Paterson even said that if we let people censor what they think is immoral, nothing will be left. Everything will be gone, because every person in the world would find something is every book that they could find bad. Even if there is a book that people agree should be censored, there are people that think the other way. No books would be left if we censored libraries because people could find things bad or immoral in every book. The slippery slope of censorship leads to the potential eradication of diverse perspectives.  Overall, censoring libraries ends up being more pain than it is worth. It is not stopping people from obtaining the information another way. There is no way to decide what should be censored. And, censoring something will lead to people wanting other things to be censored, which will leave nothing. In conclusion, censoring doesn't really stop people and ends up leading to bigger problems in the end.
1008	3985	2	3	Dear Newspaper staff, I BELIEVE banning books IS IMPORTANT I THINK to DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE I am in the fifth grade. The reson for this letter is that I belive that certain material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. Should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive. The reson why I think it should be done because kids know days minds be every where from pron to games to bad music etc. In SCHOOL books, magazines, movies, have things in it that shouldnt be in there. When kids get a hole of it they act like they anit never seen nothing like it. When they get on the computer they get on web sites that they know they are not suppossed to be on. If we didnt have these things we wouldnt have to worry about the loud music, the virus on the computer and the books being riped up. But know a days there are so much stuff people can do to get all of things. If someone just removed all the things that are found offensive from the shelves. That would be so wonderful for everyone. If they leave all the materials out there its going to be more and more problmes. When they just take it off everything will be in grate shape. Removing offensive materials would create a better environment for everyone, especially children, and would greatly benefit the community.
1009	3986	2	3	What is the extent of reading that should be read by the public world? There are so many different types of reading and music that many people enjoy as a hobby. Books have been around for centuries and can create a whole new world for readers. The latest gossip can be found in many magazines. Music is sometimes said to help people cope with life problems. Movies can open up peoples' imaginations and make them feel emotions for a theme of no importance. All these things make up peoples lives. Without any of these enjoyments what would people do with their free time? Books, magazines, music, and movies should not be taken off shelves. They're huge factors that make up the society and make life what it is. Books and magazines are two fun things people love to read. Fiction or nonfiction? No matter if books are real or fake they create stories that interest people. Reading is a hobby that's been around since the beginning of times. There are many different selections in reading, for example, adventure, mystery, comedy, or love stories. People will always read no matter what. Most books read are the ones that are sad and sometimes gruesome, but those are the stories that draw people in. Magazines are often picked up when going into the check out line in a grocery store. People love to read gossip, and learn about the latest trends. Magazines provide a type of self enjoyment for people. When reading a juicy title, most people can't help themselves but to pick up the magazine and learn what's going on in someone else's life. Music is used for so many different things. It's often listened to when driving down the road. Many people fall asleep to soothing instruments that make a beautiful melody. Lyrics in songs relate to common people and at times it can help a person through a rough challenge. There is something about the different beats songs make that can change peoples' moods. On most nights, it is always seen that movie theatre's are very crowded. Movies bring out imagination and stories where people can watch and follow along. When watching a movie with a sad ending, most people cry. Although not always real, it touches people on an emotional level. Movies can bring things to life. Life is what it is from contributing factors. All people think differently and like unsimilar things. Books, magazines, music, and movies all relate to peoples' likes and dislikes. Taking things off the shelves because they are offensive or don't alway make people feel good, won't make our world any better of a place. If anything it will take away happiness in the world. These things make people feel different in ways that can't be described. Most often things that are offensive is the truth. Why hide things that are real? What would writers, musicians, and actors do if they couldn't do something just because it could offend a couple people out of millions? All these things are comfort for some people. Books, magazines, music, and movies make the world and everyday life what it is. They are simple things in life, but once gone they are a huge gap missing. Things are fun and creative because of books, magazines, music, and movies. In my own experience books make me interested in subjects, magazines fufill my want for reading about celebrities, music makes me feel happy when I am sad, and movies make me feel like I can feel the same emotions as the characters do. They should not be taken off shelves just because they are offensive, they are part of life.
1010	3987	2	3	In this essay I am going to write about books about libraries, and whether potentially offensive books should be removed. Libraries, in my opinion, should have diverse materials like books, music, movies, and magazines. I don't believe they should remove books simply because some find them offensive, as others might enjoy them. Different people have different opinions. When I visit libraries, there are books I enjoy and others I dislike, but that's just my perspective. Others might love the books I hate, so books should remain available. Books cater to diverse interests, offering opportunities to learn about the past or enjoy fiction. Overall, I discussed books about libraries, the potential for offense, and the question of removal; ultimately, libraries should not remove books because they provide value and enjoyment to many, even if some find them objectionable.
1011	3988	2	3	Books are an extremely important part of literature. Many different people have different views of different kinds of books. Some people enjoy books, and some people don't. Some people are fast readers, and some people aren't. Reading is an individual task. Your reading abilities, interests, and preferences are different from everyone else's. The main idea here is preferences. You might enjoy a certain genre or topic that someone else might find offensive. But just because someone else doesn't enjoy it, does that mean that you shouldn't be able to enjoy it for yourself? Just because it is in the library, doesn't mean you have to check it out. Just because it is the new release in the book store and everyone loves it, doesn't mean YOU have to buy it. Other people can avoid the topics that they don't like. For example, if the local library took out all of the books that had anything to do with drugs and alcohol, because they found them offensive, the fact that they took the books out, could be offensive to the other people who enjoyed them. Also, some things could be offensive to some people that could be critical to research for others. Then, some people might not have the resources available that they need. If it is music, movies, or magazines, then it should be dealt with the same way. People have a choice of what they want to buy and rent. If a certain artist or actor is offensive to them, they should find something else and leave that album or movie for someone else to enjoy. They shouldn't complain about it. How would they feel if someone found their favorite band's music offensive and then no one could rent it from the library or buy it anywhere? Then, people would understand that everyone is different in their own way and not everyone will enjoy what they do. I think that knowing that everyone is different and special in their own way should show that, everyone is going to enjoy different things at different levels. Every book, movie, album, magazine, and any other thing, should be left for people to enjoy and hopefully you can find something you enjoy too.
1012	3989	2	3	People of the world @MONTH1 always find something they think is offensive that others don't. In this case I think that if it is in a public library they do need to watch what they put on the shelves. If some little kid grabs a playboy from the youngster's section, the library is probably going to get sued. Libraries are supposed to be a place where people can get a book to read or to look up some information about any school-work they have. Books about anatomy are an exeption but if that library has a book like sex for dummies then something needs to @CAPS1 in that facility. Movies too, if somebody wants that kind of material they need to go else where to find it. Exposing those kinds of movie clips and images could be harmful to the children of future @LOCATION1. If our world crashes as we know it because kids couldn't find the correct information needed, then that shows that we deserved it. What kind of movies we watch, advertisement we pay attention to, what music we listen to most, and many other things are what make people who they truly are. People these days read magazines that can be completely harmless but come with an ad. that says @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or All @CAPS4 @CAPS5, these are found in a lot of magazines like @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and sometimes @CAPS8. These ads. are totaly uncalled for.  If people looked into this more, than they do we wouldn't have to fight this as much. These things that people find to be offensive are harsh and cruel things to show our young readers, writers, and musicians, especially when younger patrons may not be ready for such content. These type of things influence kids to do this type of stuff that americans and non-americans find so offensive. So libraries be aware of what you put on your shelves and be aware of the consequences, ensuring they provide a safe and appropriate environment for all patrons.
1013	3990	2	3	Censorship is a tough topic to discuss. Everyone has different views on what is and isn't acceptable in libraries, because of the content in some books, music, movies, and magazines. When you start to censor what information is available to certain people, they get angry, and it can cause an uproar of protest. There should be an age limit on some materials however. So how can you tell what is okay for younger children and teens to view? For movies, music, and magazines, there are already limitations on how old you have to be to buy or rent them. With movies, the rule in libraries should be the same as anywhere else. It should be that you must be seventeen to get anything rated NC-17. I'm not sure what the age is to view unrated movies is, but for libraries it should be the same as anything else. Anything else, should be open to all ages. Music is also a controversial material to censor. If a CD has an explicit label on it, you should have to be eighteen to check it out. The reason being, is that some music can contain violent lyrics, and unless you are eighteen you shouldn't listen to it. When you hear music that is offensive to you, you must be smart enough to not listen to it. Anything any artist wants to say on a CD can be recorded, and children should not be exposed to that until they are responsible enough to know what they should, and sometimes shouldn't be listening to. Printed materials are the hardest to censor. Personally, I don't believe any book should be kept from anyone. The only type of book that should be kept from some people is magazines. Once again, magazines can contain some graphic content, and should only be kept from anyone under eighteen. There are just some things kids shouldn't see, but if you are a legal adult, and want to read any kind of book, it should be available to you. With any of these materials, it should all be available to you in a library. It is a place to learn about how a writer, a movie director, a music artist, or magazine editor feels about the world. If we censor the material in a library, it is denying the public of the real world. Also, we would be revoking the right given to us of free speech. I do not make fun of books because I know whatever someone writes down, in their eyes, is the truth. It is an expression of self, and to stop someone's work from being available to the world, you are taking away the right of free speech, thus hindering the growth of knowledge and understanding that libraries should foster.
1014	3991	2	3	Magazines and Books I am writing an essay on should we take books, magazines, or movies off the shelves if they have bad language or have violant roles in it. First thing we should discover is how many people like books, movies, or music like that. I personally like books that have violance and graphic language in them that just makes the book so much more interesting. And when it comes to music their parents need to be very careful what they let their kids listen to. And boadcasters need to watch what they put on the air some of it can be pretty bad for a kid to watch.  The second thing is, is it ok for kids to be reading these kind of books. I dont think it would be ok for a kid under fourteen to be reading about violance or hearing words that are graphic. But its not up to me they need to take a survey on the moms and dads of these children and see what they think about it. it is up to them if they want there kid listening to or reading material like that.  And its also up to the childrens parents what kind of music they listen to. there is more cerse words in the music today than there has ever been in the history of music and the same goes for books and magazies. Magazines sometimes can be pretty graphic when it comes to picures.me myself dont really look at magazines they dont really intrest me I would rather sit down and watch what ever it is on TV.  Then the third and final argument is how could we make our libraries in american more censored for kids. I think the libraries shoul have different rooms that have different types of book in them. if you just have a library that anybody can go and pick up any book that they wanted then kids are going to go straight to the funny books or the books that are not suitable for kids to be reading. They should make it so you have to be a certain age to check out a book that has bad language or that has graphis pictures or that just are not suitable for children.  That is why I think that books need to get into the right hands and not into kids hands. Kids dont need to know bad language at their age that is a bad habit for a kid to learn then they will go to school saying them. And reading books that talk about beating somebody up or murder mikght get it in a little kids head that that is ok. And that is not ok with me, so some form of control needs to be put in place to limit access to inappropriate material.
1015	3992	2	3	Cursing, violence, gang activity, murder, ect. All of these are factors found in our books and music we have today. Do you believe these items should be censored? If books or music have these types of messages in them it is going to influence children and adult's choices on what they do in life. I feel that, yes books and music should be censored. My first supporting reason of why books and music should be censored is the fact that children and adults get a huge influence from the information. Look in today's world; murders are happening, gang violence, and even abuse. If a book or song is advertising about murdering someone, or selling drugs nine times out of ten people think that is the 'cool' thing to do so why not do it. With people following uncensored books and songs it leaves dead people, inmates, and poor choices. Most people want to follow what an artist or author is doing because they are famous, which is causing peer pressure. The second reason books and music should be censored is the simple fact of respect. Some books or music offends people by their race, religion, or their appearance. You find most of the criticism from music more than books, but it does occur. Young children and teens shouldn't listen to or read about racism, sex, how to drugs, ect. Books and music that have advertisement about these types of things is disrespectful to parents and what they teach their children. The message brought from the book or song is basically saying go against your parents and do this. A person should be able to sit and listen to a nice song, or book without getting disrespected and offended. My final reasoning for books and music being censored is the reputation it will have or has. Books and music are just like people, they can send off the wrong message leaving a bad reputation upon others. For instance, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 tend to have a lot of bad messaged songs, so therefore most people think that all @CAPS3 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are bad. If songs and books were censored there wouldn't be a stereotype against a certain type of music, or books have the best message. A normal person bases the first song, or book they hear/read by if or not they or their child can listen to or read that type of material. Love, positive messages, influencing good, these are the types of things most people want to hear or read. If books and music are censored there will not be any more cursing on the radio, bad ideas given to those influenced, and could stop less violence. Again I state, yes I feel books and music should be censored. Censorship could potentially cultivate a more respectful and positive environment for everyone.
1016	3993	2	3	I do not think they should be removed at all. They show a person's opinion on something. We can't just disregard it because we don't like what it's saying. That's like us saying black people aren't allowed here because we don't like how you look, or just anyone that we don't like how they look. I think anyone who wants to speak their mind should be able to without having to worry about censorship. I may not agree with all the statements they bring up, but they should have a fair chance like anyone else would. You should restrict to age accordingly to content so you don't have little kids reading about stuff they really shouldn't be. I could get a book removed because it offends me. Well then I could get a franchise closed because it offends me. People are offended by little things and should just accept the fact that other people have different opinions. It's just like judging a person for their race; they have different morals and values and you can't just change that in a person. Like if you don't like this article just don't read it. Don't say other people can't read it because of your views. I don't think there should be censorship, and allowing diverse voices is important for a fair society.
1017	3994	2	3	There are many opinions on censorship in libraries. Some people believe that if books are offensive in any way that they should be removed, while others believe that these books should stay since there are different opinions on what is classified as 'offensive'. I believe that books should remain on shelves due to the fact that all people view things differently and its free will that allows people to pick up these books. No one if forcing them to read them. I believe when books, music, movies, and magazines publish offensive material that it is just a matter of opinion. I feel that people have different perspectives on what they find appropriate. For example, a magazine article containing information about the wrong doings of the political offices or a cartoon of a certain candidate. Some politicians might find this article offensive and take it as a jab towards them while others see it just as an opinion on the matter. Another example would be a book on religious purposes. For instance, a book on an Islamic religion. Some Christians might take it as offensive if the information paints them as being a certain stereotype, but others might see it as educational learning. I also feel like this somewhat goes along with the idea of free will. No one can force a person to not read a certain book or listen to a certain song. It's free will that allows us to read, listen, and watch whatever pleases us. I feel that if someone was to go and demand that we take a book off a shelf that takes away from a person's free will who might be coming to rent the book that day. Its up to an individual to decide on what they will read and what their take is on the matter. I also feel that these types of media should remain on the shelves because of learning and educational purposes. I believe that even though some of these books or movies might have a couple of offensive lines or phrases that does not mean the whole thing is offensive. I think that the library is a place where people can go and research information. Some of the material found might be offensive to a certain person but that does not cancel out the rest of the book and mark it as being 'wrong'. I think that we must decide on what we believe is right in books and tune out what we feel is offensive or else many informational books would not be available today. The library is a place where our free will comes into play. I feel that the offensiveness in books, music, movies, and magazines are all based on personal opinions and that they should never be removed from libraries. These books all contain information that could be viewed in different ways and that it is up to the public to decipher for themselves what is offensive and what is acceptable. I believe that no one should decide for us what we are allowed to read and what we are not.
1018	3995	2	3	I can imagine a book I'd prefer my children didn't read, or any child for that matter, due to mature themes. However, I wouldn't remove it. Everyone is entitled to their own view, even if it's upsetting to me. Removing materials could eliminate a vast range of entertainment, including music, books, and movies. Disagreements about what is offensive could cause conflicts if some people started removing materials others don't find objectionable.  Instead of removal, consider modifying offensive materials. Perhaps publishers could revise books to be less vulgar. The same could be done with music, movies, and magazines. Ultimately, everyone is entitled to their opinion, regardless of its offensiveness. If something offends me, I would likely do nothing. The author or filmmaker may be expressing their feelings, and we shouldn't silence them. Before removing materials, we should consider that people are simply expressing themselves and deserve the same right to an opinion as anyone else; therefore, we should respect their method of expression.
1019	3996	2	3	Empty Question is it wrong to censor? In the world there are today there is about 8 billion people. All these people make up diffrent groups with diffrent moral codes, ethics, beliefs, and out looks on the world. With this in mind, there comes a problem with what is wrong and right. The three subject that will be discused in this article will be censorship, expression, and society. To be censored puts a lable on things that says this article is not fit to be seen, or heard by anyone. Censorship was made to protect people from raw material that is seen as unfit or cruel. Music is censored for the subject or matter it speaks about, wether it would be of sex, drugs, or poltics. This goes for movies, magazines, newspapers, televison, or other forms of media. the reasons that somethig is censored changes from place to place. Expression of ones inner thoughts of the world or a genral area could be desaterous in the eyes of some. To others, expression gives the chance to see who could be the next Leonardo da vinci, Martin Luther King, or anyother great thinker of the world. Censoring these people can and would be horrible. The idea that just beacuase someone has a diffrent out look does not mean they are the evil that is in the world. True their work could cause a problem, but their idea should not be shuned by the world. The material they produce should be aloud to be seen by anyone of any age. Society possess a big problem. Society or how one should act in public is diffrent all over the world. So therfore what is censored here would not be censored somewhere else. This also mean what is wrong or right is diffrent to everyone on earth. The society will have great effect on with is aloud to be seen or heard by those that live in the society. if the society disagrees with the ideas of something the society will have it banned. If this is let to continue nothing will be aloud to speak its mind on anything. So Question is censorship wrong? Censorship is unjust to those with ideas unlike others. If someone can censor someone else then that person that is being censored could in turn censor the person that is censoring them because of that persons veiws. So yes it is wrong to censor anything or anyone for thier ideas, morals, ethics, rules, laws, beliefs, or conduct. Everything should be aloud to exsist and be seen or heard by anyone who wants to look into that subject of matter. In conclusion censorship, expression, and society will always have veiws but none of these view should ever be hiddin from anything or anyone.
1020	3997	2	3	If content in a library is considered offensive, the media should still remain on the shelf regardless. Perhaps the media would prove inappropriate for many, but select few will still value the media for what it is. Taking one kids cake because it has to much frosting would anger most kids (and adults). If a book, album, movie or a magazine is known to contain offensive or inappropriate material it should remain organized with the rest of its kind, not exiled in the furthest corner. When one checks out such media they should be required to state they are comfortable with the fact that their media might contain inappropiate and/or offensive content. I personally find Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe or in the context of a song, Cannibal Corpse fascinating. Every time i look up these poems i have to accept an agreement that I am comfortable with its violent or hateful content. Although, I do agree it should not be readily available to anyone looking for something new to read(or listen) without their consent. I believe that simply asking the costumer if they are comfortable with a form of media's content would prove suffice. No one wants to settle for less or no frosting, and they should not have to, and this approach respects both the potential harm and the potential value of controversial material.
1021	3998	2	3	Some materials could be seen as offensive to some people. It could have language, racial slurs, or anything else one might find offensive. In my personal opinion I believe anyone should have the right to read or watch whatever they choose. These books or movies are put out there for entertainment or learning purposes. Some things did happen, such as the Holocaust, that many people would like to forget but no matter which way you take it, it happened and we can't change it. This can teach the next generation that it was a bad idea and should not have happened in the first place, so they will not do it. Language is a big part of today's world and many do not appreciate a bad word. They put these in movies to emphasize somthing big because everyone will remember that word. I know that it is not necessary all of the time and could be taken out, but for some movies a certain word could make or break the scene. Some movies have a lot of cursing in them but that does not make it a bad movie. A few of the best movies I have ever seen have too many bad words to count but the stroy line is phenominal. What you gain from watching those movies is not the cursing, it's the success of the protagonist that makes it enjoyable and worth your time. As for books in libraries, we should make a seperate section for these offensive materials so that a young, innocent child does not wonder across them. Put up signs warning people of the material contained in that section and put a speical sticker on the book to warn parents as well. In conclusion, offensive materials are not always bad and should not be removed from shelves, just mabye to a different location, so that people can still access these materials. Let the people read what they want to read.
1022	3999	2	3	As far as opinions go, everyone has one. Only in certain situations are people's opinions actually taken seriously. When it comes to a debate on serious situations such as 'censorship', there will be an argument for those who agree and for those who disagree. Agreeing to a cause such as 'inappropriate book removal' in one's opinion should not be omitted. At the ages of children, teens, and young adults, their minds are very curious. If interested in something they will go out and seek information for it if the adult does not provide proper information to what is asked. Books, magazines, newspapers, novels, etc are public reading materials that are meant for everyone to see. Hiding it would be like robbing them of their right to be informed.  Not all reading materials are dangerous to the mind and eyes of the youth. The issue is how the parents raised them to embrace knowledge that they see. A maturity level must be high enough for that child to be able to understand what it is they're looking at. It would be useless for the adult to hide things from them until the age of 18, when they are legally obligated to consume any sort of knowledge. The easiest way would be for the adult and child to have a sit-and-chat session for better understanding.  Removing novels and books from libraries publicly or even at school would do nothing more than just raise the child's curiosity level to the highest extent. This, some would believe, would persuade the child to go out and experience it first hand so that they know what it is, and later in life know what to expect. Doing so would, could, and may be harmful and dangerous depending on the act made by the child, when the simplest solution would just be approving that child to read and be educated.  Therefore if one person out of millions dislikes a book because they feel it can greatly influence one child to do the wrong thing, then another child who try and keep themselves away from it can't be taught because someone had a deep abhor for it and decided that it was outlandishly inappropriate for someone, much as a child, to read. To agree to removing information form the library is absolutely purposeless, and may be an inconvenience for someone whom may have been determined to research something. With all honesty, books and novels were made for a reason. That reason is to entertain, inform, and educate; by removing every source all those who agree to the cause should also agree to the fact that they have no remorse for the outcome of how their child grows up and become someone they never wanted them to be, and they should consider the wider implications of limiting access to information for everyone.
1023	4000	2	3	Libraries have so many books, and books that talk about everything so what would be the point of having a book taken off the shelves. If people want to read something that is to bad I say let thim what is so rong with reading everyone needs to read maybe thats the only books some people like to read. So by taking thim books off isn't helpping anything. I think some of the bad books taken off the shelves are good just have bad things in thim, any book is a good book. If something is so bad it needs off the shelves there has to be a reason for it, the way I see it is that there as to be a really good part in that book that just loves to make people mad and you know what that is funny. People get mad at books that they dont want there kids to read, or there mad because that didnt come up with that idea. If you dont want ur kids to read it tell thim not to let the older people that dont care have a good time reading. Most people like to read about mested up things. Music and Movies are a different story. Bad movies shouldent be put out for everyone to see movies arnt the same as books because a kid could get a bad book and not now have of the bad stuff means. But movies show you how bad things are shown. Music can also teach you how to do bad things by doing the same thing they did to make thim look cool. But I still think you should be able to have what you want to pick and if you have kids you are a boss to thim you can tell thim not to get anything bad. When books are challenged and removed, it limits access to different perspectives, and reading a book with controversial elements doesn't necessarily make it harmful, as individuals can form their own opinions; ultimately, parents should guide their children's choices, allowing others to explore diverse narratives freely.
1024	4001	2	3	Libraries should offer a diverse selection of books, allowing readers to choose what they want to read, whether it includes censorship or not. Removing books based on content limits reader choice, and the back of each book provides a description to help readers decide if they want to read it. While suggested content may not be suitable for young children, high school students are generally capable of making their own choices. Similarly, music should not be censored; if a song contains offensive content, listeners can simply change the station. Choosing to listen to a particular radio station is a personal choice. Movies also provide descriptions and ratings on their cases, allowing viewers to make informed decisions about what they watch. If a movie contains undesirable content, viewers should choose a different one. Magazines aim to present the truth, even if it's difficult, and their content is typically indicated on the cover. Readers can also browse through magazines to assess their suitability. Libraries should not remove books based on content because patrons should be aware of the range of materials available. By choosing a specific category, readers acknowledge the type of book they will find. Ultimately, censorship limits individual choice and access to information, and people should be trusted to make their own decisions about what they consume.
1025	4002	2	3	Libraries should or should not have books, music, magazines that are found offensive? Some people like things that are different than what you or anyone else like you think some of the things are offensive, but yet again something you don't like someone else like, and want to read. Would if be fare to you that you like something, and want to read it, but someone else dose not like, and thinks that it offens them, and they should take it off a shelf at a public library because of what that person said. I don't think that thinks like that should be taken off a shelf for something like, becasue there could be a person in school that needs soemthing like that is not right for a child to be looking at,but what if there is a kid in high school or collage that needs a book to do a project over that type of things, but also yes I do think that things that little kids should not be looking at or listening or reading something like should not be able to get a hold of because parents should not have to worry about them going to a librariy, and there children see something that they do not want them to see. There are vary many ways that people that work in the libraries can keep things up from children that is to little to see or hear what there parents do not want them too. Some ways that you can do that is by putting all the books and music that is like that in a section of the library that you have to be a sertent age to be able to go look or listen to them.  Lubraries are for everyone no matter what you look like or dress. You as a person has the right to go in to a public library and look for something to read no matter if it has some curse words or some violence in the reading. If you are reading those kinds or books you should be machure for your age and not have to worry about it. You hear and see everything that you read about today so I don't see the difference in if a child hears or sees it beacuse you see it just about every where you go now days. You really can not get away with out dealing with it. Libraries should strive to offer diverse materials while also considering age appropriateness, perhaps through designated sections or parental guidance resources, so that access to information remains open to all while safeguarding younger patrons.
1026	4003	2	3	First, libraries are a good source of information. At the same time a library can have pros and cons to its information. Some information should be only seen by adults. Have you ever wondered what if a child got their hands on an adult book? What's one way we can stop this? Implementing age restrictions on certain sections could be a solution. Next, you can find information about everyday life. Through magazine, movies, music and books are ways you can find them out. You have explicit music where the artist curses, and says inapropriate things. There has been books from my past experiences where an author just talked about her sex life. I have a past experience with magazines too, such as '@CAPS1' *Cosmopolitan*. All these have to stay out of libraries or put in a section where children can't reach them. Third, parents should monitor their children when they go to public places anyways. The library should be divided into different parts. Music isn't really necessary at a library. They could throw the music out. Also, at the same time children shouldn't get their hands on the books but they would have to learn about that stuff in life eventaully. The committee should have a contest in which people of any age of the community could write an essay telling their opinion also. Finally, I've came up with a plan to fix this situation. I personally don't think they should throw these books out because this is how people make a living and some people actually like these things. So they should set up an adult section in the library where you have to be @NUM1 *18* or older to enter and a identification card to prove it. Also, you must have a membership to that department. That way we don't have to worry about censoring these books, etc. Children will not be able to proceed in this section. In conclusion, libraries are a good source of information. So they shouldn't throw these books, music, magazines and movies out. The library could just set up a different section for certain things and people of certain age, ensuring that all members of the community have access to appropriate resources. In that way they won't need censorship.
1027	4004	2	3	I feel that you have the right to choose to remove certain books, movies, music, and magazines, but only if they are not appropriate for some people and children. Some people like them; others do not; it all depends on who you are. If I go to a library and the books I want are on the restricted list, the library should have a small fee somewhere around $1 to $2 depending on the type of book. For instance, if I wanted the movie THE MATRIX 3 and it was restricted, I would pay something like a Redbox rental fee. That is what I think about restricting certain items from the library, as it allows access while acknowledging potential sensitivities through a small fee.
1028	4005	2	3	People that walk the surface of our planet sometimes feel the need to have something banned or at least get some dirt on it to make people think less of it. It is just the way our world works when it comes to something you just can't stand, but why even bother, just what exactly are they going to get out of it? If someone took the time to make it then we all deserve the right to view it. I do not agree on censorship in our world. Local libraries are a very nice place to go for books, movies, and information. How is this to be such a good resource for people once everything is gone, especially considering some of the world's greatest books ever written are the ones that are targeted by censorship. I believe Katherine Paterson has a very valuable point in saying, 'Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' because it is true. People don't stop at just one, once something is gone they will continue hunting for things that they just hate, which will lead to people suffering from not being able to enjoy the things they want. When I was younger, I remember going to the library all the time for certain movies and books. I personally got to actually see a book be removed because of censorship, although I did not fully understand, I felt that if I read it, I would get grounded. Which is also not good for kids because they shouldn't be scared to read something. We live in a place with the freedom of speech, but yet that right seems to be fading away. There's still more ways to see censorship and how it affects the libraries though, such as actually reading about some of the cases that have tried to ban books. Although most fail to be banned right now, the world is very unpredictable. In school there have been many times where kids got the chance to read case after case about people trying to get some of the best books banned. Which is funny how those books are the only books that were fun to read during the school year. So that doesn't make sense on why to take them off the shelves. Reading is what keeps us informed, on the past and even the future. 'Then we have no books left,' if this is what people wish for then keep at it, but if there is some sort of decency in you, I would imagine when it comes to making an easy choice like this, you too would choose the right one. Saying no to censorship is the best way to ensure that future generations have access to the knowledge and stories that shape our world. Reading is what keeps us strong, entertained, and those who know the past are not likely to repeat it, unless books are gone.
1029	4006	2	3	Many individuals visit different libraries all over the world every day. Some go for books, some for magazines, and some for movies. Everyone has different tastes, so a library is where they go, because they have absolutely everything. Libraries have all kinds of amazing different books. It is where people of all ages go to find books or other materials that they would like to read or use for research. There should be no limits on what books, movies, magazines, etc., are on the shelf. Everyone has different beliefs/feelings on what they would like to read or see, and they should have the freedom to explore those interests. If libraries start limiting their options, I don't think that they would have as much business, and people would not read as much. Which means that an individual's **knowledge** could go down. Reading helps everyone in this world by learning new vocabulary and just exercising their own eyes. By taking away someone's interest, they won't read as much or feel as free, ultimately hindering their personal growth. Just because someone doesn't like something, does not mean the next person won't. If a book or movie, etc., is offensive to someone, they can just simply not read it or watch it. No one has the right to take over someone's mind regarding what they are interested in. However, limiting the age groups for certain items would not be a horrible idea. Books that **might** be offensive or not appropriate for a young child should not be allowed to be seen or checked out by a young child, but that does not mean take it away from others. Therefore, libraries should strive to maintain a diverse collection while also considering age appropriateness for certain materials, ensuring that everyone has access to a wide range of resources without infringing on individual freedoms.
1030	4007	2	3	Books nowadays have action, romances, and so on. That's why books that aren't moving off the shelf often lack what other popular books have, causing them to sit there. Many books that are getting bought are the happy @CAPS1, The @CAPS2 side, The @CAPS3, and all of the vampire books. It's because they have action, love, and so on. The books that are on and off the shelf are maybe really good books. Some books don't ever leave the shelf; it's probably because they are not really that great. The reason for it is because the books that are still on the shelf are boring or old-school, and they really don't have what the reader is looking for. However, the books that are really getting readers happy are the books that are from the movies like the @CAPS2 side. That book has sold faster than the movies. The reason why readers like the books more than the movies is because the books from the movies like the @CAPS2 side give more information on the movie. I heard that the book is nothing like the movie; the book is so much better than the movie because the book gives more information on the movie. So, therefore, people really like books that are based on a movie. There are more reasons why people like books nowadays. You don't have to go to a bookstore anymore; the books are now on your iPhone, iPod, iTouch, iPad, and a Nook, etc. So now you don't have to go to a bookstore anymore. You can get it on your iPhone and other stuff; people are really happy that they don't have to get up in the morning or whenever they get their books. They can, however, now just get them on the go. So that is why books are now accessible on the go. But I believe that people who like the feel of a physical book should also try getting an iPhone or Nook, something that saves you time while you are on your way to work or school, as that way, they can enjoy books in more than one way.
1031	4008	2	3	First, I do not think the libraries should take all of those things because some of those things people need to help them with their work. For example, some people need music to think, and maybe some people need magazines for research or inspiration. So I do not think the libraries should take the items off the shelves, as these resources support various learning and working styles, and removing them would limit access to helpful materials.
1032	4009	2	3	The short film I made The short film is about my friends watching the movie anthology horror of Dr. Terror's House of Horrors with @PERSON1. I admit i was scared out of my mind then i got over it. Then after a few times you get use to it I did. That's it for film assighnment.
1033	4010	2	3	The library is an important place for the knowledge seeker. The library holds books of past and current writers. It also holds information on past and current events. Censorship in libraries has become an ongoing debate. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed to avoid offensive history, books, or newspaper articles. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed to avoid offensive history. One reason to ban censorship in historical events is because it would create a loss of information. Periods like the holocaust, the genocide of about six million Jews by Germany, would eventually die with the generations that knew about it. The holocaust was an event that became known world wide during World War 2 which was a major historical event. The slave trade would be another historical event lost to censorship. The slave trade is a major part in American history that helped shape the country it is today. Another reason to ban censorship in historical events would be because of their importance. If we censor certain materials we began to forget key parts of history. Keeping those historical facts poses an opportunity to teach and learn. Censorship in libraries aimed toward historical events should not be allowed. Also, censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to change books. One reason is beacuse authors wrote their books how they intended them to be read. An example is Mark Twain. The author of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Both books use the word nigger to convey the tone. Another examample is the author of To Kill A Mockingbird, Harper Lee. Another reason to ban censorship in books is because that's an authors writing style. The author writes a book how they want it to be read. Therefore they use the language and words of the time period they write about. Mark Twain didn't use nigger because he was racist, he used it to convey what times were like and how people talked. Censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to change books. Finally, censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to get rid of newspaper articles. One reason is because newspapers was the way to send out information. It brought peoples attention to recent happenings. It informed people of what was going on. Getting rid of that is just another loss of information. Newpapers were key players in getting out information about Vietnam, World War 2, the assasination of JFK and 9/11. Another reason to keep from censoring newpapers in libraries is because of their importance today. They continue to keep people informed of recent and also past events. An example is the death of Osama Bin Laden and how he caused the deaths of many Americans on September 11th. Articles about views on the death penalty. Censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries to get rid of offensive newspaper articles. The library is a homestead to the knowledge seeker. There, they can read about past and current events. They can also read classics by great authors. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries to avoid offensive history, books, or newspaper articles, as these sources offer valuable insights and perspectives that contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the world.
1034	4011	2	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, the world knows there are people who censor what their people read and write, these works are often produced by communist and socialist governments. Here in @LOCATION1, the United States, we have the right to say, read, and write what we want, about anybody or anything. Censorship does exist in the @LOCATION1, United States, and it is in the form of opinion that it exists.  I have read articles in the paper about how textbooks have covered up the truth, due to what is politically correct. I have heard of libraries taking down books that have a very strong political opinion, often these are books written by conservatives. I have read about books coming out with the only intention of slamming probable presidential nominees. Being a conservative myself, I do not believe that these books should not be in bookstores, libraries, or other public venues.  I believe this because in @LOCATION1, the United States, we have freedom of the press and, for these books not to reach the public is against that right and, the free-flow of ideas. You @MONTH1, readers, ask why I believe this? I believe this because I too want others to hear and read about my ideas, on how to obtain life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Now that @PERSON1, readers, is why all books should be in our libraries. I agree with a restricted section where certain books should be stored, so little children will not get a hold of @NUM1, inappropriate content. I would like this paper to put an article out about these thoughts. We the @ORGANIZATION1, American people, are a republic, and we for over @NUM2, two hundred, years have encouraged the free-flow of ideas, a principle we must continue to uphold. Why stop now? Thank you @PERSON2, for listening to my perspective on this important matter.
1035	4012	2	3	My views on censorship in libraries are alike in many different ways. Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive to more than just one person. If they are not that big of a problem they shouldn't be removed. People might change their mind about going to that particular library, if they find a lot of offensive things there. Also having these offensive things in libraries greatens the chance they could be read by the wrong minds, and it could possibly change how most children act, or think. A few things that I would find, that would bother me are books or magazines that contain drugs, nudity, horrible violence, and bullying. From my own experience, having books that contain these types of problems are very offensive to most parents and can effect the way you live, if you take them seriously. Some libraries don't even realize that they have these offensive books, magazines, or videos. I have had a teacher take a book away from me and I got in trouble for reading it, even though it was in the library where anyone could have grabbed it off the shelf and read it. In my opinion I think libraries should take the time and look through the books they have and decide whether or not they are considered offensive to parents if their children were to read them. I agree with removing certain materials that contain offensive things, from all libraries. Also I believe if parents could choose they would decide to get rid of all the mean, nasty, and offensive materials. This would help ensure a more positive and safer reading environment for everyone in the community.
1036	4013	2	3	I believe that there should be censorship in public libraries. Libraries have families and young children going to them that do not need to see, hear, and read certain things. If people would like to buy inappropriate reading material, movies, or music they can do that elsewhere. Certain things are acceptable in public libraries and other things are not. Certain material such as rated PG movies and romance novels are not inappropriate or unacceptable. They are meant for adults but they are not showing extremely racy pictures on their covers. Other material, however, most people are not interested in having to see and our young children should not be subjected to that. People that wish to view, listen to, or read inappropriate material that is not meant for all ages or covers shouldn't even be viewed by young children can and will purchase or find them elsewhere. People that wish to possess these items will find another place to get them besides a public place with families and children. I believe these people reserve the right to view and listen to what they would like but they should be censored in a public library. Most people don't read inappropriate material in public and most extremely racy movies aren't even shown in theatres so why should you be able to check them out in a public place? Besides that many people do not even want other people to know that they are viewing these objects in the first place so many wouldn't even check them out at a public library. I also believe that not only should children not be subjected to these things but parents should not be subjected to their children wanting to know what certain things are that they are far too young to know about. The youth of Nashville is getting into new things younger and younger daily whether that be drugs or inappropriate magazines so I believe that we should not begin subjecting our children to that at an even younger age than they will already find out about it. It is important to protect children from premature exposure to adult content, and censoring inappropriate material in public libraries is a necessary step in ensuring a safe and appropriate environment for families and young children, as well as respecting community standards.
1037	4014	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 the author, Katherine Paterson. Her quote means that there might be a book, magazine, etc., on a shelf that someone shouldn't see. I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are ways people can avoid seeing them, and instead of removal, a better solution is managing access. I think that if something is found offensive then they should be in a special aisle.  First off, if there are items that people find offensive then they should be placed in a specific aisle. There are things that only adults should see so therefore there should be an aisle dedicated to the offensive or inapropriate things. And for someone to get into that aisle they should have permission to get into the aisle and show and I.D. so that kids and children don't accidently slip in and see things they shouldn't. Because if a child sees something bad, then that might influence them to do bad things because they won't know any better.  Secondly, if an indivual finds a book or magazine offensive, then they can avoid it by simply walking away. That person doesn't have to read it or look for it in a library if it's in a certain aisle. But if someone is really offended by something then all they have to do is go complain to the person head of the library and it can simply be removed if there are enough compaints. Then again, it's not that hard to avoid something you don't like. It might bother you that it's there, but it should be out of the way for younger kids to see.  Thirdly, the library will contain things that are found either offensive or inapropriate so children entering the library should have adult supervision so that they don't see the bad things. If a child sees something bad, they might find it interesting so they might want to pick it up and read it, which is bad because it might give them ideas.  Finally, there are many ways to avoid seeing something you find offensive. You can walk away if you notice something you find offensive or you stay away from that area of the library. There are going to be many things out there that people find offensive and inapropriate, but there's not much you can do about it. The best thing to do is ignore it and walk away. And if you're that concerned about it then you can always make a complaint about what has offended you or what you think is inapropriate for children. Putting bad things in an aisle is a smart idea because little kids won't be able to access it, ensuring they are shielded from potentially harmful content while preserving access for adults.
1038	4015	2	3	Books on shelfs are there for a reason. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson wrote. The quote in short words for me means what should and should not be allowed for children and what they should learn as children. Libraries have non- fiction and fiction books as well as magazines, music and movies. I myself like to learn a little bit of everything but of course there is things that I dont like learning when I am too young. I like discovering things on my own. There is times where I do like discovering new things because I dont know when life ends. In other words I'm surrounded by reality and have to come out of the fantasy world. Magazines also just have a lot of trouble and sometimes, yes it's life but also its just dramatic things about people.  A library is a good place to learn lots of things. You can learn about the history of presidents, countries, important people music,etc. Honestly, the only thing I go there for, is to read and to check out books, but from books I have learned a lot. There is some material that shouldnt be read and discovered when your too young.  Theres material that is too strong for some children and they should learn it as they grown not in a bunch. Libraries should have different stickers or labels on books for children and have a warning signs for their age. There is times where it is good to learn about life but you have to becareful because it might be to strong. There is books that teach you a lot. I have learned a lot from old books to new books. I don't think that the books should be removed, yes they might be strong, but is our owns choice to read it or not. There can be racist books, but they are there for a reason and it's not to make fun of people.  Magazines also are sometimes good because they teach good things and keep you updated about whats going on around the world. There is also some magazines that just talk drama and criticize famous people. I dont think its important and to be showing other people's personal lives or criticizing it. That is deffinetly not good for children to learn at that age. Magazines shouldn't be removed because everyone else has a decision at what to read and what to look at.  Music, at the library there is mostly music from like a centuries ago, but they were also great composers. No the music shouldn't be removed because everyone has a different taste in music. There's also new music, everyone has different taste and should choose what they want to listen to or who to listen to.  Movies, are a big part of life, so I think. Theres a lot from them that I learn from. From slavery to the future, there are movies where I have learned a lot. There is also some videos that are rated R, PG13, PG, etc. It is our choice to watch the movie without no one telling us if we should or not.  There is different reasons why there are certain books, music, magazines, movies that offend people, but it also has a significance. Books are not racist so other people can be made fun of but to learn what they went through. I'm glad that I as I grow I know what to learn and when I'm to young to read something. I think it should be allowed because it's for everyone. I dont think nothing should be removed from shelves even if the material is offensive, ultimately respecting the individual's right to choose what they consume.
1039	4016	2	3	As a fellow person of the community and a person who often visits the library, I think that books, magazines, movies, etc., should not be taken off the shelf. The reason for this thought is because, although it might be offensive to one person does not mean it's offensive to another. Taking various books and items away from our libraries takes away from many peoples' knowledge of our world. This in turn makes the world illiterate. Libraries provide multiple things that are not family discretion but, to the right age group offers a lot of knowledge. Movies are a large portion of this problem but, they are there due to entertainment reasons. I feel that all items that are equipped in a library should be looked at as a way of knowledge and not as whether it is offensive to a certain quantity of people. The removal of these things will become harmful to a new generation in the long run. I personally think as a person who attends the library often, that things being taken away cause uproar in different ways. I have read multiple books that have been acquired from all different sections of the library. Some even pertaining to racism of my own ethnicity that uses words that are not to my liking. I tolerate with the words due to the fact that I would like to know what my ancestry had to do in order for me to get where I am today. Magazines are also a small portion of this conflict. As like movies though they are there to provide entertainment. Most people like to use the library for a time of relaxation. The library is not just there for people to take books and other things it also there so that people can have a comfortable place to learn something. In conclusion, As a fellow person of the community and a frequent library attendee, I think that things should not be taking off of shelves. Libraries provides various things that are not at a family discretion level but, can provide help to other people. Some books pertain to racism of ethnicity. It's not meant to be harmful but to show what your ancestor had to endure to get your where you are. Things like magazines are there for your entertainment and if you think it's inappropriate then you shouldn't read or watch it, and we should trust individuals to make those decisions for themselves.
1040	4017	2	3	There are two things that i would have to say about removing books off of a library's shelf. First being that there will always be something offensive to someone no matter what it may or may not be. Second, no matter what you do or try to do there will always be something that a child will do or see that you may or may not want them to see or do. If people could remove things that they find offensive then there wouldn't be anything on shelves or in stores or really anywhere. There are too many different kinds of people who may dislike too many different things from anyone else. If a person were to remove a book, and another person wanted to get that book, but found that a person requested it to be removed that person wouldn't be happy and stop coming back to that library after one person had to ruin something they enjoy because they found it offensive. So what if a book found offensive was removed? there are much worse things on television. Cartoons are more violent then what most books are, more and more commercials and other types of advertising are using women, money, and fame to lure people. Most of the time they are not meant for children, a billboard on the way to school advertising an alcohol product, or some kind of adult enjoyment, they are part of life. No matter what you may try to do to keep your child 'safe', just will not work these days. No matter hard a person may try to change something they find offensive there will be something just as equal around the next corner, be it a billboard, a poster, a movie cover, or a band, someone will always find something offensive and teach their children to do the same but, just because someone may not like something does not mean their children or anyone else's children will not either, highlighting the subjectivity of offense and the futility of attempting to shield everyone from everything potentially objectionable.
1041	4018	2	3	Conflicting works of art such as books, music, and movies, have always been seen in libraries. Whether it's SEX, VIOLENCE or RELIGION, someone is going to be offended. But whether or not these offending works should be banned is a common topic among authors, musicians, and movie-goers alike. I personally believe that all of these works have a right to be seen, heard, or read, because the creator has put much effort into stating their opinion and have a right to freedom of the press. You could take any famous work and someone could be offended BY it because it displays something contrary to their beliefs. But this does not mean that that work should be banned! Banning a book would mean total rejection to the author's thoughts and opinions, and everyone has a right to those. The censorship of any work is unconstitutional because as citizens of the UNITED STATES we have total freedom of the press. You simply can't apply censorship because whether you keep it on the shelves or not, people are going to be offended. Also, as shown in RAY BRADBURY's FAHRENHEIT 451, the censorship of books could lead to a society unable to have a real knowledge of the past and the feelings and thoughts of the people of that age. To me, 'offensive' books, movies, and music are not bad, they are merely a stimulant for debate. They can allow you, rather than just the author, to express your feelings on what was presented in the works. But to completely remove the competition of the debate would be sabotage. DORIS LESSING STATES that 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else.' IN saying this she is expressing that if we all could go into a library and remove the books, magazines, movies, or music that we do not like, then there would be absolutely nothing left. Every work would be remove because at least one person is offended BY every work of the sort. Therefore, to allow books to be read, music listened to, and movies watched is to allow everyone the freedom of writing down their thoughts or stances. The censorship of any work, anywhere, is allowing for the 'shutting up' of ideas. These ideas are the ones that keep society going BY making us think and helping to formulate our opinions. BY allowing this we are creating future generations of great thinkers. In this case, BY keeping books, magazines, and music on the shelves, we can continue to 'learn from the past' and utilize the information and ideas that have been used throughout history, ensuring a more informed and intellectually vibrant society for all.
1042	4019	2	3	The shelf is an object that holds many types of different materials such as movies, books, magazines, and music. It's all media and entertainment. But not everyone likes the media because one or all of these materials @MONTH1 be offensive towards the foreign and children. Censorship in our libraries could get a little graphic and such. Yes we see all the it in movies and music, but we do not want it in our libraries. A library is a place for study and learning for educational purposes. There are not for entertainment and things of that nature. Sometimes they could be a little fun but for the most part, people would like to take there children and show them something to help there minds focus on school. By all @CAPS1 rated @CAPS2 movies, dirty music, adult books and magazines should be taken off the shelves.  One day as I was in the state library looking on the shelves for a book on @LOCATION1 and its people. As I was reading the book, it said some very mean and offensive things about the @CAPS3 people. I thought to myself that this book should be taken off the shelves forever and never seen again. It shocked me that someone would put that book in a public library and let the foreign and others read it. After some people read about the @CAPS3 people; They had second thoughts and started get angry and disliking them for theses things and offensive comments made!  Magazines and movies should be taken of the shelves in the categories in my opinion of the people in different countries and the way they live. That could be very sad for someone because they could of really went through everything in that movie or what ever that magazine says. Another reason censorship should be under control is the titles to these materials. If a child looks at an adult film and it happens to be for a child, wouldn't you think that's a little offensive? I know I would. There is no way I want my child watching some violent movie.  We have to think for our children and the people that come in from different countries when it comes to public libraries. If censorship is not observed carefully then we could make the foreigners very angry or make our children become very violent and reckless because of the films on the shelves, and the people that come in to our country would never come back if they picked up the book that they might of thought that was interesting but turns out to be very offensive in there opinion. Censorship is very important in libraries and on the shelves, and if we are careful, we can create a welcoming and safe environment for everyone.
1043	4020	2	3	I can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the book shelf. I hope our children or any other children take this book off the shelf because it would be offensive or demeaning to the race of me or the children. This book would probably make the children asks question that we don't really want to talk about. This book would probably be a book I wouldn't recommend for my children to read or even look at the pages or cover of the book. I mean if it wasn' t demeaning to anybody's race or skin color I would let my children read it, but if it had like profanity and racial slurs in it I would tell my kids that this book is off limits until you are older. Certain magazines such as like swimsuit models and other inappropriate stuff my children shouldn't be aloud to look at. Music is like the magazines if it has like profanity and talks about drugs then I'm not going to let my kids listen to it. Movies are just like magazines and music, if it has inappropriate stuff in it then my kids don't need to watch or listen to it. My exception for a movie is if it is rated G or PG, then they are aloud to watch it but if it is rated PG-13 or R then my kids can forget about watching it. So in the end, yes I can think of a book, movie, or magazine that I don't want my children or any children to get their hands on cause you never know what that could lead to. And if your a strict parent like I plan on being don't let your kids watch, look at, or listen to inappropriate stuff because that is just putting bad stuff in their brain. I have to admit I have watched, listened to, and looked at some bad stuff but I regret it all so very much so. There are so many inappropriate books, movies, magazines out there in today's libraries, it's bad because little kids can get a hold of this stuff and take it home without their parents noticing that they took this bad stuff home, and that is why parental guidance and careful monitoring are essential to protect children from harmful content.
1044	4021	2	3	If someone is offended by a book or a movie from a library, should they be able to get it removed? I want to explain my opinion towards censorship in libraries. If some parents see a book they are offended by, and they don't think their children should be able to get it from the library, they could just forbid them to read it. I don't think they should be able to remove it, even though they might think other children shouldn't be able to get it either, but that's not their decision. Every parent has to decide on their own, if they want their children to get certain books, but one parent shouldn't be able to decide for everyone else by removing a book. Libraries are meant to offer a wide range of perspectives and ideas, and restricting access based on one person's discomfort undermines this principle.  Some people might be offended by certain books in libraries, but just because one person is offended by a book, doesn't mean that everyone else is going to be offended by it. Does this one person have the right to say that a book should be removed? It is their personal opinion that they don't like it, but by removing it they would also keep other people from reading it, and that is not fair. Different people like different books, and are offended by different books, so if everyone would remove a book they don't like from the library, there wouldn't be any books left. I think if someone is offended by a book, they just shouldn't read it. They could tell their friends and family not to read it, because they thought it was offensive, but in the end everyone should decide for themselves. Respecting individual choice is crucial in a diverse society.  I don't think people should be able to remove books from the libraries, but if the library itself thinks a book is offensive, then they shouldn't have it. It is their library, so it's their decision what books they want to have there. I also think that when the library doesn't have certain books, because they really pay attention to the books they take in their library, that that should be good enough for other people. Libraries have a responsibility to curate their collections thoughtfully and consider community standards, but this should not equate to bowing to every individual complaint.  So all in all I don't think people should be able to remove certain books, because everyone has their own opinion towards what is offensive, and what isn't. We all should be able to read or see, what we want to, and not what others think we should; open access to diverse materials promotes intellectual freedom and allows individuals to form their own informed opinions.
1045	4022	2	3	Everywhere I go, there always seems to be something, small or big, that can be considered offensive. Because of these offensive things, there is often censorship in public places. It is acceptable to view non-noncensored materials at your own discretion and privacy, but not very acceptable to do so in public. I believe that censorship is necessary in libraries because of the wide range of audiences, the public materials, and the opinions of certain people. Libraries are considered public places and have a wide range of audiences. Whether it be children, teens, adults, or elders, some things are inappropriate and should not be accessible to certain people. This is directed mainly to children, however. Like the quote mentioned, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' Who put these offensive books in libraries then? Censorship will block out inappropriate parts of books, movies, music, and magazines in order to make these materials more suitable for all age groups. This protection ensures a safer and more inclusive environment for younger patrons. Because libraries are considered public places, their materials are considered public property. Everyone has the right to these materials. However, not every library will have the book, magazine, or movie you could be searching for due to the fact that it may contain profanity, or inappropriate content. Some people may be against censorship in libraries, but there often is not censorship in bookstores, movie stores, music libraries, etc. If you desire a certain non-censored material, then go purchase it. That way the material will no longer be public, but rather your own and you can do with it whatever you choose. Owning the material grants complete control over its access. We now live in a world where everyone voices their opinion freely and you can not be punished for doing so. Libraries are targeted toward every age group and censorship just allows everything to be appropriate for everyone. Certain parents do not allow their children to read certain books, view certain movies, or listen to certain music and this is just because it is their opinion and their parenting. Some parents, on the other hand, do allow their children to partake in inappropriate materials, and that is perfectly fine, because it is their parenting and their children. However, libraries should not have the right to introduce inappropriate things into the lives of children; that should be the decision of the parents or guardians. The library's role is to provide resources, not to dictate moral standards. In conclusion, censorship should be allowed in libraries because of the wide-range audience, public materials, and the strong opinions of the people. Everyone deserves to read, watch, and listen to whatever they choose, but not everyone deserves to be around inappropriate things in public places. Not everyone can be happy, but everyone can be appropriate. Therefore, some level of censorship helps balance individual freedoms with the need to protect vulnerable populations in a shared community space.
1046	4023	2	3	In my experience some music is just too offensive. They use words that should not be heard by certain people and especially certain ages. Even the magazines have things that are just way too inappropriate for some people. Some of the movies they put out these days are just horrifying to see. The fact that they put these things in a library shocks me greatly. One day I was babysitting a little girl and I had taken her to the library. There was a CD on a shelf and she put it in her CD player. It was making very sexual references and had many curse words in it. I was mortified that the little girl had to hear those words at such a young age. As soon as I put my ear to her head phones, I turned it off immediately. They should really watch what music they put out to the public because if I hadn't of been with her, she might have picked up on some of those words. I don't think society would want anyone listening to that kind of language at any age really. It discriminates woman and gives young children ideas in their heads of sexual activities. One other thing they put out in libraries I don't agree with is magazines that are a little too mature. I went to the library one day with a friend of mine and I picked up a fashion magazine. I was flipping around and I saw all these revealing pictures and I was thinking to myself, 'What if a young child picked up this magazine when no one was looking?' That would be a horrible experience for a young child to have. I've read somewhere that things children see at a young age, have a great effect on who they will become. If this is true I certainly think we should censor what we out out in our public libraries and be careful if we take our children to the library. We should make sure the next generation doesn't see certain things that we have. We should also monitor the movies the watch and keep a close eye on the things they read. It's crucial to protect children from premature exposure to inappropriate content to ensure their healthy development and well-being.
1047	4024	2	3	No, I don't think anything should be removed because not everyone wants to look at the same thing. I think if you don't like it, don't look at it, so there is no need to remove it, no matter what. This approach respects individual preferences and avoids imposing one person's or group's tastes on everyone else, allowing for a more diverse and tolerant environment.
1048	4025	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson's quote voices a strong point on citizenship. Censorship happens everywhere you are. Whether its a book, a magazine article, or even a tv show things are censored. Censoring things doesn't make anything more enjoyable, but infact makes less things enjoyable.  I think that things that are offensive should not be removed from the shelf. Censorship diasble the viewer and or reader to be able to enjoy the full potential of things. I myself watch tv shows all of the time. When the censor things it makes me angry. I already know what the words are so why censor it. Harper Lee wrote a famous book called To Kill a Mockingbird, and that books has been banned from being taught in schools simply because it says a racial term. I have two things to say about it. One if it offends you then you shouldn't watch or read it. Second one would have to consider the time and age that the book has taken place and that was language used back then. So then one could take in thoght when the book was written, what was the time of when the book had taken place, ect.  There are two books that I read called the Giver and Fahrenheit 451. Both books have one thing in common. The use of censorship in their society. In Fahrenheit 451 books are censored. Ray Bradbury causes one to challenge that concept because he and others felt that it wasn't fair for books to be banned. Also in the Giver a boy challenges his dystopian society because they too censored certain things. Censorship also happens in todays' media. Some example are T.V shows. TV censors vulgar language, and sometimes violence and gore. Now its understandable to censor childrens shows but shows for mature audiences are unacceptable. Considering the freedom of speech one can express. Also mature shows are only ment for mature people to watch them so why censor them?  Katherine Paterson makes a valid point in her quote. I feel that if you find something to be offensive then don't read or watch it. If you feel that something is so offensive to you that you have to compell otheras in to believings what you think then you are wrong. People should have the right to read, watch, or listen to anything they want uncensored, and we must be vigilant in protecting those rights in order to foster a society that values diverse perspectives and encourages critical thinking.
1049	4026	2	3	Does censorship solve any problems? If one person wants to censor something in a library, there is bound to be another person on the other side of that argument trying to protect that work from being taken away. As a free country, it is every individual’s right to take in whatever form of literature or music that they find pleasing, and history has shown the world that censorship leads those in power down a dark road. The shielding of offensive materials is only necessary and fair when the young, impressionable minds of the world's youth are at stake, but once a person is old enough to make informed decisions, it should be their prerogative to choose their own material. Censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history, but necessary when protecting the young. It is a person's right to choose what kind of literature they would like to read. If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned. For example, take a hypothetical public library: a public library is an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music. A great mental image of serenity and peace. How does this picture appear to a bystander once books begin to disappear off of the shelves? Suddenly right and left, books are disappearing as if by magic: a certain book is disapproved of by mothers, a religious group does not like the message this book sends, and this book makes people sad. Before long, there are not very many books left in this hypothetical library other than books for toddlers. With this system, everyone suffers because the range of available knowledge is diminished. Everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to. It would all just be simpler if books were just not banned from libraries. History has given the world many a cruel dictator. Oftentimes, once he comes to power, he is not the most popular of governmental forms. To keep his subjects underneath his rule, often he has to resort to taking away civil rights. This could be a curfew, fake elections, or censorship. If the ruler has the power of censorship, he or she can control what the public thinks, feels, and believes. With this power over them, the people are weakened and often abused. Now imagine that censorship occurring in a country that has civil rights. People would not stand for it. So why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom? There is absolutely no need for censorship to occur, and as history has shown, it certainly is not a good thing. Censorship is unacceptable in all forms in a free country that promotes civil rights. There is, however, one other element at play here: protection of youth and innocence. Almost everyone can remember a time as a child when they were young and innocent, free of worry and trouble. That can disappear in an instant. Children should not be exposed to things that are inappropriate for their age. Nearly every movie nowadays has violent and risque, if not full-blown-adult, materials present in it. The age of innocence is getting younger every generation, and children are becoming conditioned to this material to an extreme point. A claim like this may sound hypocritical coming from the mouth of one against censorship, but it is not 'censorship' when one is protecting the young, as it is a temporary measure. Due to personal rights and what history has shown the world, censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children. It is each person's choice of what they would like to read and absorb, so their choices should not be infringed upon. The world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people. Also, children should be protected, and that is not censorship. Censorship solves no problems, and it makes everyone unhappy, unless it is used to protect children. Therefore, why censor?
1050	4027	2	3	I think certain books, even offensive ones, shouldn't be removed. I don't think so because that's how some kids learn better and read better. Kids don't like reading boring books. Things like music, movies, and magazines are interesting to us. If this world didn't have movies, kids wouldn't read books. Most of these kids nowadays read books because they watch the movie to the story. Some kids like listening to music while reading. I'm glad people invented these things; I feel like if people didn't invent these things, this world would be boring. Magazines are also great because they help people start to read books and so on. Magazines are entertaining to people. I say they are because they have pictures, gossip, and much more. Magazines are good to read; they help a lot of people to read better and improve literacy skills. It's also bad because kids read them and start doing what they say in the magazine. Some books are good, some are bad. I say that because some books get out of control with cursing and the cover of the books, well, pictures. Some authors write good things, and some write bad things. Ultimately, it's a complex issue with both positive and negative aspects. Hope you get something out of what I wrote. This is how I feel about books, magazines, music, and movies. I love to read and listen to all of them; I enjoy books a lot and believe they all play a part in how we learn and grow.
1051	4028	2	3	When America was made and our fore fathers signed the constituition of the United States, freedom was the big kahuna. With every signature endorsment added to the constituion, America became one of the few countries with freedom in every right. Laws such as 'you are innocent until proven guilty' and freedom of speech have made our country stand out from other nations that suppress thier own people. Freedom is America's middle name and it is the birth right to our future! Freedom of speech has been shown everywhere and even though some people's voices say a little too much it is still a right given to us so we must accept the nonsense that is said. Offensive things are common, since we are all differnt and the variety of ethnic groups in America are so vast, that at one point in time someones toe are going to get seriously stepped on. This is not tolerated but still it goes on through the world. Freedom of speech is a unidentified form of express, since it is allowed to say what you feel but sometimes it is said to much and you end up in a fight. Speech is still a freedom though, and if we cut out freedom we would be in a bad spot. Genocide, and inlawful inprisonment are two factors that happen regulary on account of no freedom. If you speak out against a powerful figure, you go to jail. If you belief in something differnt armys come and kill you, all because some country do not have freedom like America. This freedom might cause controversy and produce offensive products such as reading material and videos but its alot better than living under the shadow of a dictator. Crude forms of freedom always end up on magazines, books, and cd's but if you think about it there being produced then they are being bought, or they would not be made at all. On certain occasions items are not being made for economical benefit but mearly on belief and religous values, that is also a freedom that many have paid with there life, to have. Also with the production of books, movies, and cd's you are protected from being exposed to points of view you do not like these things do have a rated supervision system, and if you do not like the product put it down and walk away, yes it is that easy. I do not see freedom being thrown out the window anytime soon, we might just have to keep living with offensive products. We should all just be glad we live in afree society that lets us express our diffrence without being killed in the process. You cant just go take the constitution and disgard like trash so society will just have to bear the burden of expressed freedom. Freedom comes in disc and books but it is still America's middle name and the birth right to our future, even with the discomfort it may sometimes bring.
1052	4029	2	3	"Do you think that books, movies, music, etc., should be moved if they are found offensive? I can't choose because they are both understandable. Therefore, I will discuss how I feel about it in this essay and what I have experienced on this topic. Well lets get started! I could go both ways with this. But first I will just discuss the way I disagree with removing offensive things. Material that is interesting to many people might not be interesting to me. I mean everyone should be able to listen and read things that they love and enjoy. And I could really care less what other people love to read and listen to. Someday, we all might come to enjoy things that we wouldn't ever think we would. It's just that simple. I mean I love romance and scary books, and someone else might dislike them both. No one can tell anyone what they should like or dislike. I agree in a way too! When people make a big deal out of somethings it kind of gets on your nerves, like when your mom is telling you make sure room is clean all the time! I agree with this because something maybe to offensive to someone and doesn't want their children exposed to it. One time I was in a library looking at this book that really seemed good to read. But then some lady told me that I shouldn't read it because it was too much for me. But it was just right for me. She went up to the main desk and started complaining. I was like, ""Are you serious?"" I didn't want to be rude so I told her calmly, ""Why are you so worried about what I am reading?"" She replied, ""Well, the book is too reviling."" I showed her what the book was called, ""[Title of Book]"". We ended the argument. I still checked out the book, because I knew I would love it, and I do! They should just put things aside, that they think will be offensive and let people ask for the things. So people won't make a big deal out of it. Just keep the peace and give everyone what they want. Well I'm done now. Hope you understand both sides of the argument. Just remember that if you agree or disagree, or you like me, who can't choose or understands both sides, it's your decision and no one can make you change what you love and enjoy to read or listen to. But I can't pick a side because either way their both a understandable, and finding a balance that respects individual preferences while acknowledging potential sensitivities is crucial."
1053	4030	2	3	"I believe that certain materials that seem offensive to certain people should stay on the shelves. I feel as though its on that person whether they choose to read or listen to the material or not. I have also been in this position where I came cross an article that upset me. Also I have had an arguement once with someone who found what I was listening to was offensive to them. Once when I was reading a paper on that was making fun of my town that I grew up in, describing it as filled with uneducated ""rednecks."" This upset me and made me feel ashamed. But I thought more and more that this article was someone elses opinion, and that just because they wrote it, doesn't make it true. This arguement went out of hand. She had her opinion and I also had mine. My friend came by my house one day to hang out and do some homework. While we were in my room I turned on my favorite artists cd. I listened to rock music at the time and loved how talented the artist was. My friend went to my sterio and turned it off. She told me she didnt like it and that it was offensive music. So after that we pretty much argued the whole time. I finally said that I feel its great music and I shouldnt have to stop listening to it. We had a deal that while she was there I wouldnt listen to it; I felt I would respect her feelings. Over the past years I have observed that more people are taking what others have to say or sing about to heart. When an author writes a story or an article, they are putting their opinion into it, sometimes including facts and also what they feel is right to say. If you dislike something on the shelf, the simple solution is to not pick it up and read it, avoiding the potential for offense."
1054	4031	2	3	I don't think so due to the fact that most libraries in towns and cities are open to the public. If a person or persons finds a piece of material offending, then they should pass the item or they can skim over it. On the other hand, the person or persons does have the right to freedom of speech but should not exceed their opinion above the level of the law. If music is played in the library that others do find offensive, then in my opinion yes, they should and can speak up for their rights. Books and magazines should be allowed in the public library even if they feel offended. This is due to the fact that it is a public library and there should be many different kinds of books. This is because people have different personalities, which mean we will like different things. That does not mean that others cannot speak their opinion because like I said earlier everyone in the United States of America has the right to speak what is on their mind even though it might not be what others want to hear, they can still do it. Well, that is my opinion on what I think should happen, and I believe this approach best balances individual rights with the purpose of a public library.
1055	4032	2	3	I think people read more books that are banned from schools and libraries, they listen to 'rebel' music, or they just watch controversial movies, so is censoring really effective? I do not think censoring is really necessary. If you think a subject might be offensive for you, you should not read it. Instead of censoring the products in a library we should trust the readers; I believe people are mature enough to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to. Media is just another way to gain knowledge that's why they are used at school. I would like to go to my school library and find books like, 'The CATCHER in the RYE'. I know this book is considered as one of AMERICA's most famous literature work, but it was once banned from some schools around the nation. The reason for the banning was that they believed that the book contained pornography, and it wasn't school appropriate. My English teacher used this method, by telling us this, to encourage us to read it. My classmates who hadn't read the book wanted to find the pornography in it, if you were to ask me... I did not find it. Another literary work which was banned once is 'The ADVENTURES of HUCKLEBERRY FINN'; this book was banned because JIM, a black character in the book, was called a NIGGER, and thought to be stupid sometimes during the book. Even though JIM is the most noble and innocent character in the book, some people found this offensive and not appropriate. Movies with strong language are rated for its public so I don't think this should be a problem. Music, on the other hand, depends on the singer's music style and that should be monitored by parents. I truly believe that we should not censor any material in libraries, but if it's necessary, they could establish an age limit to check-out any controversial material, providing a balanced approach. As I said before, media is just another way to gain knowledge, and ultimately, individuals should have the autonomy to decide what information they consume.
1056	4033	2	3	As @CAPS1, we are entitled to both freedom of speech and freedom of the press. However, these rights are somewhat suppressed in the censorship of media at libraries. I can understand why libraries feel that they need to ban certain works; there are many children that frequent libraries, and having explicit content could deter parents from allowing them to visit. Surely, though, the media in question could be placed in a seperate area, off-limits to anyone under a certain age. Even if someone gets their hands on one of these works, safeguards could be used at the front desk to keep them from borrowing the material. Their library card would show their age, and the worker would not allow them to check out the work if they were too young. Furthermore, I trust in people's common sense. If they believe that a book or movie will be too adult for them, they will avoid checking it out of the library. Parents, as well, will surely not allow their children to borrow risque material. Information is open to those that search for it, and the knowledge it brings prevents unwanted results. There are those that want this content banned because it does not conform to their morals, but this is really just setting restrictions on other's freedoms. They @MONTH1 think it is too explicit, but another @MONTH1 not. That other person might want to use the material, but because of restrictions set by the first person, the borrowing of the work becomes prohibited. It seems that if the first doesn't agree with the material, they could just let it be, and not bring others into the dispute. People know their limits and generally make sure they don't cross them. I think this conflict represents the @CAPS2 way of life in itself. When a disagreement arises, no matter what the topic, one group of people wants to basically control what everyone else can or cannot do. They organize protests, sign petitions, etc. True, people do protest laws, and with good reason. However, there really is no need to argue over petty issues that could easily be avoided if people were to just use common sense to reach a consensus. I think this censorship issue is a prime example of that. When it comes to these kinds of debates, we need to learn that we can't be too quick to place restrictions; that we should leave others to do what they think is best for themselves. The best course of action is to leave others alone concerning simple things such as this, and to avoid placing any restrictions on anyone's works, rights, and freedom. To paraphrase @ORGANIZATION1, I @MONTH1 not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death your right to say it, so we must always err on the side of allowing access and trusting individuals to make their own informed decisions.
1057	4034	2	3	I believe certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive and inappropriate. I believe this because there are things in these items that hurt people in many ways. But when people make and read these items, they don't know how effective it is to the people that are buying these items. I also experienced an offensive book and an inappropriate book. When I went to a public library, I picked up a book and thought it might be a good choice for my book report. As I flipped through the pages, I saw words and images that offended me; there were words calling people of color names and pictures of women of color being raped or abused. I did not get that book; I just put it back, upset that people treated my culture poorly. A white librarian came up to me and asked if I needed help finding anything, but I just looked at her and shook my head. As I walked through the library, I saw inappropriate books that kids were looking at, and I could not believe what I was seeing. I think they should keep these books somewhere else so that younger kids will not get to these adult books, including the music that always talks about sex, drugs, and gangs. I think these things are bad for younger kids to be looking at or listening to because it can affect their future and cause violence, abuse, and harassment, things that will get our younger children in trouble as they get older. I think all public libraries should keep offensive material in a section for adults only, and they should have to show some type of I.D. to prove they are 18 and older, which would help protect younger children from harmful content.
1058	4035	2	3	Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, Censorship in libraries should never be an issue. It is a very simple concept. Obviously, no one wants their children being exposed to inappropriate reading material or movies. If a child wishes to visit the public library, their parents shouldn't have to worry about what their children will be looking at there. A library should be a family-friendly place where children can get together for story time, or where college students can study. I remember going to the library all the time when I was younger. I would read a different story every week with a large group of kids in the community. It was something I enjoyed doing. Don't you want your community library to be a place where children can learn and enjoy themselves? Unfortunately, some libraries do have offensive reading material, movies, music, etc. It is the responsibility of the library employees to put these offensive materials in the adult reading section of the building. Parents should tell their children that the adult section is off-limits, and the library employees should keep children from every being in that restricted area. These items @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, and they @MONTH1 be too inappropriate for children. However, there are some readers who have the right to look at these materials if they want. That's why they shouldn't be taken off of the shelves completely, just removed from the rest of the books, music, movies, etc. I am not one to deny anyone their rights. Even though I don't personally see the need for offensive reading materials in a public library, that doesn't mean that someone else shouldn't get to view these items. All in all, we have to be fair. Would you want someone taking away your right to do something you like to do because they find it offensive? No, nobody wants that. However, we still have to be reasonable about it. If there are going to be adult reading materials in a community library, they have to be in an area where children aren't allowed. It's just common courtesy, and everyone has to cooperate. This is why censorship in libraries should never be an issue. I hope that you can see it my way, and help me in fixing this issue once and for all. Sincerely, @LOCATION1 These items may be offensive to some people, and they may be too inappropriate for children.
1059	4036	2	3	We all have that favorite book, mine is 'OF Mice and Men.' Censorship is a book I would recomend to anybody, but there are libraries that have some books that are so bad I would be scared if my mom even picked it up and looked at the cover. My name is John, and during Censorship essay I am going to show you what I am talking about. I love to read during the day. I like to go out and just pick a book right off the shelf and start then and there reading, but when I see a book or a magazine that holds sexual acts in them I become very anger. I have seen many of my friends get lost in these books and magazines right in front of a adult like there mothers. They can go to a public library where they're children (as young as the age of five) and read and look at these terriable things. I don't know why these books are even needed in a library. Now people can get on the internet.V's and but or rent them. I have a best friend who lost is father to these sexual acts and pictures. My friends mother had enough and had to kick him out. Now my friend is becoming the same person. He can go out and buy these magazines from friends that steals or rents them from our local library. He doesn't even reconizes that his father did the same thing. He still never wants to see is father, but what he is doing is the same thing that his father also did. I have had varies talks with Censorship friend, but he said it isn't hurting anybody, but what he doesn't see is that he is hurting me. Back in the late 1980's early 1990's parents saw some of the books that their children were reading. That tried to put a stop to it, but the plan never worked. Since then Censorship problem has grown to a point that we will never be able to control. The libraries do this all for money they make. More people go to a library now not to study or to read in peace, but to get a sex high. This is where about half of the libraries money is being made. The goverment tries to stay out of this, because the money they get through taxes is coming of these people. When will it stop? No one really knows, but we will try to stop it all we can. The reason for Censorship essay was to show why the process needs to be stop. If you go to your local library and really look at what they sell or rent out, you will then know what I am saying. I will try to stop it, but probably will not suceed, but I will not stop with helping my friends in the future. Just be glad that you know about it now, and hopefully it will spark a change.
1060	4037	2	3	Offensive much? That's what multiple people feel towards certain books. For instance, if @CAPS5 was the bible and you were an atheist, or a person who doesn't believe in god, then the bible @MONTH1 be offensive and hurtful to you. I feel as a student that there are so many people in the world that by the time everyone inserts their own feelings by taking away books then we would have nothing left to read. You see, everyone is different in their own way, so books, magazines and music wouldn't be around because everyone feels differently about different subjects. I feel that they are a resource that is very helpful, and multiple times knowledgeable on many grasping subjects. First, besides books, we have magazines. If we would get rid of all of the magazines in the world then there would be a cut down on all those horrible advertisements that men long for. Second there would be less gossip. Most magazines are about @PERCENT1 gossip about the recent break-ups, and make-ups, of today's modern celebrities. I feel that the magazines are a waste of time because they hurt peoples feelings, also it's offensive the way that some famous people act. I strongly believe we should take magazines off the shelves. Lastly there is music. Some of the greatest inspiration comes from music. Don't you remember the song, 'We @CAPS1't @CAPS2 the @CAPS3?' @CAPS4 if you don't then I'll tell you a little about @CAPS5. @CAPS5's about America, things that have happened in the past and were a big deal. In the chorus @CAPS5 says, '-we @CAPS1't @CAPS2 the @CAPS3,- but we tried to fight @CAPS5. @CAPS5's always been burning since the worlds been turning.' @CAPS5's a song that is about Americans saying that they @CAPS1't cause panic and such things, but that since the beginning of time @CAPS5 already was. The song inspired many of the famous singers you @CAPS4 know. Elvis @CAPS6 is one of the many that you should know. We should keep music out so people, like me, who have been inspired, can inspire others. Music helps the blind, heals those who are sick, and give hope to Americans. Without music there would be chaos. Last and furthermore is movies, where would we be without movies? We need movies, not just for our entertainment, but some of the best movies are historical events. Events that help us get a better grasp and keen look at what has happened in the past. For instance the movie @CAPS7, and @LOCATION1, even the movie The @CAPS8 @CAPS9, they all help us picture events that have happened and are very enjoyable but also very educational. We should keep movies, there is no doubt in my mind. In conclusion I hope I have created a clear message that you will take into consideration highly. We need books and music to inspire and electrify the world, and magazines we need not. We all need a little inspiration in our down spiraling lives, and we need education; therefore, we need to ensure we keep those resources available for everyone.
1061	4038	2	3	There are too many people in the world to just have one opinion about one topic and nothing else. If a person knows something is unjust, they obviously have to tell the world about it, or they feel like their opinion does not matter. Take, for example, women's clothing. If you show a man a piece of women's clothing on a computer screen, he will probably only have one or two opinions about that piece of clothing. If you show a woman that same piece of clothing, she will have more than two opinions about the piece of clothing. This is how society works today and it is not just because we were brought up that way; this is how we think and how we act. @ORGANIZATION1 Victoria's Secret depicts beautiful as half dressed and makeup put on like plaster. Many magazines and books, such as @CAPS1 Cosmopolitan and books about modeling, portray beautiful as stick thin and your clothes almost falling off your body. Many songs and movies tell you that being beautiful is on the outside. If you can find these magazines, books, and movies at your local bookstore, don't you think that they could possibly be two miles down the road at your local @CAPS2 public library?  Libraries aren't just for adults and teenagers. They are intended for people of all ages. Many people do not realize this, but at many libraries, there are sections specified for teenagers. Young adult books and magazines should not even be put in the teenager section, only for the reason that there are subjects in many of the young adult books that a lot of teenagers have not even begun to discuss yet. If these books and magazines are put in here for teenagers, do you not think a five year old child could wander up to the section, take out a magazine and wonder how the women in the advertisements grew up to be so beautiful? Like I said before, @ORGANIZATION1 Victoria's Secret depicts people to look beautiful, when it's all photo-shopped.  If a five year old child can get their hands on books and magazines that they shouldn't even know about, @CAPS3 why would a library keep them on their shelves. The thoughts that the five year old child has now is '@CAPS3 why am I not that beautiful?' @CAPS4 body image is the key to how people view society today. Modeling agencies, photographers, and even cheerleading coaches make girls feel like they are worthless because they are 'too fat', 'too ugly', or 'too short' to be part of what they have wanted to be in their entire lives. Many women that @CAPS8 model starve themselves every day just to maintain the 'healthy weight' which is @NUM1 90 pounds and you can see every rib in her body.  Many books, magazines, and television shows portray this as well. You can find them in libraries nation-wide. The magazine, @CAPS1 Cosmopolitan, has articles about how to become skinny. The television show, @LOCATION1 America's @CAPS6 Next @CAPS7 Top @CAPS8 Model, shows people that being tall and as skinny as a stick is the way to go. Many workout books tell you that being like @PERSON1 Jane Fonda is the 'best for your bod' way to be. You cannot tell a girl that she needs to be a specific height and a specific weight by a specific time. Woman don't work that way. No one does.  Many magazines, books, movies, and music tell you this, and it is not true. I believe that if libraries took these types of materials out of their facilities, then if would drop the rate of society's '@CAPS4 body image' rapidly. Many woman and girls wouldn't feel like they are ugly or fat. They would love who they were and they would not believe what another person says about them or what they look like. Being beautiful is not just on the outside. Anyone can have a beautiful heart and that will shine through more than anything else, fostering a society that values inner beauty and self-acceptance above all else.
1062	4039	2	3	Ever went to the library and seen a book that was too graphic for a certain section? When little kids came into the library, does it seem like they should stay away from that section? Well, censorship should be in libraries nowadays. Many children are seeing bad material at too young of an age. Due to seeing this, they can get bad ideas and possibly lead them the wrong way in life.  In libraries, they have many books that are too mature for young children. They should have a restricted section in the libraries that only people of age or with parental guidance can pick books, movies, music, games, and magazines from that section. For example, in video stores they have an adult section that only adults can enter, not children. Libraries should be that same way but not with the same material in video stores.  Personally, I have seen children learning bad behaviors from video games, movies, and some books. While these children are young, they do not know what is bad for them. So, when these kids see the movie stars they envy and video games they enjoy harming other people they will pick up on the violence and do it themselves.  Libraries do need to take these books, movies, games, music, and magazines off of the shelves. If they do not, then they should make a place children cannot get ahold of these materials that can affect judgment. So when taking a younger child to a library, go in with and walk with them. It will save our kids of the next generation from violence and all other wrongdoing habits in these books, games, magazines, and music.  As long as there is not censorship in libraries, our children will see these behaviors and recreate them with other friends thinking that it's okay to do. Yes, once again I say censorship should be in libraries of anything of certain age groups or if it is offensive. By implementing these restrictions and safeguards, we can better protect children from exposure to harmful content and guide them towards more positive influences, ensuring a more wholesome upbringing. Do not let young kids walk alone in libraries so they can come across the wrong material for their age.
1063	4040	2	3	Books have been around for hundreds and hundreds of years. They have significant value in culture, lives, and everything else. We all see kids laughing and enjoying books about pretty ponies and little puppies. What we don't see is how books and magazines are really effecting people of different race, religion, or age. We should take a stand and get rid of these bad books. Negative books, movies, and magazines should be taken off the shelf to prevent hurt feelings and ideas. We have learned to accept everybody no matter what color they are. I remember in 3rd grade when a girl named Sarah got very upset because she thought a book was making fun of her skin color. Everyone in the book was white and excluded an African American girl from playing with them because she wasn't pretty enough. She went to tell the teacher and the teacher threw the book away and said that we should all learn to treat everyone with respect no matter what they look like. We need to have more books like what the teacher was trying to teach us, books that promote diversity and inclusion. To boost everyone's spirits and make them feel better about themselves. The world has changed and books should too. Many things influence people of different ages, race, or religion. Books that talk bad about other religions or make you second guess your faith are considered negative and should be taken off the shelf. How would you like it if someone was putting down your religion? That is how many people feel when reading that kind of material. These books, magazines, and movies are not good for anybody and should not be anywhere near libraries. Have you been watching what your kids are reading about or what movies they are watching? Most of children's books and movies have pretty princesses and little mermaids but not all of them. Behind some movies or books there are violence and bad scenes. When fight scenes occur and zombies attack, children believe that everything is real and that it is ok to kill someone if they are a bad. Boys believe that it is ok to hurt people because that is what happens in the movies. Girls believe that everything about a princess is perfect and flawless and to be a princess they also have to be flawless. Do we really want children to think it is ok to fight and be upset because they are not perfect? Libraries need to get rid of these book and movies because it is badly influencing the children in the world. Not all books are bad and not all of them are good, so we need to divide and conquer. We need to take a closer look and really examine what needs to be taken off the shelves. The books, magazines, and movies that influence people to think differently about themselves need to go away for good. To get rid of these books that cause conflict within a person is like getting rid of a big burden. It can make a really big improvement in adults and children. Please take negative books and movies off the shelves to prevent any unnecessary problems, fostering a more positive and accepting environment for everyone.
1064	4041	2	3	Books @PLACES @SCHOOLS @LIBRARIES @CHILDREN your in a library its many book that children decide to read that @NOVEMBER not be suited for their @LIBRARIES. Many parents allow their kids to read those type of books so they're use to it now. But some book aren't for children @LIBRARIES. Now and days kids are more mature and knowledgeable and can read on higher levels. @CHILDREN kids go to the library they look for book that catch their attention. Some books that are out shouldn't be out and thats my opinion. Most authors write about things such as sex, drugs, and other bad thing. @CHILDREN a child looks at things like that they get ideas about what the book is talking about and try those things they read. Im not saying that all kids read books and decide to try all the things that they read, but most will. Some kids minmic off certain things they hear, see and even read. Kids are always going to look up to other people so what they see you do they will try to do it. I beleive that things like books that kids should'nt read should be put away. Books should be taken off the shelves and put in places where only adults could get them. Just like video games only a certain age group could play the game because of the things they do in the game. The things kids see they soon try out. They should also make it where you rate a book like you rate movies, video games and other things. All books aren't bad for children @LIBRARIES but some are. I notice that many parents don't care about what their kids read as long as they're reading. People should'nt think that way because its alot of crule people in this world. I even seen on the news where it was an author who wrote a book about how he killed a lady. So many teens read that book and found it interesting. And it even gave young boys ideas about killing people or girl friends. That book should be in the hands of someone with a mature mind that really knows right from wrong. Its parents out in this world that wouldn't allow their kids to read books that have bad things in them. Most parents find it offensive that book stores or other places sell these type of books to their children. The things authors talk about in their books and what they include no @ONE should read. Books that aren't good for certain age groups or that have inaproprate things in it should be removed from the shelves. But certain people interpret the words different and veiw it different. Its many books out in this world that most parents or grandparents hope their kids or grandkids never take off the shelf. But its going to keep going on until someone speaks up, advocating for responsible access and curated selections for younger readers to safeguard their developing minds.
1065	4042	2	3	The material we read in books is sometimes offensive, and books that are offensive should be supervised regarding who gets to view them. I believe that every parent has the right to oversee what their child reads. I also believe that censorship is a good thing sometimes. The material we find in books is not as much of a problem to our youth as other things. The reasoning for me saying this is that youth today are not really worried about picking up a book and reading as much as them picking up a magazine, cellular phone, iPod, or using a computer. I believe magazines are worse than any book. Books are read mostly for knowledge whereas magazines are mostly read for people to catch up on the latest trends and may contain images that are not appropriate. Magazines can lead to people listening to the next hottest band, singer, or rapper, whatever.  Music that you hear on the radio is filled with suggestive lyrics, and then people get pulled in. Music doesn't have ratings where movies do. Movies are a little easier to control because of their ratings, but children are always going to get their hands on them no matter what. This is where the internet comes into play. Most people have access to a computer, and children could be on the internet for hours looking up things that aren't meant for them to see, despite educational uses.  The internet also opens up the doors to video games. Children can play with their friends all around the world now without leaving their bedroom. They also play with complete strangers. Some of the other players could be a bad influence to them because they were influenced by music, magazines, etc., that send a bad message. No one is ever going to be able to control what our youth see completely. The only way to fully ensure this would be to close our libraries and shut down the internet, but even if we did this, there could always still be a way for them to be exposed.
1066	4043	2	3	One book or movie doesn't make a difference in the huge library full of books and movies. That's why the books, magazines, or movies shouldn't be removed from the bookshelf of the library. They shouldn't be removed because some parents of the children don't care what their kids listen to or read, only if they are doing what the parent says. Also, the parents might think too much of their kid and think that their kid knows what books you want them to get or don't get. Although, if you're one of those parents that not only care about what your children read or listen to, and you realize that every kid doesn't know what their parent wants, then you should talk to the school's principal and see if there is a way that you could come up with an area of the library that is just for the books that have the wrong type of language or sex appeal that you don't want your children to have, or ever read, or you could ask them about a permission slip for the students to ask their parent if they care about these types of books. Then there are some kids who like to read those types of books and would be very disappointed if their favorite books got taken off the shelf, and they didn't have anything else to read, but everybody else in the school got to have their favorite books in school. If someone were to tell me that the book is changing their lives into something that is unbearable, I would say to them that, it's not the book. The kids chose to read the book in the first place, so it would be their own doing if their life changed. Ultimately, removing books limits choice and imposes one set of values on everyone. Finally, that's the reason why books shouldn't be taken off the bookshelf because some people like them, and if you are some of the kids or parents who don't like them or don't want their kids reading them, then have the librarian make a note to say they aren't allowed to check them out, letting parents maintain control over their child's reading while preserving access for others.
1067	4044	2	3	Author Katherine Paterson once commented, ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor-- then you also have exctly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. Many people in society share Katherine's view, while some belive in strict library censorship. It is important not to infringe on the rights of other people, surpress freedom of speech, or limit their knowledge. Therefore, I support her sentiment. If materials are thought to be innnapropriate for children ,or others for that matter, then censorship needs to be set up in the home by the parents, not by a public institution. America was founded upon the need for freedom: freedom of speech, of religion, and press. If we start to change that or limit what press a library can or cannot have, we are destroying a nation's core values. Can we turn our back on what our forefathers knew we had the right to? Furthermore, if we start to take a few 'offensive' books off the shelf, where do we draw the line? Anybody can claim almost any book is 'offensive' in some way, shape, or form, that does not mean we should immeadiatly take it off the shelf of an important public institution. If you do not want to take my word for it, look back at histroy. What kind of civilization was Nazi Germany? Not one you would want to live in I suppose. Hardly anyone would, and one of the things they controlled most was personal freedom. They started it off with the seemingly small act of censoring books. First, it was just viewed as unsavory to have a book they deemed offensive, in this case it was the works of Marx, Einstein-Freud, or Mann authors. Later on they started to burn theese books, and punish people for having them in thier possesion. If we are to live in a country, where a man has the rights he should have, then we cannot censor library books. This seemingly harmless act could have much greater consequnces than foreseen. Many families have different values they want to pass on to their children, morals they hope to teach them. The problem is, is that each families' limits and values are unique; We cannot just assume anything about families in general. I personally know a family that is very protective over what their children read, watch or listen to. On the other hand, I am aquainted with a family who allows their children more freedom to choose what they read. What one set of parents want to limit their child from reading about in January vary from another set of parents. If they find material they do not want their children to read, then they should censor in the home. They could start with a disscusion about why the material is inapropriate, and give the child the responsibility to obey their parents. It helps the parents become more involved in their childrens' lives and it aids the children in personal growth with responsiblity and respect. In the end, it all boils down to freedom. Do we want to live in a counrty with freedom of press and the right to publicly access it. My answer is yes, and I belive it is the answer of my fellow Americans too. We cannot clearly draw the line between 'offensive' and 'okay' because we are all different. Therefore we cannot bring our opinions down on the public instituion, but the home. It is not right to limit a whole society on what they have public access to because of one opinion, as preserving the freedom of access to information for all is paramount to a truly free society.
1068	4045	2	3	Most people consider libraries an unharmful place. However it's often found that some libraries have offensive books as well as magazines on it's shelves. Kids that are interested in reading can't be looking for a book and pick up a racy novel with a nude lady on the cover. I do believe libraries need to have some sort of censorship on not only their shelves but computers and movies as well. Let me further explain to you the reasons why libraries should have such boundaries. A library is a place to get away and explore your mind in a fascinating way; by reading books! Now would you want to be looking for one of your favorite books and find an offensive image? Nudity, cursing, and drugs are all offensive images I have seen in a library. It's not appealing to see an article about some sort of alcohol when its sitting right next to a kid's magazine. What kind of message are we trying to send to them? That it's ok to get drunk or have sex and read the magic school bus? I think there needs to be some kind of organization set up to go around and help censor libraries, ensuring age-appropriate materials are readily accessible. Since the media controls the internet and most of the magazines, I think it would be a great idea to dispose of that in our libraries. Libraries are a reading playground for not only our children but friends and family as well. We don't want our kids getting the wrong message when they go check a book out and pick out an autobiography on a controversial figure. Censorship does need to occur in our libraries and I believe it should happen soon. I'm not saying go and wipe out all the books you have already purchased at sometime because that's already in the past. No matter where you are you cannot escape offensive gestures; but please let's keep it out of the library, creating a safe and welcoming environment for everyone.
1069	4046	2	3	Do you want your children to have bad images in their head? Does everybody deserve to read or watch anything they want? I believe strongly that these materials should be removed from libraries in most cases. Offensive materials have no business being in libraries. These materials are not good for children, offend people, and do not look good on the libraries that carry them. First, I believe there is absolutely no reason for any child to see explicit material. This material can create a very ambitious young child. If a child sees a magazine containing pornography, the child will think that this material is acceptable. The truth is, that child should not know about anything of this subject until he or she receives approval from his/her parents. I know from experience that most parents would not want one of their children to see any of this material for a very extensive time. I have had a few disturbing experiences myself. One time when I was a young lad, I checked out a horror movie from the local library not knowing what the movie was about. I made sure my parents were not home when I watched it. After about three minutes, I was terrified. The images from the film stayed in my head for a good month. Such exposure can be genuinely harmful. Children do not deserve the feeling of fear for that long of a time. Next, some material in the library contain certain things that offend random people. Large public libraries contain music with explicit lyrics. We, as a society, do not want our youth to hear the nasty words in some of the rap songs that are released. In addition to that, this music offends many adults as well. Adults agree that there is no reason for any rap to be released in a public place like a library. Music is a very great art, but when certain people abuse it, it no longer has a good image. I have observed that children listening to rap at a very young age are more likely to end up turning out to be an unsuccessful individual. Also, some specific magazines contain images that are offensive to the people of our society. This idea relates to my first idea, but I will speak some of it again. Images like blood can sometimes offend the people of our generation. We do not need any of this. If offensive material was banned from libraries, our society would have eliminated one more problem that is taking away from our good world. I have been offended of some different magazine pictures before. Someday when I have kids, I will never let them go to certain sections of the library with this material. Last, I want to address the fact that specific libraries can carry a bad reputation if they carry this material. In addition, employees will definitely go to a different library without the bad music and the violent movies. Most of the adults that want their children to be successful and have a good, creative mind will think twice about going to the library without censorship of certain items. I have read that libraries with bad material are much less likely to attract customers than libraries with censorship. I know that if I was the manager of a public library, I would make sure that any items that have the potential to offend people would be immediately removed. A library should definitely not want that bad gossip to go around town about how bad that specific library is. Censorship is as necessary to libraries as flavor is to food. Shelves that contain inappropriate books, magazines, and music will only make their number of customers drop. If you think that this is only going to help libraries, I dare you to go ahead and try it out. Everyone has their own opinions, but I am a firm believer in censorship at public and private libraries. Inappropriate books, magazines, and music will only destroy the good reputation that a library have. A library is a great place to be, but the libraries without censorship are an utter disappointment. After all, it is your life, and you get to choose the way you want your children to act. Disturbing materials are only going to bring a negative effect on these minors. I hope to see the amount of censorship rise in libraries, creating safer and more enriching environments for all. If it does, people will see a dramatic change in all of my ideas discussed.
1070	4047	2	3	As the Katherine Paterson's quote states everyone in fact has the right to take books, movies, magazines and other items off the shelves if deemed offensive or inappropriate. However this should be their decision and only their's; not other parents rallying together to get their desired results; the removal of certain books. In todays times so much is viewed as offensive or inappropriate that wasn't when the previous generations read them. When parents read these things today they feel these items are inappropriate versus when they were teenagers they felt it was appropriate. Of course in todays technological age kids can lay their hands on just about anything if they know how to.  So, if parents begin censoring items there is one incentive or reason for them to read or listen to it; and disobey parents. They also get receive an unconventional or unintended education, gaining exposure they might not have otherwise sought. So if parents censor the kids have been given a multitude of reasons to go against their parents wishes and read or listen to it anyway. So that is why parents shouldn't censor what their kids read, listen to, or see because eventually they will see it; and this forbidden knowledge might be better navigated with parental guidance rather than in secret. Do you want that?
1071	4048	2	3	The topic of library censoring has been increasing over the past few years. It has been discussed by many people, but a decision has never been reached. I say that there should be no library censoring. I would not have found my love for reading if libraries were censored like they are. I think that there should be no censoring of libraries. It would impair our basic rights, such as our right to freedom of expression and our right to freedom of the press. We would no longer live in a free country but a totalitarian state. Though if they would put an age restriction on certain things that might please the debaters. I think that many would agree to this if it was proposed. Thus, if we did this, children would only be able to read or listen to materials appropriate for their age. Though it is the parents who should censor what the children read and listen to, not the libraries. It's the parents who introduce the children to music, magazines, and books. If the parents started to censor these materials early on, this debate would not be going on as it is. The topic of library censoring has been discussed and debated at increasing rates over the past years. Some want to censor our libraries, though that is not the best choice. A librarian said that if we have the right to censor libraries, then there will be no more books for any of us. Therefore, we must protect the freedom of libraries to ensure continued access to diverse materials for all.
1072	4049	2	3	I do not believe that such things as books, music, movies, magazines,etc., should be removed from libraries. First, books can be used as monumental learning sources for kids, teenagers, and adults. Just because a book talks about the deaths and dying months before doesn't mean it would be a little inappropriate for some age groups but not for teenagers and adults. Also books give a message about how times use to be. Take a book that refers to slavery and what they use to call black people back then. Just because it has some words that are frowned upon does not mean that kids and people shouldn't know about it and where it came from so they won't go around affending people and they don't even know what the word means. Next, movies now some movies shouldn't be played for certain age groups and I understand that, but movies like Glory and To Kill a Mockingbird are teaching us our history and how far we've come from being segregated and the disrespect of each others race. Also movies gives a more visual way of what things were like so we can kind of get a interactive way on how things look like and how you can relate the book to the movie. Movies also make points, some state if we don't do anything about pollution this is whats going to happen. So movies are definetly a stay on my list. In addition, a big factor of culture and history is music. I could see how some music could be bad but also some artist talk about how it really is tough where they come from and how music is a get away for them. Plus, music isn't hurting anybody. We learn how music was in the 1900s and compare it to music now. We also learn how music evolves from one thing to another, kind of creating off of itself. Music has the power to say things and communicate with people and make statements that could only be made by music. For example, take somebody giving a speech about what they feel or what they think. Now take that speech put it in a song form and I guarantee that more people capture the message and take it into there grasp on how they could help the cause. Especially if it is by their favorite artist. Say your favorite artist is Kanye West, now wouldn't you rather listen to Kanye West make a statement about life or a political view rather than a song like that by the government. So music is most definetly staying on the list because it has the power to move people, make you feel different ways, and look at things you've never seen in away before. Last, magazines, some Magazines are just inappropriate. Now I'm pretty sure that you will not be seing those magazines on shelves of a library so nobody should be worried about that. Now some magazines like People and National Geographic are just there for fun and they are not hurting anybody because its just pictures and honestly no child would read the words of a interview with a famous person. So magazines are harmless to in a library and are only there to stay up on current events and to inform people on if a new discovery was made or whats going on in the world. In conclusion, I do not believe that things such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves anywhere, as they provide valuable resources for learning, understanding history, and engaging with culture in various forms.
1073	4050	2	3	Somethings on the shelfs in books stores and other places can be very offensive. I think having cuss words in music and sexualy things can be offensive to women. I do listen to some music but noting like that becasue I think it should not be in music and books. One day I Think the U.S.A will be ran by a woman. There is noting wrong with that. Woman have the same rights as men do. There is some people that think woman are just there slaves, that is dead wrong. Woman and men are the same no matter what people say. Katherine Paterson as the right idea though. It would be great if the law would state that if you think something is offensive you should be able to take it off the shelf and throw it away, but some people would say other because there is some people out there who just care about them selfs and acted what ever way they want to so they can act or make them selfs feel better than they are. There are some kids who like to look and go though magazines and see all that bad thing they think that those people are cool so they teaches them how to acted and do bad things, That it why i think we should be able to take it off the shelfs. There was this one day I was in Wal-mart just looking around and I saw a magazines with some movie star holding her three kids. The title of the magazine was superstar. It really hurt to see those three kids on the cover becasue one day they may not be like there parents and have all the money in the world. It may seem really stupid these days that some people would care this much, I really think deep down that its life and we all need to get over our selfs becasue we can not all be right and have all the same feelings for life. All my life I have thought about this subject cause it seems like now days its all about the money, what they wear and what type of car or truck they drive. It seems really stupid but when i see someone who drives a new car worth $50,000 it really makes me think about how someone as the money for this car and everything else, which is why I think we should be more considerate of what we put out there for others to see and consume.
1074	4051	2	3	Libraries. What things are found in libraries? Well libraries contain more then just books. They can have music, movies, magazines, books, and much more. All of the things are not for just one particular age. Libraries have things for people of all ages, even though some do not like many of the materials found in them. The library in my town has certin place for chilrden, teens, adults, and for adult-rated thing. Not all people agree with what should be aloud in a public area. Libraries try to make everyone that comes find something that might be intersting to them. Even though some of the things they chose might be different then what the public expects. When I go to the library I think I would mind is i saw some adult-rated thing. Even though I think everyone should have the freedom to read, watch, listen, and hear about what they want. I think making areas where children can't go is a good way of letting people get what they want to get and not exposing it to younger people. Haveing these areas would help parents and childern feel alot better about what they would hear or see at a library. What can be done about this problem? Even though it might cost more or be to dificult for an ower of a library to do, I think that building rooms for different age groups would be an good thing to do. If smaller children see thing such as violace, durgs, and sex, they might think that it is ok to do. Most parents try and keep there kids away for those parts of library but don't always sucide. So there for I think that building rooms for these area is the right thing to do. Even though we all think different things should or shoulden't be seen in public, we can't stop them from being there. We could try to contain them to where only people that would like to see them do. It would just cost a little more money then some are willing to spend, but if you think of when you were a child would you of liked to see some of those things? If u ever have kids whould you like for them to see it? I would hope not. So try and make the better choic when u find unupropret things for unger viewers. Therefore, creating designated spaces is a worthwhile investment to protect children and respect differing viewpoints within the community.

1076	4053	2	3	Coming from a teenager, @CAPS1 offensive books, magazines, and movies should be removed from a local library. A library is a place to go relax and read. Most books and movies are filled with sex, gang violence, and drugs, sometimes making it difficult to find more wholesome content. In my generation sex, drugs, and gang violence seem to be high at risk everywhere. Books are supposed to be about learning. Offensive books and movies set bad habits on younger children, possibly desensitizing them to these issues. These are the reasons offensive books movies and also magazine should be removed from our local libraries.  Sex, gang violence, and drugs seem to appear everywhere in my generation. Whenever you open your magazine you find different topics, but they all deal with either sex, drugs, or violence. Children should never be exposed to that type of offensive behavior. You should be able to open a magazine and learn something brand new.  Books are good for research paper and other school project, but sometimes you can't find what you are looking for because of other topics. Reason you can't find what your looking for is because every book or magazine you look threw is covered with the topic you don't want. As a teenager each book I look at its always about sex or gang violence.  If younger children, continued to read about bad topics, it will create a bad habit on that child. They say you are involved with what you read. Bad habits could lead to many things, such as killing, smoking, and pregnancies. That's why all parents should have guidance over there children.  Being who I am, there should never be any offensive books, movies, and magazine in a local library. Offensive books and movies can cause many problems. It drives children where they don't need to be, and you won't be able to learn if you have to many bad habit. There should only be book and movies where you are able to learn something in your local library, ensuring a safe and enriching environment for everyone.
1077	4054	2	3	The Forum, I read an intresting quote the other day by Katherine Paterson an author. The quote said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- the work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I believe that people should not have the right to take matieral such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. of the shelf of a library, or anywhere else those items are displayed. So I agree completely with Paterson because people have their own opions. Some stuff might be more offensive than others to different people. I have observed people, and were all different so why should our thoughts be to? The answer is yes they should be different. But it is pretty simple if you find a book, song, movie, or magazine that you find offensive or distasteful then put it back another person might find it intresting. I want to know the thoughts of my fellow citizens about what Paterson has said. I am asking for your help to do so. I would like you to put the quote in The Forum and hear what people have to say about it. Thank You for accepting my submission. Sincerely, John Doe.
1078	4055	2	3	Most of us have had times when we are really into a book or magazine that we are reading, and all of a sudden we come across vulgar language, pictures, or activities that are not suitable for us. Why did the author have to throw this in the book? Why didn't the back of the book tell me that there was offensive behavior in this book? Why is this magazine in the library with risky pictures? It might even make some people not interested in that specific author anymore, or quite possibly persuade someone to stop visiting that library. Certain materials in libraries should be removed. The first reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because it is not suitable for children or even young teenagers. Let's say your child is at the library and they pick up a random book to check it out. Turns out, the summary of the story on the back is actually about college kids partying and participating in illegal activities. Your child on the other hand, does not read the summary and just wants the book based on the moral of the story, interesting cover, and critic reviews. If your child reads that book with vulgar language and illegal activities, you are most likely going to be upset. The second reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the books and other materials with offensive material can be placed in book stores, instead of the public library. In that case, parents can feel more content with having their children read any material at the library. Adults and older teenagers can still have their material choice, they will just have to take a trip to the bookstore to find what they need. They might not get to check out items for free like at the library, but it will be safer for the children and young teenagers. Not to mention, the people who respect their morals too much to read offensive material. The third reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the library should be ordered to state on the back of the book, magazine, movies, etc., in any way they choose, if the book contains anything that might be taken as offensive to a reader. That way, if someone is questioning the summary of the book, a risky title, or cover illustration, they can flip to the back to see if it will be tolerable for them. This warning system could also help librarians better categorize materials and assist patrons in finding appropriate reading selections. Libraries should remove certain materials from the shelves. It will create a more civil trip to the library. No more worries about accidentely coming upon a sentence or chapter in a book that is against someone's morals. Or flipping through pages in a magzine and seeing a picture that offends you. Libraries will contain safe books for all ages, while bookstores can have the pleasure of having offensive material on their shelves, making it a win-win situation that respects both community standards and individual choice.
1079	4056	2	3	Should books that seem offensive to you be put off of the shelves? I know that most people agree that it would 'better' our kids if they didn't read or listen to certain things. But, what would happen if everything that we thought was wrong was taken off of the shelf? I do not think that we have any right to take a book off of shelves because of its contents. If I look at a certain book and think, 'this book is offending me and my beliefs,' then I should just not read the book. Just because it is offensive to me doesn't mean it will offend someone else. Every book that has ever been written has affected someone, either in a good way or a bad way. Does that mean they have the right to say, 'take them off the shelves?'  I remember when I was in second grade, there was this girl in my class whose mother came in to complain about my teacher playing gospel music while we worked. The parent was extremely angry at the teacher and, at that time, I didn't know why. Now I realize that it was because they didn't believe in what the lyrics in the song were saying. The teacher never played the music in class again and was too afraid to play any other type of music. This highlights how easily access to different perspectives can be stifled.  Since everyone's views are different, by the time every person took off the books that offended them, there would be no books left. As Katherine Paterson put it, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly that same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This quote succinctly captures the danger of censorship.  In conclusion, I strongly think that books, whether they offend someone or not, should be kept on the shelves. Taking the book off wouldn't accomplish anything to begin with; it would only limit access to ideas and perspectives, ultimately hindering intellectual growth and open discourse.
1080	4057	2	3	I think that we should have offensive materials on the shelfs in libraries. People have their own ideas and opinions about offensive material like offensive content shouldn't be around in libraries for children to read or we should have offensive material because offensive content might help someone one day. Some times when people think of offensive material they think of bad and not good for people to read or watch because offensive content's not treating people right. Then also some offensive material like videos or movie can be very fun and make the movie great to watch. Today im hear to tell that offensive material can help students in high school research for a project, offensive content can also show us how offensive materials were back in the old days, and offensive content can also teach us more about offensive material. Today in are generation we do alot of studing or projects for school, we do this so we know more about the subject. As a high school student i would research the topic about offensive material. Why would you ask i do this? Because of researching this offensive material you can learn more about offensive content. Like where did offensive content come from, why people are offensive, you could probably find out more than what you know and thats a good thing finding out what you dont know. So if we take away the offensive material we would never get to learn more about offensive content or know where offensive content came from. Its good to still have have books that are offensive material because you get educated not to be offensive. Going to a library is fun and exciteding because you get to read all these books. Well when you choose a book you can choose the most recent one or the one back from the old days. In are case we have offensive material on the shelfs in libraries. Lets just say here you went to the library today and you wanted to research a paper on offensive material from the old days. Well in the library they will have generations of books on offensive material. This provides us of offensive material back in the old days. So the library is a good thing to have that because we need to know about what happend back in the old days. Everyone one goes to a library to learn more about what they like to do or read a really good book. Well i know alot of people that would love to learn more about offensive material. Offensive material to people is like a good book you can read offensive content and learn more about. Some people think learning to much is a bad thing exspecially when offensive content is on offensive material. Learning to much is not even a discusion because people can learn whatever they want to. If the libraries take away the offensive material offensive content is just like talking a good book from you. People can think what they want to think about offensive material. Like i said before if libraries take away offensive material book, its like taking away a good book from a reader. People do need to learn about offensive material thats why we still have the books. If we didnt want to know about offensive material why did they publish all the books and videos about offensive content. This is why I believe libraries should continue to provide access to offensive material, as it serves educational purposes, offers historical context, and ultimately empowers individuals to learn and form their own opinions.
1081	4058	2	3	To who it may concern: Do you take away books because someone might find them offensive? Do you believe racism is a part of literature? Libraries are considering removing books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from their inventory for censorship. They believe individuals might take offense to certain types of beliefs from the different variety of entertainment that they have in their library. These types of entertainment should not be allowed to be removed from public or private libraries.  In many libraries, their inventory is being stripped for censorship, meaning books, magazines, movies, and music are being removed because some individuals might find them offensive. Individuals might disagree with certain beliefs concerning their lifestyle and what they believe.  Literature can be described as art that an individual portrays in his/her own way. It has been in the world since man first learned to write to the present day, meaning it has witnessed wars, politics, art, and slavery. All of these are a part of literature, so literature is history in its own way.  Some say offensive material should be taken out of libraries, perhaps even removed from everywhere. It should not be because it is a part of history. Do you take away an era of history just because you find it offensive? It tells us what was happening at that certain time, in that part of the world, and what the opinions were of people at that time. Many people believe racism is wrong, but we shouldn't deny that many people once thought it was right, believing white skin is superior over dark skin. We should respect their beliefs as they respect ours.  Literature is important to society and how it works. Without it, we wouldn't be where we are today. Literature should stay on the shelves of libraries where it belongs. Personal opinions are a part of books, and we should respect that. Do you want to be known for destroying an important part of history? The act of removing books due to potential offense is a disservice to understanding the complexities of our past and the evolution of thought, hindering progress and open dialogue.
1082	4059	2	3	Many people have different views and opinions on things. No opinion or view is right or wrong. Books, music, and movies of controversy shouldn't be removed from shelves because not everybody finds them offensive, people have the right to view them, and others can't make the desicion for everyone. Everybody is entitled to their own views and opinions, but they can't make others see things their way. If someone was at a library, and thought the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series were offensive, they might be the only ones to think that. They can't tell the library to remove them because they're uncomfortable with the books. Things go by majorty rule, and that person is not the majorty. They're the only one with the problem.  Everyone has the right to view or listen to what they want, as long as it's legal. If someone finds a type of music that they find offensive, they can't tell the store to remove it. One person can't change everything to fit their needs. They would be making plenty of people unhappy if that type of music was removed. To make everyone happy, the person could just not listen it. There's a huge selection of music a person could listen to, without being uncomfortable.  One person cannot make the desicions for everyone. The president doesn't even make the desicions by himself; he has the government helping him. If one person felt as if a magazine was inappropriate, they don't have the right to change it. They're not the one in charge so they can't be the one to change the magazine. It might be inapprpriate, but other people enjoy reading it.  I believe that everyone's entitled to their own opinions and views, but they shouldn't make everyone see it their way. Books, music, movies, and magazines are few of the things that people try to control because they're uncomfortable with the subject inside the material. Some of the stuff is inappropriate or offensive, but one person can't change it. Not everybody will find it offensive, people have the right to view, watch, or listen to what they want, and one person can't make desicions for everyone. It is important to respect the diverse tastes and preferences within society, and individual discomfort does not warrant censorship or removal of content.
1083	4060	2	3	Should someone's work categorized as 'inappropriate' or 'offensive' be taken off of a shelf and not be able to be sold or seen in stores? If you believe so, then do you think it is okay for the campaigners that run for political office be able to express their thoughts and opinions on different topics? This is exactly what is being done when someone writes an article or a book that they have published to be distributed into stores or libraries. When someone writes a book on something, they usually have a lot of interest in whatever topic they are discussing, which is similar to campaigners presenting themselves to the public and announcing what party they will be running for and what their beliefs and disbeliefs are. If it is okay for someone to take a book off of a shelf, or even a magazine because people think the book is 'inappropriate' then maybe we should reconsider what the campaigners say on live television. Even if you were to walk into a store and there be nude magazines on the shelf, or CD's with lyrics that contain cuss words do you feel those should be taken off of shelves as well? There is a time and a place for where things like this should not be displayed. For example, when you go to a little kids store and things like this are being sat out for the kids to see, they will not forget what they saw or heard if referring to music. Kids have a great memory on things that should not be remembered, like when they read a story and it includes someone robbing a bank, or a song that refers to drinking or doing some form of drug. When kids see or even hear things like this, they are more likely to try things that we would hope little kids would not try. When someone spends months or even years on writing a story, they hope that they can get it published and be rewarded for their long, hard work. By doing this they try and get it to be published, and put in stores so people can buy it. Whether or not if your talking about music, movies, or books, its all the same. Things should be put out on display and people should be able to see all the different types of music and stories that are available. If things were going to be taken off of shelves or not put out onto display, people will stop recording music, acting out movies, or even writing ads and books. When and if this were to happen, people will not become educated with new available data. If there is nobody to write science books, or biographies then nobody will learn about new things. Same with music and movies, if people spend a few months or even a year writing a new album, or coming up with an idea for a movie and they work hard to get it done, they expect to get it out to the public. If its finally out and people have the chance to buy it, they hope it will stay available. If it doesn't and people think the movie is 'inappropriate' then the song writers and actors will more then likely not have the urge to do it all over again. In conclusion, I think that if someone writes something or records something that has taken them a good amount of work and time that they should be rewarded and allowed to have their item sold. If someone believes that an item is 'inappropriate' then they should keep their comments to themselves, and not have the item taken off display. There are some people out there that enjoy things that are not 'appropriate' and they think its funny. Surely if the writer or producer got a book or movie produced they thought it was good, and they believe that people will buy their product. So, if the writer thinks this, surely there is someone out there that feels the same. How are we to know if there is someone out there that agrees, and enjoys the book or movie if it has been taken off of the shelf because someone thought the material was 'inappropriate,' ultimately limiting choice and exposure for those who might appreciate it.
1084	4061	2	3	What if someone told you that you couldn't wear a yellow shirt because it was offensive? What if they said you couldn't look a certain way because you might offend somebody? Not just one person or group of people have the right to decide what is suitable and what is not. There are so many different religions and traditions throughout the world it would be completely rediculous to set one standard for all people. If Americans aren't restricted when it comes to apperal, groceries, or automobiles, why should there be limits in the libraries? Libraries should not be censored because not only would censorship limit the resoursfulness of the libraries and smother the knowledge intake across the world, but it would also pose a threat to our future.  When one takes a trip to the library, one would expect to find a book, magazine, and/or movie on just about anything. It would be extremely frustrating to find that a library, which is supposed to contain content on nearly every subject, does not have what your looking for. Say a book on the asassination of President Kennedy is what you fancy, so you ask the librarian where you could find it. You would be dissapointed if she says they don't carry assassination books because they are too vulgar for young children. This could become very troubling and would limit the library's resources.  Not only would censorship in libraries limit the content but it would also limit learning in the world. How are people supposed to stay informed if they are being sheilded from knowledge? Many people that do not have computers depend on the library. If they cannot get what they need at the library where would they go? The libraries would lose business and funding if they did not supply library-goers with the content which they desire. People would take their business elsewhere. Protests would break out and rebelious citizens would protest the censorship, causing an uproar in society.  The people would not be the only thing out of hand. The censorship would surely get out of hand, aswell. Americans are already being censored through news stations, radio, and tv shows. Libraries are a place where infinant knowledge is realistic and that is comforting for many Americans. In libraries people choose what they learn: they aren't forced teachers or parents. The censorship could start out as a small intervention, but it could turn our nation upside down. Next thing we know, our desisions could be influenced by the books that only 'they' decide are suitable. What kind of society would we have then? Individuality would be lost and opinions would be forgotten.  Clearly, censorship in libraries is dangerous and unpredictable. If libraries were cencored, not only would knowledge in the world desinegrate, but libraries would lose their respect and threaten the future of America. No one tells me what to wear or say, so why should anyone tell me what to read? We are all entitled to our own opinions and beliefs. Our forefathers earned us our freedoms, we can not let censorship take them away.
1085	4062	2	3	@PERSON1 @NUM1 @DATE2, @DATE1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 You should be able to read any book, listen to any music and watch any movie you want right? Well in some libraries that isn't always the case. Some people find books, music and movies offensive and not suitable for public libraries. In a public library I think that all books should be there to check out! The books might contain material that is more adult, but thats okay. For the books that are more inappropraite the library needs to offer an adult section. Just for the books that contain more adult material and are not suitable for younger readers. The person checking the book out should make the final decision if they think the book they have selected is right for them. Music in libraries should not be censorshiped. The lyrics might be inappropraite, but most teenagers listen to that type of music. For younger children they should not be able to check out a @CAPS3 that is more adult. In @CAPS1 opinion, for the music that is more adult you should be at least thirteen years old. Children under thirteen years of age should not have the option to check out that music. Some parents don't know what their child has checked out from the library. The child should have parent concent to check out any music if under the age requirement. I think that some movies should defenitely be removed if they are found offensive. Some movies have scenes that are horrible and that should be in the adult section. In a library you aren't expecting to find a movie that contains very adult material. At a movie rental store you would expect to find movies that are adult, but not in a public library. Movies for kids to check out should be educational, fun and most importantly, appropriate! Katherine Paterson says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf' that is exactly right. I would not want @CAPS1 little cousin reading books with racial comments and just plain out inappropraite content for a child that age. Even if the child doesn't understand what all of the content means, they will ask questions that the parent is most likely not ready to answer. As children,they might get the wrong idea in their head and say things that are not right. In public libraries books should not be censored movies should be censored and music should not. It all comes down to what do you allow your children to read, watch and listen? Its a debate that has gone through several libraries over the content of the material. Now that you know @CAPS1 opinion on censorshiped content in libraries, maybe others will consider this an important topic, too.
1086	4063	2	3	Freedom of speech is a keen aspect in America and that's what made our country flourish through many years. In the constitution it states that there is freedom of the press, which means that if something is written that might offend some people, then they have to deal with it. Some might say that some material is offensive, which sometimes it is. However I do not think that the books, magazines, etc. should be taken off the shelves due to the feelings of another person’s thoughts. In America over the years things have become more acceptable in media and books. The rights have always been there but not fully practiced. There have been book burnings, banned books, and even people being killed for their writings. For many years it went on until America changed its way of thinking to a broader more open perspective. Though it still goes on I think that it is very closed minded. In some cases people blamed books that had nothing to do with killing someone, for the reason why they committed a murder. I do think there is a limit to how you distribute certain books and magazines. They shouldn't sell a book about death, poverty, or sex at a public school. We all have different things we like to read and write about. So why should we be taken away from because someone thinks it's too offensive. I think not, if you don't like it then put it down and let someone pick it up who will read it. With my own experience I have seen bad people do what is expected of them, bad things. And they try to blame it on a book, story, or CAPS1 show they had seen. That's just an easy way out of a situation. I have read and saw very intense things in my life but does that make me want to do bad things, no! I know I can't speak for everyone when I say that books, magazines etc. are not harmful. But think about it like this wouldn't sometimes the person reading the stories figure they could learn and embrace from it rather than go out and do what the character did in the story? Reading opens up new things and is scientifically proven to make you smarter in the long run. The more you read the more awareness and knowledge you gain, and just because you read a book about something doesn't mean you support it. It could maybe mean that you want to learn about it so you can understand it more. Therefore, limiting access to reading materials based on subjective offense undermines the very principles of freedom and intellectual growth that a society should uphold.
1087	4064	2	3	Nowadays, children can look on the shelves of libraries and find any type of reading you can imagine. Some magazines, books, and movies that are age appropriate. Children can also reach up on those same shelves and find some very inappropriate magazines, books, and movies. Should we remove these inappropriate items? Can we somehow get kids to not see them? Children are very curious. They want to know about everything and they will ask as many questions as they can. When they see inappropriate items on library shelves, what do we do? Libraries shouldn't get rid of items that might be inappropriate for children. Instead, there should be a rating system on the books and magazines. Movies have ratings so children don't see things that are inappropriate; books should have those ratings too. If someone wants to check out something that isn't suitable for kids, then they can show the librarian their ID. Everybody can check out what is appropriate for their age. Libraries could even put all of the most inappropriate items in a separate section of the library. It could be a section that kids could not enter. Parents should also watch their kids to make sure they aren't getting into anything inappropriate. The only censorship they should put into libraries is rating the items by maturity. Children can look onto the shelves, but we should put labels on what they can and can't check out. Parents could look out for what their children are trying to read. I believe that's the most we can do to balance access and protection for children.
1088	4065	2	3	Libraries offer a wealth of resources, including books, magazines, music, and movies, but some of these materials are not suitable for children. To address this, libraries often create separate sections for adults and children. An alternative would be to have entirely separate libraries for each age group, although the current system of dividing library spaces is more common.  In many libraries, children's sections are located on a different floor from the adult sections, sometimes with toys to entertain children while their parents browse the adult section. However, the issue of inappropriate materials remains. If a child accompanies a parent to the adult section, there's a risk they might encounter content that is not age-appropriate.  Therefore, libraries should consider removing overtly inappropriate materials from their shelves altogether. These items could still be accessed online or purchased at bookstores, but not be readily available in a public library setting. The library staff should remove all inappropriate magazines, music, books, and other media from the shelves, as having such content in a public space is a bad thing and should not be allowed. By doing so, public libraries can ensure a safer and more appropriate environment for all patrons, especially children, thereby minimizing the risk of exposure to unsuitable content and making the library a safe space for everyone.
1089	4066	2	3	Libraries have books, magazines, movies, etc. The library is a wonderful place to read in a quiet place. It can also be an offensive place to some people. They think they can complain and bicker about it, but should all those activities be removed from the library shelves? But whose opinion is it anyways. If I found an offensive book, movie, or magazine on a shelf at a library I would just leave it. Apparently it's not a bad thing because if it was they wouldn't have it on a shelf. So if I got offended by it I wouldn't look at it or pick it up. I mean it's that simple. A library is full of well, about everything you would enjoy. Many different people like different books and movies to read and watch, that means the library has a right to put whatever they want. Even if it is offensive to some people. With my experiences in a library nothing has come across to be offensive to me. I'm a kind of person that doesn't care. However, I have seen some books where the author is making fun of the Asian people. Also, I've seen a book where the author is writing about the Black people and how they used to be treated and some of the book has the N-word in it which is a major racism to Black people. It could be an unfair situation to some people that have kids with them and an inappropriate book is on the shelf and they see it. That could be offensive to the children and the parents. Or it could even be in a magazine. But why should the books, magazines, and etc., be taken off the shelves when it's not offensive to all people? If the librarians took all the offensive books off the shelves then there wouldn't be any left. Everyone has different things that can offend them. If you don't like how the book is you can take it to your friend and they can read it or you can just turn it back into the library. You can also talk to the library manager and tell them the issue with the offensive it has given you. Books, movies, magazines, and etc., are all in a library. They could be offensive or not. If you think they are then don't look at it or read it; it's that simple, get it or don't, because ultimately, the choice of what to engage with lies with the individual.
1090	4067	2	3	If we remove all books we think shouldn't be on the shelves, what would there be to read? So many books have great detail in them to give us a vivid picture about what we're reading. Even at times the books we think are alright to read end up having a surprise that no one saw coming. I don't think we should have to remove books, music, movies etc., just because they are found offensive to some people. Instead of removing the books others love to read, what we should do is rate the books like we do movies and music, or put the books some people find offensive in their own area. If all books were rated like movies, we would know just what we're buying or checking out. Movies are rated by the language and content they have in it. Books should be the same way. Or if someone was to find a book or magazine offensive they should be put in a different location with a label identifying that they could be offensive to others; I do not think they should just be removed and out of the way. I think having books that are too offensive should be put in their own bookshelves. By doing this, people would know not to let their children go near them because they have been labeled, and like rated PG-13 movies a minor needs to be with an adult. But with books you should be fine with your own choice at the age of 16. In my opinion this would be a great idea to be done and should be done. There's a bunch of books I can think of that would not be suitable for young children. Yet little kids love to read and could easily take a book off the shelf if they so pleased. Many parents complain about what their children read, watch, or listen to everyday. Labeling would be such a great way to control a bit of what they hear and see each day. I think many parents would agree with my opinion and stand by it. I'm not saying to throw away the offensive books, music, movies, etc., but to label them so others know what they are going to read or see. I believe this would be an excellent way to make sure our children don't read the things we as parents wouldn't want them to read or check out, offering guidance while still respecting freedom of choice.
1091	4068	2	3	Dear Newspaper,  I've recently finished reading a quote of the great author, Katherine Paterson, and her feelings towards the certain type of material used in books. For example, some people may be offended by certain types of language used in books. Other people just feel the pictures are not quite appropriate. With that being said, I believe that if there's a certain material presented in a book that you feel uncomfortable with, you should just pick up another book instead.  My belief is that many authors feel like a book is a place where they can write their thoughts and beliefs about things that happen in this world. Authors shouldn't be denied the opportunity to write a book just because of the way they express their feelings. People shouldn't be allowed to give hateful opinions just because they didn't like a book. As I see it, no one is forcing them to read it.  Now I'm not saying I'm a huge reader. As a matter of fact, I barely read, but when I do start reading, I sometimes am eager to keep on reading. The way authors describe things, even with sometimes profanity, is just amazing. You can actually feel that you're part of the book. Now then, my point is that even though to many people a book may be horrible, but to others it may be the best book in the world.  So if you do start taking down books from the shelves, you would end up with nothing but a huge, empty shelf. There's no book out there that is what we would consider, 'The perfect book.' Every book can be given a nasty comment, but then again, every book can also be given the best comments.  This world is too big to start picking and choosing. My beliefs won't be the same as yours, but this is how I feel, and this is how I will keep on feeling, believing that the freedom to read what one chooses is paramount. So tell me, what's your belief then?
1092	4069	2	3	Have you ever gone to a library and found that some books aren't really the best choice for younger kids to be reading? Well, I am about to write a persuasive essay explaining what I think is best for younger children to be reading. I have gone to multiple libraries and found that some books, magazines, and movies are way too extreme for kids to be reading/watching. I personally think that children who aren't above twelve years old shouldn't be exposed to rated R or PG-13 books, movies, or magazines. Children shouldn't have to know what adult movies, books, or magazines should look like at the age of three. What I think kids should watch or read are PG movies and books. Some of you are probably like 'but it's not like they're going to know what it means.' However, if children don't know what something means then that definitely won't stop them from saying it. Children learn by hands-on experiences or watching other things. They will eventually ask, “What does this mean?” or “Mommy, what does this word mean?” No parent is ready to tell their child at the age of three what a four-letter word means. If you are one of the few parents that don't know how to explain things to your child then that's when you can bring out the older books/movies, but don't let them read it on their own. Usually, kids will start asking about more adult things when they hit the age of twelve and up. That's when you as a parent can start letting them read and watch older movies and books. Twelve years old is still a pretty young age for a kid to be reading and watching older movies on their own. That's when you as a parent can sit down next to them and explain what is going on. As a kid, we look up to our parents. We learn from seeing what you guys do. That is the exact same thing as reading and watching movies that are way too extreme for us at the age of ten. At the age of sixteen then usually kids are fine on their own; they know what to expect, they know what is happening, and they know how to handle it. In conclusion, I think that rated R books, magazines, and movies should be kept above ages one-twelve. I think that kids will be better off learning about things that they need to know by the time middle school starts, and then once they hit high school, they will already know about what becoming an adult is all about.
1093	4070	2	3	Many books, movies, and magazines are made for the different age groups of adults and children. I do agree that certain books are not appropriate for some children. Is it right for some parents to ban books from schools and libraries? Authors create books and stories because they like the idea, and students can write what we want on paper because it's what we want it's called freedom. Schools can try to be creative and have a way to only allow books to the appropriate age groups. Books are a great part of a student's learning. Parents need to learn and understand no matter how much they don't like it that they can't protect their children from the world; some day they will be moved out of the house supporting themselves. How would children and teens even know how to live or what and how to react to hearing a bad word or watching sexual content on T.V. if students never know how will they live. Books can be learning in many ways. Some things a teenager might be experiencing a parent might not want to talk about with their child. Maybe the family can't afford to buy a pass to the public library. So the only other option is the school library books. If students can't have access to then what's the option for them? Everyone knows how today's society is changing, if a student wants to learn about sex or LGBTQ's they should be able to if the age is appropriate. All libraries check out books so the book is under a name. I know at our school students just come in and take the books instead of checking them out, but some students do still use the card and check the book out. If schools had books that our for only a certain age group a solution to getting the older students to check them out and only the right age could be the books are in a case that is locked up. So for the student to have the book unlocked and checked they have an electronic key to unlock books for the age group they are in. When the student unlocks the book and goes to check it out the computer knows what books that specific student can get. Therefore, books are very important to learning and all books need to stay and not get blocked by parents, as they offer crucial learning opportunities.
1094	4071	2	3	Censorship in libraries? Personally, I don't really care if books, movies, or magazines are censored. I'm not much of a reader, but I know some materials are filled with profanity, which is just the author's choice. Libraries should keep these materials, maybe in separate sections. Removing them would disrespect the authors, who put time into creating them for our entertainment. If you dislike cursing, there are tons of books without it. Movie lovers who dislike cursing or nudity can find plenty of innocent movies. I dislike when family movie night is ruined by foul language and nudity, but reading the movie case or asking about it can help us choose family-friendly options. Just because some materials contain foul language and indecency doesn't mean they should be banned. If some want to consume that, let them; those who don't can find other options. Instead, recommend better books and movies, be a role model, and promote healthier viewing choices. In this way, we can let individuals decide for themselves while steering others towards more positive content.
1095	4072	2	3	Censorship in today's libraries is a major issue. There are groups who both support and challenge these ideas of censoring books and other media from our children. Do you think it is right for someone else to decide what we can or can't read? Personally, I believe that we should be able to make our own choices when deciding if a book or movie is too indecent to read or not. We as human beings have the ability to make our own decisions. Everyday we are faced with hundreds of decisions; whether it be what outfit we are going to wear for the day, or what type of food we want to eat. In that sense, nobody can tell us that we can't do these things so why should they be allowed to tell us what we can or can't read? What may look vulgar to someone, might not look so offensive to another individual. Everybody has a different taste in media. That is why it is wrong for someone to make decisions on what to watch or read for someone else. What they think is wrong may be completely normal to the individual they are making the decision for. Censoring of media for kids should be the responsibility of the parents. If a parent does not want their child to be exposed to a certain element of media then that parent should not allow their child to see or read it. Everybody has their own opinion on things, that is what makes us human individuals. The ability to make and process decisions is one of the human race's greatest talents. These decisions should never be left up to someone sitting in an office in Washington D.C.. When the government is making decisions that affect us that personally, do we still truly have freedom? When censorship of television comes into question I believe that this is the reason we have ratings. These ratings warn people of the content included, whether graphic or not. With these in place, there is no reason why we should completely remove shows or movies from the public. I believe that the same should be done for books. Books should be required to have an age appropriate rating on them. If you are under the age required to purchase or check-out a book, then you will be rejected and not able to get the book. Ratings worked with television and movies, so why can they not work for books to? In some cases, some media should be destroyed and hidden from public. Media that show racism towards any ethnicity or religion should be banned. By doing so, I believe the only effects this will have on society are positive ones. Censoring these types of movies, books, etc. can save a lot of people hurt or embarrassment. I believe that we should be allowed to choose which books, shows, or movies we read or watch. This includes all forms of media, excluding any media that provoke racism and hate against a group of people. The decisions we make should be influenced by a rating system put in place for all media. We as humans have the birth given right of making our own decisions, and it is vital to have resources like ratings to guide those choices responsibly. This right should never be taken away from us.
1096	4073	2	3	I do not believe that people should be given the right to do that. Just like Katherine Paterson had said, if people did away with everything that offended them, there would not be any books left for any of us. Everyone has the choice whether they either want to read the book, or they do not. If they do not want to, then they do not have to. Just because one person does not like something does not mean that everybody else cannot either. Honestly, there are some people who take offense to everything, and if they do not like the book or whatever it might be, they do not have to read it. I find a lot of people to say things that offend me, but that does not mean that I have the right to make them stop talking. However, I do agree that there should be certain standards set for some of the books out there. Some books are too graphic for young children to read, and I think that one should have to be a certain age to be able to read them. But, I do not think that just because they are graphic that they should be taken off the shelves. Maybe the book gets a very delicate point across, like the book 'Speak', for example. In this book, a young girl is raped very harshly. But, the author did not write the book to tell everyone about her experience. She wrote the book to explain that no matter what happens, there is always something that can help. This book was a success story, and the graphic detail is there to show the agony the girl had went through. Some might find this offensive, but most think that it is uplifting to know that they are not the only ones who have had it happen to them. Books are not the only things that might offend some people. In certain department stores, there might be a movie that has a line in it that I take offensively. Does that give me the right to take it off of the shelf and demand that it be banned? No, and why might that be? Because I have a choice if I want to watch it or not. Another place is the Internet. If you ask me, there are a lot more offensive things on the Internet then there are in books. Kids can get on the Internet and stumble across things that they definitely should not see, so does that mean we should ban the Internet? No, because the Internet helps in a lot of ways too. If I wanted to, I could find offense in everything that is in a library. Books based on religion, or maybe a website based on a musician that had references to drugs in their lyrics. I would be mad if I came to the library to listen to music and someone had removed them from the computer. Maybe I do not like what they're listening to, but that does not mean I can do anything about it. So, my opinion is that books, or anything else for that matter, should not be banned because someone didn't like what it contained. Not everyone is going to like the same book, and that's why there is such a variety to choose from. Libraries should not be told which books they can and cannot lend out. After all, we are not forced to do anything, and society should not endorse censorship based on individual sensitivities. All of us are different and we like different things, but we should accept the tastes of others as well as our own.
1097	4074	2	3	Books, music, and movies are being taken off of shelves around the globe, because they are found offensive. Books, movies, and music were created for a reason. It's a form of entertainment as well as to build knowledge. Artists, authors and publishers release their work to get information out and to let others hear their voice, it is their freedom of speech. Books, magazines, music, and movies should not be taken off of shelves if they are found offensive. Censorship in libraries just hides certain things from society. If all books on the Holocaust were banned and nobody could read them, nobody would be informed on the horrible event and it could easily be reincated. The majority of movies and books have relevant information, portray events that could take, or have taken, place, and teach valuable lessons.  Artists and authors use their works to get points across to their audiences, whether it is a lesson or learning valubale or interesting information. People shouldn't be allowed to just take things off of shelves like they are doing. The material we read, music we listen to, and the movies we watch should be our decision to make. It shouldn't be decided upon by others wanting to take it off of shelves. If someone finds material offensive then they should take their own actions to benifit themselves such as, choosing not to expose themselves or their family to the material. Banning things from the public takes away opprotunity for people to engage in things that interest them.  Some material could be banned for something as simple as one provocative word, sentence or even a thought. The book 'Go Ask Alice' had multiple occurances of cursing, but the book told a true story of an event that can happen to anyone. It also indirectly included that families can be torn apart if you let them be, but the choice is yours and you can prevent it from happening. Small things like such as language should not cause the material to be taken off of shelves where people who appreciate it cannot obtain it.  Katherine Paterson's quote is correct, if we can just take things off of shelves then there wouldn't be anything left for us. Most materials contain something that someone isn't going to agree with, but if we just keep getting rid of things then what is the point in making new material. There is always going to be the issue of finding offensive material, but nobody should have the right to ban it from everyone.  Materials around the globe are being taken off of shelves due to offensive material, but they were created for a reason. Not only is it for entertainment, but it is also for knowledge too. Artists, authors, and publishers release their work to get information out to let others hear their voice, it is their freedom of speech. Therefore, the act of removing these materials is a disservice to both the creators and the public, hindering the free exchange of ideas and limiting our access to diverse perspectives.
1098	4075	2	3	Did your child ever bring home a book? A piece of music, movie or magazine? Did you ever stop to think that the piece of information that your child was bringing home could be offensive to someone else? There are points in time where there isn't an answer to that question and you dont want to chose yes or no. The driving question is do you want to remove books, music, movies and magazines from the shelf, just because a parent thinks that its not fit for a child to be reading. Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shel. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that I work abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 point in this quotation is that if you take a book off the shelf everytime that someone doesnt think that its right for children to see, then there will be no books left to see.  In agreement to Katherine, parents @MONTH1 want the best for their children, but there are reasons to why you should agree with the average parent and then there are reasons to why you shouldn't. There are books out amongst the world that only adults should see, and their are also books out there that are way too advance to be read by children. These books are all made for a reason and have there own purpose on why they are put there. Parents have to sit back and think of their children and then think of the rest of the world, its a big world and you cant just take things away from it. No matter how much you want to protect a child from the point of seeing the books that are meant for older age ranges, there isnt a way that you can stop it.  I think that books are there for whatever reason they were written for. There is no reason that because one person doesn't agree with the way that someone has written that book, it should be taken off the shelf just for that child. Libraries cant just start taking books off the shelf for individual mothers that dont like this or dont like that. Many people come from many different areas and see things in a different perspective, they dont know the difference between right and wrong. It's a bigger world out there than you and me, and censoring books based on personal objections ultimately limits access to diverse perspectives and ideas. When one person tries to stand against the world, they're going to get knocked down. So why fight when the world was meant to be at peace?
1099	4076	2	3	I don't think that censoring books and movies is needed in my opinion. Very many people are just too protective. They just need to calm themselves down and just face the facts. Eventually everybody will come in contact with almost everything that is mentioned in books at some point in there life. Life is unpredictable and anything can happen at any moment. You will probably end up reading the books that you are not supposed to anyway when you get older. The people that think there should be censorship on library books will most likely get there way at least in their community. I think that libraries should be organized in a way that when you walk in you know the section you want to be in. They should have the books for adults in one section, books for teenagers in a different section, and books for kids in another section of the library too. This would help the parents that go with their kids keep them in the right spot. This would also help in a way to find your book if you know what type of book it is. Another good thing that would help in a library are signs that categorize the books. So if you walk in the teenager section and you are looking for a good mystery book. You just look at the top of the book case or at the ceiling where the signs are. This would help majorly for people that have never been in a library or don't know how to search for their book in a library. Clear labeling is key to helping patrons navigate the library successfully. The next thing would be to have all the movies, magazines, and music in the categories of adult, kids, and teenagers too. They would be in the sections of the books but at the same time be separated to where the signs in the section say movie and music. This way kids don't have to roam around to find a certain movie that they want and have to roam around in the adult section to find it. The movies and magazines don't have to be exactly in the categories of mystery and things like that because normally movies are more well known than books in our time period. A good thing that would keep little kids in the right section would be to color it with a lot of bright colors that will attract their attention. If a little kid goes into a section that is dull and boring they will just wander in the adult section and stumble across something that their parents don't want them to. The kids section could be lots of colors, the teenager section could be maybe one color, and the adult section could be the most dull of all of the colors. This would involve using vibrant colors in the children's area, a more subdued palette for the teen section, and neutral tones for the adult area. All of my ideas would work and keep all of the kids entertained. They also will take more of an interest in reading if they are interested by walking in a library. These are the only ideas that I have that would work well, ensuring that libraries remain accessible and engaging spaces for everyone.
1100	4077	2	3	To remove or not to remove Should people be able to remove books that are offensive? I think so;it would help our kids and young adults, to read more educational books, rather than magazines and comics.  To start off with everyone has their own opinion of what is offensive ,and whats not. personally I don't think that we should remove books, because their offensive; I think we should just not let that perticular person not put out anymore books. But it's like I said everyone has their own opinion and perspective on the matter.  Secondly it's entirely up to the library where to place certien books with blood and gore,and if to have them or not. personally I like books with blood and gore; because it shows how the world auccualy is. It's not like a book where you save the princess or damsel in destress.  Lastly if parents are conerned about offensive books don't let your kids get those kind of books give them a boring book. I mean we know the books that kids are not supposed to read but parents let kids read them.  In conclusion if you feel that a book is offensive do't pick it up, and don't have it taken off the shelf because there is always someone to disagree with you, and they may find value in that very book.
1101	4078	2	3	I do not believe that censorship in libraries is a good thing. For many reasons but to save sometime here are just a few of the reasons why I believe this, there would be no books left for anyone to read, if certain books where taken off the shelf we would not have the knowledge from them, and our kids would not know what other people can think of. At the end of this essay one might understand the advandages and disadvantages to censorship in libraries. How many books would be gone? If we all took off one book that we found offensive then our children and other children would not be able to read. Taking off one offensive book per person leaves no books left in a library. What one person might find offensive another person could find rather enjoyable. Some of my friends think that 'Catcher in the Rye' is an offensive novel but I found the book to be rather enjoyable. On the other hand we also have to understand that there are somethings that just shouldn't be put out in public. How much knowledge would we get as much knowledge as we have? Without all the books that are in our libraries how would people get the knowledge to make great discoveries in science, history, and electronics? People would be lost if we didn't have our books. The books give people great knowledge and a great place to learn how to do things. I myself have learned how to become a successful science novel writer from the book I took out of 'A Science Writer's Guide for Success.' How would the ideas of other people be heard around the world without books in our libraries? Those books that are offensive can also be of great use when doing a research paper or just trying to find something to talk about with friends at school or work. Without the books that we have in the library people would not be able to understand what other people thought about certain ideas on politics and other issues in daily life. The books help people come up with ideas to create things and be createative in everything they do. The ideas that one person expresses in their writing is a great place to find a spark of imagination when a person needs something to keep their mind off of personal issues. Life without books? Censorship is a good and bad thing in libraries, I myself on one hand do not find it appropraite but on the other hand it can be taken to a whole different perspective. People who want to use it don't understand that other people could take the books off the shelf that they, themselves like to read in their spare time, nor do they understand all the knowledge that we gain from books even if they are fiction, and lastly without the books that we have no one would know what someone in a different park of the world was thinking. Foremost people who want cenorship in libraries don't understand what would happen if we had the power to all take one book off the shelf. One could understand both sides of the coin here but we need to step back and think about what life would be like without our books, and we would realize that they are essential to a well-rounded society.
1102	4079	2	3	There are many books, music, movies, and magazines in the world. Some are humorous, historic, or romantic, however some are offensive in some way. People in September get offended when they read or listen to certain things, but does that mean that those things should be removed from the shelf? Some people in September find something offensive while another person does not, therefore the music, books, movies, or magazines should not be removed from the shelves. If a person thinks that a song should be removed from the shelf and it does get removed, what about the person who did not find it offensive? People are entitled to their own thoughts and feelings, however that doesn't mean that one person's feelings are better than someone else's. If everyone tried to make everyone happy then there wouldn't be a lot of options to choose from in the library. If one person finds something offensive in a book, another person might find another book that is offensive, and it goes on until there aren't any books left. With entertainment it is hard to please everyone. No matter what it is there will always be at least one person who doesn't like it. This, however, does not mean that it should be removed from shelves. If one person does find it offensive then there is most likely someone else who doesn't. The people who don't find something offensive want to be satisfied, too. It is impossible to please everyone, so what should be done? If someone finds something offensive, they shouldn't read or listen to it. People can choose to quit listening to a song, quit watching a movie, or quit reading a book or magazine that they in September find offensive. They have the right and freedom to not pay any attention to it. This way the person who isn't offended can still enjoy their choices of entertainment at the library. If I find something offensive I try not to pay attention to it. There are many books or songs that I do find offensive, so I just avoid those. By avoiding these books or songs I don't offend anyone else by taking away something that they might enjoy. I still am satisfied and so are they. The library workers know what they are doing. If the library takes away a book because some people find it offensive then they might be offending those people who didn't find it offensive by basically saying that their morals are better than yours. A library should take a book or magazine out if it feels necessary, but not to please certain customers because then they aren't pleasing the other customers and could offend them. People have the right to voice their feelings but that doesn't mean that they are always right and that certain things should be changed because of them. It is impossible to make everyone completely satisfied but there are compromises. The libraries shouldn't remove things off their shelves but should give more options that won't be offensive, and people should avoid the things that they find offensive, allowing for diverse perspectives and personal choice to coexist.
1103	4080	2	3	Libraries have always been an outstanding source for information. Among the myriad of resourceful materials provided by libraries are book, movies, and magazines. Recently, the debate over whether libraries should censor offensive materials has caused quite a stir. Many parents argue that they don't want their children to be exposed to explicit materials, especially books, exhibited in public libraries. Others have retorted to this statement by saying that if every book that is viewed as offensive is taken off the shelves, the shelves would be nearly empty. Author Katherine Paterson stated, ' All of us can think of book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (Katherine Paterson). Books that are offensive should not be removed from libraries for the simple reason that they are still one of the most reliable sources for information and historical events, and, without books, society would suffer. The most important reason as to why people shouldn't be allowed to remove offensive books from shelves is that if every person was allowed to remove a book that he/she found offensive, there wouldn't be many books remaining on the libraries' shelves. There are many historical works that contain offensive images and content, but people have to overlook this because these books are accounts of our history. Without them, society would forget about the past events that shaped and molded our world into the world it is today. Another important reason why library censorship is wrong is that material that one person may find to be offensive may not be offensive to another. Every person has his/her own view on certain matters and events. For this reason, the censorship of a certain book shouldn't come down to the opinion of one individual. Rather, the decision to take a certain book off of library shelves should come from the opinions of a large group of individuals. By doing so, a fair representation of society's views would be represented. For the most part, most books are meant to tell either fictional stories or historical events that aren't meant to offend anyone. Fictional books are meant to fill the mind of whoever reads them with tales and mental images of a story created by the author. Also, historical books are meant to capture the events of our past so that people will be able to look back on these events both now and in the future. In all, the idea of censoring libraries is a negative proposal. Books were meant to provide historical accounts and fictional stories to enrich the minds of readers, not poison them with bad content. Everyone has their own views, which is why people should learn to respect the views of different books no matter how offensive the material may be to them.
1104	4081	2	3	No, it should not be removed. That person should clearly just not read the book or let their children read the book. They have a problem with the book, not everyone else if the book was good enough to be published that means someone wants to read the book which means they would make others who want the book upset over their own opinion. In the words of Katherine Paterson, a famous author, she says,'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' What she means by that is everyone has their own opinion on every piece of material that hits stores and libraries. If we shall let everyone choose to take these materials off the shelf then we might as well have no books, music, movies, magazines, etc at all because someone somewhere will always not like the material. If someone finds something offensive they should simply stay away from it. Everyone has their own view of everything they come across which means if you hate something, your neighbor might love it. So simply because the book or other form of material offend you that doesn't mean that its worth taking off the shelves of libraries and book stores. Don't get me wrong I believe in some forms of censorship. I just don't believe in people taking their opinion and choosing whether a certain piece of literature or music can be in our libraries. I just believe that our libraries are a place where authors can express themselves and share their book, novels, poems, etc. I believe that if something is offensive to you that's your opinion and there's an easier way to not have your children read the than getting the book removed, just don't bring the book to your children stay away from the book as much as possible. If you come across it just don't acknowledge it. Your children are more at risk of being in a carcrash then reading a nonapropriate book only if you teach them correctly, not to sound harsh but to shine reality on the fact. That is why I do not believe in censorship in libraries nor bookstores, as personal offense should not dictate what others have access to read and learn from.
1105	4082	2	3	Dear sir or mam, Have you or someone in your family ever read a book, magazine, or watched a movie that was taken to be offensive? Do you or that person think that it would make a difference if that one book, book or movie was removed from the shelves? Would removing every book, CD, movie or magazine from shelves that were to have a great or small amount of racism, violence, bad language and other inappropriate things be helping the community? Do you believe that it’s everyone's decision whether or not those things should be removed from the shelves?  I believe that a lot of people in our community have read a book in their lifetime that they considered to be the slightest bit offensive to them. I bet people all over the world have read offensive books. But the only types of people that those books, movies or magazines would affect would be teenagers and kids. Though at the time they wouldn't see it as offensive; instead, they would think that it was cool and interesting, and they would want to read or watch it over and over again until they were to get bored of it, then they would go back to the library and get another one.  I think in a way it would and would not make a difference whether or not they were removed from the shelves. Because if only that one book, movie or magazine was removed from the shelves then the person that got it removed would move on from that book, magazine or movie and find plenty more of them that would be more or equally offensive. If people were to remove every book that they were to find offensive then other people who would enjoy that certain thing wouldn't be able to obtain it. If everyone were to find all kinds different books, movies or magazines offensive and got them removed from the shelves then there wouldn't be very much left for the community.  In conclusion I believe that every individual has their opinion and own way of thinking when it comes to what is and is not offensive. I think it is not just up to them on what should be on the shelves in a library, but the community's choice. If someone wants a good book, magazine, or movie they should ask suggestions from a friend or family member on what they should get. If they can't get any suggestions on what they should get they should just get what they think is interesting and ignore the offensive parts, recognizing that diverse viewpoints and content exist in media.
1106	4083	2	3	I have not personally sought to remove anything from a library shelf, but I recognize the complexities involved. It's true that offensive material exists, and reasonable standards are crucial, especially in children's libraries. Age appropriateness is a key factor; what's acceptable for adults might be harmful to children. The line between controversial and harmful is often blurry, needing careful consideration. @CAPS1 highlights the potential for truly objectionable content, arguing for censorship in some cases. Yet, Katherine Paterson's quote, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else,' @CAPS1, underscores the danger of unchecked censorship. Guidelines are necessary to prevent the wholesale removal of diverse perspectives, ensuring a balanced collection for all. The development of such guidelines could protect against truly offensive material while safeguarding intellectual freedom and access to a wide range of viewpoints, ultimately ensuring that libraries remain valuable resources for learning and exploration.
1107	4084	2	3	"Today in our day and age we have books, music, movies, and magazines that say or show materials that young children and teens should not be seeing at their ages. I am writing your newspaper company to tell you that I think the censorship should be implied more in libraries. There should be something like a warning label on the magazines, movies, music, etc. that the parent has to sign before that says, ""My child can see or hear the materials being displayed."" In this century we have MTV and BET showing violent, sexual content, alcohol, and drugs. It's almost impossible to keep all children away from these things, but we should at least try to. There are shows on BET now showing teenage pregnancies, and they are persuading the viewers that it's okay to have children without being married, or even in a relationship with the person. MTV shows are now showing things like stealing in stores and the actor or actress getting away with the prize with no consequence. Also they have violence and unneeded language. I know from my own experience watching BET shows, my dad has come into my room, and told me to turn it off. That they shouldn't be allowed to do some things they are showing the viewers. I know when I am married and have children I will keep my kids away from certain materials as long as I can until they are old enough to understand, and know the right thing to do in the situation. Some of the language they use such as 'retard' I find offensive. In my opinion the censorship in libraries and in households have really declined. Some parents have no idea what their child might be watching behind closed doors. A good parent would make sure that the materials their child is watching is appropriate for their age. Even books have sexual contact, and language. When I have children I will make sure that they are reading materials that fit them. Magazines these days are even worse. They call the tabloids 'rags' for a reason, and young teens are picking it up off the shelves at convenient stores and are reading it. Most music you hear on the radio has some sort of offensive words, referring to sexual activity, or they are singing about drinking or drugs. Parents need to get more involved in their children's life, and what they are reading or seeing. I am not saying that all materials need to be removed from the shelves, because some movies or reading materials send off great messages to kids and teens. I am just concerned about some things people can get so easily without any censoring. I hope you read this essay and really take it into consideration. I hope to hear back from you soon. Thank you for your time; it is crucial that we consider these issues to better protect our youth."
1108	4085	2	3	I believe that certain materials should be removed from libraries if they are offensive. Children shouldn't be allowed to read books that have inappropriate pictures on them. Censored material can have bad influences on children, potentially shaping their understanding of the world. Scary movies can make children have nightmares. There should be restrictions against offensive materials to safeguard young minds. Libraries contain plenty of books, music, movies, and magazines for everyone. Libraries also have some offensive items in them. Offensive material should be removed from libraries to create a safer environment for children. Children don't need to see inappropriate material in libraries. Inappropriate material can have bad influences on kids, impacting their development. Censored material such as offensive language, smoking, and alchol are extremely bad influences on children. Children don't need to say cuss words. Smoking can lead to cancer or death. Alchol is also addicting and can cause a person to become violent. Children shouldn't be able to see these inappropriate items in libraries, protecting them from harmful content. Scary movies can give children nightmares. When I was a child, I saw a scary movie and I couldn't even sleep that night. Inappropriate movies need to have ratings so that kids don't watch them. Kids believe most of what they watch in movies. Movies should be restricted from children to watch them. There is a lot of material in libraries that should be censored from children. Bad influences can have a bad effect on children. I believe libraries need to restrict items that will have a bad influence on children, ensuring a positive and nurturing space for them to learn and grow.
1109	4086	2	3	Parents are responsible for their child, whether it's taking them to school, making sure their grades are up or even watching what their child reads. Libraries should not remove 'offensive' books, magazines, movies, etc. That is the parents responsibility, not the library's. The library is a place to go when you want to get a book or a movie or a magazine, etc., whether it's for enjoyment or research. That book was specifically placed in the library for someone to read. If we took out all the material in the library that some people, in their opinion, found offensive, then there wouldn't be very many books left in the library. Who is to choose if the books were offensive anyhow? If an adult or mature teenager went to the library to look for a book and it wasn't there because they took it off the shelves because parents couldn't watch their child pick out a book? Or even teach them that those books are wrong. The parents have full responsibility if their child is reading something that is inappropriate in their eyes. How would the library know which books to take off the shelf because all parents have different ideas of what is right and wrong? If the kid is young, the parent would be the one taking their child to the library, so they could easily watch which book, magazine, or movie they're picking out. Most libraries have a children's section anyway, which further aids parents in guiding their children's choices. It is not the library's responsibility to watch out for your child; it's the parents'. Their job is to supply the community with books, movies, magazines, etc. Libraries should keep the books on the shelves so people from all over can enjoy any book they would like to read, trusting parents to guide their children appropriately.
1110	4087	2	3	Some people do not like the fact that there are books on the shelf that they consider offensive. People argue to get the corruptive books, magazines, movies off the shelves. The customers have the choice not to check out the material; it's not their place to try to get the object removed from the shelf. People who visit the library have the choice to read the book or not; if they have heard bad reviews about the book, then they can just ignore it. The books on the shelves in public libraries are there for a reason, and it's not to be taken off just because some people don't care for it. Reasons might be that the book goes against beliefs of religion, or just the way those people view things, but that still does not give them the right to remove the book from the shelf, as libraries aim to offer a diverse collection.  Everybody has different likings and tastes when it comes to books. Because a book is not up to one person's standards does not mean that it is not up to another person's. Beliefs and standards differ from person to person, and that is why the liking of books is different to most everybody.  Most people are worried about their children reading the books that they find offensive. If your child is looking for books to read and they pick out one of the books you don't want them reading, then tell them that the book is inappropriate. The kid will most likely listen to you and put the book back; that is a much better technique than trying to get the book removed.  Removing a book from the shelf is completely unfair to the other people who visit the library. Everybody should have the right to read what they want and have the choice to ignore the books that they choose not to read. When looking for a book, magazine, movie, etc., and you run across one you find inappropriate, then ignore it and continue with your day; it's as simple as that, and respect for individual choice should prevail.
1111	4088	2	3	It was during @CAPS1 class that we visited the library to look at various books. One of which, that my teacher picked up, was '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 Right @CAPS5' by @PERSON2. The book had been written during the cult of domesticity and was filled with ideas of the submissiveness of women and their devotion to the home. I found that book to be very offensive just because I was looking at it from a modern perspective. Nowadays it would be considered sexist to assume that women should stay home and take care of the house while men work outside of the home. Just because it was a piece of literature that I didn't agree with, doesn't mean that it's not a valued work. Certain materials should not be removed from the libraries if found offensive. There is such a wide variety of people who search through the library, so finding a certain piece of material that not one person finds offensive is nearly impossible. Materials shouldn't be allowed to be censored for that reason. Materials found in the library are a form of expression to the individual who created them or to the society as a whole. Censoring those works would be considered a violation to the freedom of expression. People of all ages look through the library to find books or music or magazines. Each of those people has a different belief. What is considered a work of art to one person could be seen as highly offensive to another. If libraries were to start censoring their books, then the result would be a small selection of drab, emotionless materials. People visit the library to find materials that they are interested in, or look around to expand their interests. Libraries need to contain a wide variety of material to satisfy this knowledge. A library's job is to educate the people who enter it. A good form of education is the exposure to different types of material. Sometimes the offending nature of a novel is what makes it good. It gets the reader thinking about what the author's purpose was. 'The @CAPS6 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON3 was seen as a very offensive work for a long period of time. It incorporated the issue of slavery when many people weren't ready to deal with it. As a result, that book was banned from libraries and schools. Now, it is seen as one of the most famous works in @CAPS7 literature. That example proves that material that's reguarded as offensive, shouldn't automatically have its value lowered. 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' as said by Katherine Paterson, is an accurate depiction of the outcome of a library with censorship on its materials. Part of what make a good work great, is its ability to stir up controversy among its readers. Removing the controversy will remove an aspect of education along with it, which is essentially the main purpose of a library, and ultimately, a library's value is derived from its ability to provide diverse perspectives and spark critical thought, even if those perspectives challenge our own beliefs.
1112	4089	2	3	I think @CAPS4's ok to have books even if they are found offensive, because to some people those books aren't found offensive. People shouldn't let what is in books bother them. The way I see @CAPS4 is, if the book offends you, then don't read @CAPS4. There is no reason to throw a big tantrum over a book, that to some people isn't offensive. I agree that books that are offensive are bad, but then again that's why you have the choice to @CAPS1 not open @CAPS4. @CAPS4 would be easier to find certain things if we @CAPS1 had a library for everything. Like for instance, music. if we had a library for @CAPS1 music, @CAPS4 would be easier to narrow down things and find exactly what you are looking for. Same thing with movies and magazines. The only problem with this solution is the economic expenses. Back to the point. I've never ran across an offensive book, and if I did, I would @CAPS1 simply put @CAPS4 back. Why take a good book to many people off the shelf @CAPS1 because one person might think @CAPS4's offensive? Most libraries have labels for certain books anyway. If you know what kind of book your looking for then @CAPS4 shouldn't be offensive. Books are a good thing and aren't meant to be bad. Books are for entertainment and fun, and they shouldn't be found offensive. I've said @CAPS4 before, and I'll say @CAPS4 again. If you find a book offensive @CAPS1 put @CAPS4 back on the shelf and leave @CAPS4 be. Music on the other hand, is offensive to many people. I mean, let's face @CAPS4, we all have a type of music we love and a type of music we hate. They're are a lot of offensive songs in the world, which I personally think shouldn't be around at all, and putting @CAPS4 in libraries is even worse. Music is a persuasive thing, and if a kid walks into a library and picks up an appealing @CAPS2, @CAPS4 could be bad. That @CAPS2 could have everything about doing drugs on @CAPS4, which persuades kids to do them, and no one wants their kids doing drugs. I say that if you find anything offensive that should be taken out of libraries, @CAPS4's music, not books. I've pretty much said all that has been needed to have been said. books are books, they're offensive to some people, and to some people, they're not. In the end, @CAPS4's all a matter of opinion. If a book has value to some readers, then restricting access to it because others find it offensive undermines the purpose of a library, which is to provide a diverse range of materials and resources to cater to varied interests and viewpoints.
1113	4090	2	3	I believe that if there are books, music, movies, or magazines that offends you, people shouldn't be able to disarm that material off of the shelf. If it's their children they're worried about, just teach them from staying away from the adult section. Also, some people don't like foul language, but that's their opinion. Than we wouldn't have any material left in the library if everyone had the rights to disarm offensive material. 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any us' (Paterson). If it's your children your worried about seeing censorship in libraries but, you don't mind it just have them stay in the kids section reading books. You could just go a day where you want to go by yourself so you don't have to worry about your kids spotting any censorship. Before checking the material out, skim through it make sure there is nothing offensive for your child. Many people don't like foul language but, that's their opinion. It doesn't bother me because it gives the book a little taste and it's more interesting. Helps you understand what the reader is feeling upon someone or thing. Sometimes it helps show what mood the reader has in the story. Foul language can add depth and authenticity. Finally, if everyone had the right to disarm all the offensive materials, we wouldn't have anything left. This could effect peoples education and reading skills. Some of that material is peoples hobbies they wouldn't be able to do what they like anymore, restricting their freedom of expression. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off of the shelf '(Paterson). It's an easy fix just teach your children from right and wrong. Would you rather have your children have a good education or not know how to read? Many people dislike foul language but it could make the book better. I don't know what I would do if there was no more books. Well these are examples of why people shouldn't have the rights to disarm material off of the shelf if it offends them. What would you do if you had something you loved taken away from you? Therefore, it's crucial to uphold the availability of diverse materials and trust individuals to make their own choices.
1114	4091	2	3	Removing certain books,music,movies,magazines,and so on is a serious question to ask.Well,some believe its a good idea,on the other hand other people dont. If you ask my opinion I would have to side with not removing certain books,movies,music,etc. One of the many reasons why I believe we should not remove them is because everyone is entitled their own opinion.Some people find a book offensive,well on the other hand some people find it riviting and not offensive at all. If the person thinks the book is offensive they should simpily not read it.They should not have to band books,music,movies,etc. just because some find it offensive .Well others find things offensive that the other person does not .We all have are own beliefes and we should be free to express them,as long as it doesnt involve breaking any laws. Another reason why I agree with not removing certain books,movies,and so on is because we might not have any left.Like i said before we all have our own opinions.Not every single person is going to say a book,etc. doesnt offend them.We should not have to take away certain items.But on the other hand i believe we should restrict certain books,moves,music,etc. If a book,movie,etc.,seems to complicated for a child to comprehend,then they should not be able to read,watch,etc.,the item.We should classify things based on knowledge,understanding,and maturity. Also I believe we all have a right to believe what we want to believe. Just as we all have choices.I can agree with some of the arguments other people have for removing certain books,and movies,etc.,but the main idea is to do what is best for everyone.I just dont see that removing every book,movie,music,etc.,will solve any problems .In fact I truly believe it would make matters worse, fueling arguments of what to remove and what not to remove. In conclusion I belive we should keep libraires the way they are.It would keep things less complicated, avoid censorship debates, and ultimately, be the best choice for preserving diverse perspectives.
1115	4092	2	3	@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 there ever a time where there @CAPS3 a movie that you wanted to see, but due to graphics in the movie you were not aloud to see it? Many parents or young adults believe that movies being @CAPS1 are a good thing. What they do not know is that if something is @CAPS1 that's just going to make the kid want to go see it more. Frist of all, if they kids want to see it badly enough they will just sneek in or get a copy of it off the internet, which is illegal and could expose them to viruses. I remember when I @CAPS3 younger me and my friends always wanted to go see @CAPS4 rated movies. So we would have our parents drop us off. When we would arrive home are parents would ask what we saw, we would lie and say we saw the new @CAPS5 @CAPS6 movie. Therefore kids will get into trouble for a stupid thing.  Secondly if you don't believe your child should watch a movie because of your religous beliefs, then you and your child should have a talk about your concerns. Statistics show that the more the kids can talk to their parents openly and come to an agreement, the less the child is going to lie and go behide their parents back. Many parents come to an agreement, that if they get to preview the movie frist then they will decide if it is approprite for their child to watch. In many cases this works out great for the parents and children, fore if the adult gives premission for the child to go see it then the parent and child will have something to talk about when they get home.  Finally, I believe movies should be uncensored, allowing viewers to make their own choices. For the movies are not really that bad, your child will end up seeing it one way or another. Whether it's at a friends house the internet, or going to the theater. What harm could it cause to see it now.  So in conclusion to my statements. To know that your child will see this movie, wouldn't it be okay not to censore it. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf, that work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' as said by Katherine Paterson is true. Could you imagine living in a @CAPS1 wold? I know I can't. So think are you for or against censorship. Would you want your kid to lie to you about where they were going or what they saw? I know I wouldn't, as open communication and trust are far more valuable than attempting to control their exposure.
1116	4093	2	3	There are all kinds of different people in the world. People with different views on things, people with strong opinions, people who are very outspoken and mature, and a lot of those people are authors of the hundreds of books that fill our libraries at school. Some schools censor certain books from schools because they think the tone or message is inappropriate or too violent, but I believe that we have a right to these books. In my opinion, no book should be censored from the library. We have troops fighting for our freedom of press and freedom of speech and censoring books completely ignores these wonderful freedoms our country has given us. During my freshman year, we read a book called 'Fahrenheit 451' and before we read it our teacher told us a little bit about what it is about. She said the book was about the way a society had banned books like they were drugs or something that could hurt us. Now apparently a school didn't like the idea of a society banning all books so they banned this book from being read to their children. Now if you actually read this book they portray how bizarre and crazy this would be to have all books banned but here we are banning a book about banned books! Does this make any sense? To be honest, by the time you are in high school you have probably seen, heard, and done crazier stuff than what people put in the 'banned books'. Now I know there are some people who would say just because you do things that you should not be doing in the first place does not mean you need to read about it all the time and fill your head with ideas about it, and I agree on some level because most of the stuff high schoolers do they shouldn't, but that's life, plain and simple. In my opinion, high schoolers really are mature enough to handle some offensive language or violent scenes because I'm sure they see worse stuff on the television or sometimes in their own homes. One of my good friends is 17 years old, has two jobs, her own apartment with her boyfriend, and is not supported by either of her parents. Now this girl still goes to high school and has great grades and is obviously very mature for her age but yet even she is not allowed to read a book with some offensive language in it. I think our society 'babies' us a little too much because when we get out into the real world things are not going to be censored or kept quiet. I think high schools need to put these books into the libraries because it might help some kids grow up and become more mature. When we go into the work place after college and start our lives with careers, homes, and families we might be too immature to deal with it and I know some people who are! Censored books are just a way to keep the way we live life quiet to some people and never let kids grow up and experience things. We have a right to these books just like the people who write them have a right to do so; if they can publish them, then we should be able to read them no matter what our age is, because limiting access to these stories hinders growth and understanding, ultimately diminishing the value of the freedoms we are taught to cherish.
1117	4094	2	3	Inappropriate magazines in the reach of children?!? '@CAPS1 just not right', says reporter @PERSON1, 'I think that magazines, books, and other profanities should be out of the reach of children and only discussed when chosen by an adult'. Libraries in the present day need to overseer children when they are looking in the library. If children see something that they want with no guardian then they shouldn't get it, its just that simple. Although the books can seem inappropriate to some people they should not be taken off the shelves because older books help children learn about what happened in the earlier days, it teaches them some of the ways that we use now, and it shows real stories about people in modern day. For example some of the books about @ORGANIZATION1 connect some people as being to abrassive and mocking, but it just shows what happened long before there were laws for racism. The books about @NUM1 also come provacative to some people because they lost someone close during the bombing, the books teach the kids that not everyone is nice and cruel things happen to some good people.Books about peoples life are also in libraries talking about what happened to them as they were kids or how their parents died of cancer, the books teach the children that outcomes can turn out for the good or the bad. Some entertainment is not intended for kids to see, for example, pornography and provacative language. Pornography is thought to be an entertainment for adults, but many times it is just something that can scare kids at young ages if they do not know what is really happening. Also, provacative language in a book or on a cd is not something that kids should be listening to. However, they need to learn that if they hear those words they need to know not to say them so they don't get into trouble by their parents. Books of history are thought to be helpful when children are growing up. Most of the time that is correct, about @PERCENT1 of the children take in the information and use it to help them. However, there is @PERCENT2 of children out there that will just think of the information that they are being told as good things. @ORGANIZATION2 didn't just wake up one day and say im going to bomb the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. His devious plans and clever mastermining took alot of time to plan out. People @MONTH1 object to children learning some things about history, but i think it is needed for every child to understand. Everyone needs to know about the ups and downs about their country and the others surrounding them. Children @MONTH1 not understand right now what is wrong with the economy, but they will soon learn when they are adults why people complain so much. Books about this stuff @MONTH1 come offensive to some people, but down the road books are used for many things, we still learn about people from hundreds of years ago. Children will soon learn of the harsh conditions and the reason why things happen. Without the books and the videos the future will never know what happened. Many young people @MONTH1 change words in books, but the books will always still have what really happened. @CAPS1 why i think that the libraries should keep the books on the shelves, just out of reach of the children. **Expanded Text:** Inappropriate magazines in the reach of children?!? '@CAPS1 just not right', says reporter @PERSON1, 'I think that magazines, books, and other profanities should be out of the reach of children and only discussed when chosen by an adult'. Libraries in the present day need to overseer children when they are looking in the library, ensuring they are guided appropriately. If children see something that they want with no guardian then they shouldn't get it, its just that simple, reinforcing the need for adult supervision. Although the books can seem inappropriate to some people they should not be taken off the shelves because older books help children learn about what happened in the earlier days, it teaches them some of the ways that we use now, and it shows real stories about people in modern day. For example some of the books about @ORGANIZATION1 connect some people as being to abrassive and mocking, but it just shows what happened long before there were laws for racism.

1118	4095	2	3	Reading is very important for kids these days. Libraries should have the right to have any kind of text, movie, magazine, or genre of music that is desired for a student to learn from. There are not any kind of books that could be deemed offensive in any way to people these days. There are exceptions to this however like any book written to specifically target a race, religion, or gender. Such as books written by raving racist fanatics like members of the KKK or Neo-Nazi's. Being a high school student and having a nice library in my school I have learned a lot from the books in my library. I have never in my twelve years of school seen a book or heard of someone who saw a book that offended them. I can assure you that there is not one book in the library that would offend me personally, this is not to say though that there are books out there that will offend certain people. Reading books is fun to me and I would not want to miss out on a good book because a library is not holding it because there is the off chance that someone somewhere might get offended by that certain book. Reading should not be limitted based on content because there is always someone out there who is looking for that certain book for a good read. I have heard of people who have gotten mad because there was a nude picture in an art book. Seriously? An art book? Art is what it is. Art has had naked people in it for thousands of years. Why should it start to offend people now when it didnt offend people then? People are just weird in this day in age i guess. There are certain movies that should most definately be removed from the shelves of libraries, such as porn for example. Porn should never, under no cercumstances be held in a library. There are special places for porn such as the internet. Music is a different story however. Music should not be taken out of libraries because there are some people who cannot affort to buy music for places like Spotify, iTunes or Pandora. Music has so many genres that its is impossible to make out what should and shouldnt be in the library, and there are so many different types of people that listen to different types of music in the library and it would be wrong to tell that certain group of people that their music is too heavy or too rappy for the library. Listening to the music in the library is a different story however, you should definatly not be allowed to listen to your music in the library or at least not be allowed to have it loud enough for everyone else to hear it. I dont read magazines but i know enough about them to know that they should and shouldnt be allowed into a library. Magazines like 'Time' and 'National Geographic' should definatly be allowed into a library because they are the hub of learning from magazines. However there are magazines that should not be allowed into a library like 'Playboy' and other pornographic magazines as well as ones like 'Cosmopolitan' which are magazines that target young girls to make them think that they should look perfect like the models in the pictures. Those are the types of magazines that make young girls dress skimpy and inapproprietly and make girls turn to throwing up to keep themselves skinny. There are definatly some things that should be kept out of the libraries but one book, or one movie, or one genre of music, or one kind of magazine should not keep them all out. One problem shouldnt make them all a problem. Libraries are a place where people go to escape, similar to things like realms of Minecraft and other videogames. People should have the right to go to a labrary with the intent of getting something and they should be able to get what they came for, thus ensuring that libraries remain a diverse and valuable resource for all.
1119	4096	2	3	@CAPS1 is what made this country the who we are today! There are many ways people can express them self in today's world, and it just so happens the art of writing acting and art are a huge part to the way people express them self, because all of us are different and have our different views on the subject. I'm not going to preach to you about what is right and what is wrong; I'm just going to share a few prior experiences. Now all of these were from being in libraries, some of them in smaller towns, others in the heart of a larger city. There is even a story of a man and wife, in the suburbs of a larger city. It is also amazing to see what is accepted in different parts of our country.  Well it all started when I was sitting at a small table in the back of the @LOCATION1 library. It was a small group of friends and we were all working on our research papers. But we then saw a man and a woman, what I perceived as husband and wife. They were looking at the magazines on the shelf directly in front of us. As he picked up a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine, she looked over to him and proclaimed, that is so derogatory against women. So he put it down and walked out. Wondering what was so bad about this magazine, I walked over to the rack to see a woman standing in her underwear with a classic car. About a month later I was walking in my local library dropping off some books for my mom. Instantly when opening the door I hear two people having a heated conversation about the painting they had hanging on the back wall, in the adult section, which was of a woman with her chest exposed; now mind you this was not a modern painting it was rather old, with the paint slowly peeling off. Now that painting was there for many years without anyone saying anything and that was the argument made by the head librarian. There were many people standing in the area that this was taking place, and many of them were not even willing to hear what the woman had to say, because the painting turned out to be very famous and has been there since before some of the middle aged people in there could remember.  As you can see there are many different views on what is accepted in the modern time. Advertisement is all over and many magazines use people's bodies to draw people to their add, so they can try to sell their product. I believe there should be a line drawn when it comes to that kind of advertising; they @MONTH1 have to come to a agreement that each magazine should say if it contains the kind of adult content like that. If they were to make this a law they should have to put it right in the front cover so you know if you pick that magazine up, you are at risk of seeing things like that. Although when it comes to a painting of times before the @DATE1 and people had grown up in that same area for years and have been seeing this painting since they were young too, I do not think that painting should have been taken off the wall. There is a fine line when it comes to the information being acceptable or not, that is why I do believe there should be some kind of rating system with the book and etc. In conclusion, finding the right balance between freedom of expression and community standards remains an ongoing process, requiring thoughtful consideration and open dialogue.
1120	4097	2	3	@PERSON1 is saying we shall all share then never giving @CAPS4 back. Also we can't all get what we want at the sametime or at all. If that book is popular then they should of bought more to sell for the other people that doesn't have the book and would like to have @CAPS4. Of course sharing is better then wasting your money on something when someone has the book that you know and would let you barrow @CAPS4. And yes, We all know that most people these days don't usually share. To tell you the truth you don't always get what you want. Either get over @CAPS4. Yea @PERSON2 has a @CAPS1 but to tell you the truth everybody has there own opinion. We all don't have to listen to what other's say but if you agree with that person then you agree. Like I said everybody has there own opinion and I stated mine.Pretty much like '@CAPS1 OF @CAPS2.' No, I do not believe that books,music, and etc. should be taken off the shelves because @CAPS3 @CAPS4's stupid you'll lose your job and @CAPS5 people out there in the world need something to do @CAPS6!? I don't read I mostly listen to music because I think music to me is more interesting and entertaning then reading a book. I mean yea I read articles from magazines but like I said mostly listen to music. Reading a book is mostly like someone telling you a story about so and so or somthing . So to me @CAPS7 book is in infront of @CAPS7 face @NUM1. '@CAPS7 life' @CAPS8 later on in @CAPS7 life I will be interested in reading a book but now I'm enjoying @CAPS7 life being a teenager. So basically I'm telling you @CAPS7 own opinion and I think @CAPS4's completely stupid for being graded for this because everybody has there own opinion just saying. You could either agree or disagree but for this @CAPS4's mostly a disagree, which is perfectly acceptable because in the end, we're all entitled to our own perspectives and beliefs.
1121	4098	2	3	I am writing this essay to persuade the members of our local library to use better censorship when putting unfit material on the shelves for the members of our community to use. In this essay I will reflect my views of this subject, backed by true facts that I have learned from many passed experiences. I believe that there is a large amount of reading material on the children section selves of our libraries that is far to advanced for many young children to understand. I myself have reviewed many of the books in the childrens section of many libraries. When doing so I noticed that many of the material makeing up this section is far to advanced or is to profound for children to absorb. Young children need to be reading more books of fantasy to allow them to use their imagiation more and not let their head be filled with thoughts of war and disaster. The children that read today need to have more material offered to them that they understand and not so much material that they can't comprehend. Lets use put more fit books on the selves of our library and quit wasteing our money on unfit books. In reaching the conclusion of this article I hope that I have persueaded the readers to understand the point I am trying to make, about the need for age-appropriate reading materials; I hope my readers take the information I have givin and put it to work.
1122	4099	2	3	Libraries are community centers. Children and adults go to libraries to check out new books that could give them new experiences and information. If libraries took out books because they were inappropriate or offensive, then young adults and adults would never receive those new experiences. Libraries require all sorts of books to make it a qualified library. If libraries censor their books, then other materials might start vanishing as well.  Most young adults read about books that are about adventure, mystery, or love. A person could find a mystery book with a serial killer for a main character offensive, but you can't rewrite the book for one person; furthermore, take that book completely off the shelf. That book is public property. If the library took that mystery book off the shelf, then the library is taking away the experience of another young adult reading it. One teenager's thoughts do not account for other teenagers' thoughts.  Libraries that take away offensive or inappropriate books might influence other multi-billion dollar industries to second guess their work. The movie industry, for example, might second guess the directors or actors/actresses they are hiring. Actors and actresses have a large influence on many teenagers and children. Imagine if a child's favorite actor disappeared from future movies; that child would be left without a role model. The affects of censoring books and magazines go way beyond the libraries, potentially impacting even the entertainment choices available.  Music artists might also be affected. Rappers curse and swear in their music because it is how they voice their opinions and personal experiences. For example, @ORGANIZATION1, a famous rapper, curses in his music because it's how he shows his emotion in an event. If music publishers wouldn't publish him because his work is offensive, then he would lose his job and career. This is how people in today's society make their living; by providing entertainment to other people.  Libraries have no right to take away any books from other children and adults. Authors know what they are writing. They write it because it shows emotions and feelings. It is the same thing with music artists and screen-play writers. If movies were all about unicorns the movie industry would fall apart quickly. Libraries, as a whole, need to think about the bigger picture before they extinguish books, experiences, thoughts, and hard work, and they should consider the far-reaching implications of limiting access to diverse materials.
1123	4100	2	3	Raded @CAPS1 for @CAPS2, violance and some nudety. This kind of movie shouldnt be on any kind of shelf. Its to inapprope for kids, see or even read what the movie case says. There shouldnt be any kind of movie or magazine with nude pictures. Its bad for the kids to see or here because one day a little boy/girl is going to do something that they see in a movie or a magazine and get in trouble. Its just wrong to see other people naked if u ask me. The only person i want to see that way is my wife in ten or so years. But i dont want to watch a movie and see a lady nude. The nest thing is violance. Man i just wish guns wernt invented or bombs. Because I have lost alot of friends to guns. I lost about six cousins in the war from where a bomb hit there area. More and more people and going out and buying guns and bombs because, of movies and what people say in books and in magazines. People are getting name of guns and what they look like from movies and magazines and getting them and getting bombs off the black market. People get these ideas because of movies. Last but not least @CAPS2 it the main thing kids get in trouble for in schools. They leard it from movies mainly because the actor say the words. Now the kids know how to say them. Statistics say that kids say and do what there favorite actor says and dose on and off the air. My conclusion says that all every thing with violance should be taken off the shelfs because, of the potential negative impact on children and society as a whole.
1124	4101	2	3	Throughout history there have been many books written at a time in history when their beliefs on certain things differed from what our world today believes. Things that have changed as our world has changed are the views on slavery, womens rights, religion, and many other things. These views are based on what most people of a time frame believed. I feel that just because something someone wrote or said offends someone, does not give people the right to ban that book or quote from society as a whole. They have the right to ban it from themselves, but it is up to each individual whether or not it is banned for everyone. Our government gives us the right to have freedom of speech. This shows that even though someone might write or speak out against the majority opinion, they can say whatever they want without being punished for it. This means that people can not just ban something for what it might say or portray. In my life explicit music seems to be something that some people are trying to ban. My parents believe that I am at the right age that I should be allowed to listen to whatever type of music I want to. I feel that public libraries can set age restrictions on items based off language, nudity, and other inappropriate things for children just as movie theaters do, but they do not have the right to ban books. Even though there is an age restriction, as long as the guardian of the child directly says it is fine if his/her child might check out the book or the parent checks out the book for the child, then it is fine that that child gets that book. The choice for what is appropriate for that each child should be left up to their parents. If libraries had to ban books because someone said that a certain book or magazine was offensive, then a library would have very few to no books. In almost all of books someone might be able to find something offensive to them or to someone else. These books that offend people should be kept on the shelf so that people can understand how society's views on things were back in the time period that the book was written. These items in libraries that are found offensive shows us what was wrong with society at that time and helps us learn from past mistakes in history and how to avoid them. For example, in the play A Doll's House it shows how the society's view of women was. It showed that they did not think highly of women and how there purpose in life were to raise the children and that was it. They did not feel that they had the intellect to talk about science or anything like that. This indirectly teaches us how we should not treat women today. If libraries start to ban books, music, movies, magazines or other items then they are hiding things they do not want people to read. Libraries should not be able to ban something because it is offensive, but they have the right to put age restrictions on certain things. Authors and artists have freedom of speech to say whatever they want and libraries can not take that away from them, therefore preserving the diversity of thought and historical understanding that these materials offer.
1125	4102	2	3	I believe that the children of today should be able to read, and learn the same things that our parents have learned in the past. Learning things through the same teachings, books, movies... etc. Learning things this way would be better than taking out cussing, swearing, and certain detailed writing, because if you took all that away it's like lying about history, and what really happened. Should the children of today be deprived of the truth? Would you want your children going to school every day and learning things from a textbook that was twisted around just so that it was appropriate and non-offensive? Think about it... Were you deprived of learning history when you were in school? I didn't think so, so why start now? Say your child is going to be reading 'To Kill a Mockingbird' in English class today. Would you want to ruin a classic book by taking the 'N' word and the word 'slave' out of the book? Depriving them of how there used to be slave owners, slaves, and racial comments? Depriving them of actual history? Would you also deprive them from learning about wars, revolutions, and mass killings just to make learning appropriate? No. I wouldn't. I would want my children learning anything and everything about world history, as sanitizing it would be a disservice to them and to the past. I do not think that there should be censorship in libraries, as withholding such knowledge would ultimately hinder their understanding of the world.
1126	4103	2	3	Some people argue that a library holds documents that are offensive and should not be put on the shelf, but I beg to differ. A library holds many books, magazines, movies, etc. that can advance the knowledge of citizens. Libraries can, and probably do, contain materials that are guilty of being offensive, but they shouldn't be taken off the shelf because of this. Instead, libraries should be divided into sections based on topics. If a parent doesn't want their child to read a book based on racism, then the parent simply keeps the child out of that section. How will children learn about what goes on in society if they are not shown? Children won't know how to cope with the harsh realities of the world unless they are exposed to them early. This doesn't mean that a child should be shown a magazine highlighting Lindsay Lohan's next drug scandal, but showing them that stuff like this does go on and you should not live that way. Libraries don't contain material that is offensive without a reason. What if a high school student is doing a report on the rise of teen-pregnancy? This student should have no better source for information than a library. The library would be the most trustworthy documentation of facts about this topic. These books that a library holds are not only there to educate us, but to entertain us as well. If a library removes a biography on the rapper, Eminem, because he has a 'rocky past', they will lose one client who came to the library to be amazed by the struggles that many successful people have overcome to get where they are today. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us.' If a library censors all of the material that goes throught the system, there will not be any books left to entertain ourselves. Therefore, libraries should not monitor what material is put on the shelf, allowing a wide range of perspectives and information to remain accessible.
1127	4104	2	3	There are thousands of books in libraries now a days, some are from @NUM1 years ago. Books are books, and anyone at any age should be able to remove any type of book off of a shelf. Books, music, movies and magazines are all mad to interest people and what they enjoy reading. Authors and publishers should not be pentalized for their hard work they achieved. There are many people in the world, who like all different types of books. But just because a book has censorship inside the story doesn't mean any human being will enjoy the story. I enjoy reading stories about romance, and I'm sure there is censorship inside a romance story. I only prefer romance stories, and if every single romance story had censorship and libraries removed the books from the shelves, I wouldn't read any type of book. Because I only enjoy reading about the romance. I only find adults and young adults reading romance stories, and these people have the matureness not to act out about censorship. It's not best to ruin the stories for adults and young adults who like to read about the censorship inside of stories. There many be people who find it so interesting, that if it's based on a true story then they would want to be willing to help the person out based on the situation. Don't take away the chance for these authors to succeed more in life. Let these young adults read about everything they are interested in, and banning books with censorship limits their access to diverse perspectives. I'm sure there are many different people who would be upset if the censored stories were eliminted from the shelves in libraries, as it restricts their freedom to explore different narratives.
1128	4105	2	3	Censorship, only for the light hearted. We have had this issue for as long as man can remember. Since we were only little kids to adults, everything was censored. Bleeps on the television to hide harmless words to random letters in curse words as if we did not know for example what @NUM1k spelt. I agree, censorship is needed for a certain period of time, but when that time goes on for too long and even in books and newspapers to limit what we can handle, that's when it goes out of hand.  I am a highschool student and even I have to say limiting our reading because a book might have one or two bad words in it is just rediculous. It's the most hipocritical thing to do because even science and anatomy books show certain parts of the body like genitalia but that's okay because it's in a science book. However if it's in a normal book, everythings a big deal and we can't handle it big woop. I say it's a library, let us read what we want to read, broadening our minds and perspectives.  Like I said before highschool is where the maturity hits and the censorship should be lowered. Im not saying just completly take it away but come on now I think highschool student can handle a few bad words in an outstanding book. We are old enough to think for ourselves and make our own decisions about what we consume.  As far a movies and music go, anything pornographic or just plain idiotic and demeaning should ofcourse be censored, but if theres just a few bad words why should that stop an entire school from enjoying some good music and possibly an amazing movie. The artistic value and overall message should be considered, not just the presence of some language deemed inappropriate by some.  So the point is, let there be censorship, but only to the point where people wont just take away music and books from us highschoolers for a few bad words. Censorship is for the lighthearted, and nothing is stopping the lighthearted people from not picking up that book with a few words in it they don't like, just dont read it. Thats all I have to say about censorship, it should be a personal choice, not a blanket restriction.
1129	4106	2	3	Read, listen, and watch? Books, music, and movies all have a meaning and a purpose to them. In our spare time, we all enjoy to read, listen, and watch the things that let us do so. These things keeps us all occupied when theres alot of time to spare. The library is a place where you can go read in peace and listen to music with no distractions or anything, but there are somethings that are not cut out for the library.  People find books at the library that they find very interesting and decides to check them out, but little do they know what the book and/or magazine has in it. Books come in all different genres and so do music and movies. And we all have our own views in what type of genre we enjoy listening, reading or watching.  Genre comes in all kind of different types. For example, theres only one certain type of book for a child and which at the library should be picked out for a child to read and a child only. Theres also books for grown adults and adults only and once checked out, it should be kept from a childs hand or vision. Because children could see the wrong things and things might get out of hand.  All readings, music, or movies that have explicit or uncensored graphics or words should personally have their own section in the library. In this case, nothing bad could happen and everything is in place with everything else. Honestly all media actually should have their own section. For example, all kids media should be in one section and all adult media should be in another section.  All books should be left on the shelves of every library, only because one knows what should be read and what shouldn't be read. A kids desired book is a childrens book with color and picture while on the other hand, an adult has their own type of selection. So books should stay where they belong and not tooken down from any self, that also goes for, movies, music, or any other media. Therefore, by carefully organizing and categorizing library materials, we can ensure a safe and enriching experience for everyone.
1130	4107	2	3	Libraries already face challenges like unreturned items. They shouldn't have to remove books, music, movies, or magazines simply because some individuals deem them offensive. Why discuss something that offends only one person, when no one else has complained? I don't understand how a book can be offensive. If someone finds something offensive, they don't have to borrow it. Others might read it to learn from different perspectives. If you dislike a library, you can go to another. There's no need to be offended by books, as authors are merely expressing their viewpoints.  There are two options: accept it and use the library, or avoid the library to avoid potential offense. However, offense can be found anywhere, so one might as well accept it. You might ask why not remove offensive materials if it's not a big deal. The answer is that while you might not want to read them, others might. It's unfair to remove something just because a few people find it offensive.  Therefore, we should not remove books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else from libraries. People will have to tolerate what they dislike, as they are not forced to read anything offensive. We will not get rid of the books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else that we the library has because everything that is in the library is staying in the library, which is why maintaining diverse collections is essential.
1131	4108	2	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 As I was growing up in my small little neighborhood, life could not have been more simple. For children, life is eating, sleeping, playing, and laughing. Their innocent minds do not ponder the meanings of life or of love, but curiosity does grab every child now and then. With a stubborn persistance, a child would probably go to the ends of the earth to understand what confidential information they overheard their parents talking about. But @CAPS1 does harmless curiosity mean the destruction of a child's innocence? By viewing adult-oriented material, such as books at a library, children can gain premature knowledge that can be harmful to their development. However, libraries should not fear stocking their shelves with books that are appropriate for adults because an author spend countless hours writing that book, that book represents a portion of history for the human race, and not everyone @MONTH1 find the contents inappropriate. Authors have the freedom to write about whatever interests them, and taking away their right to display their thoughts and opinions is unjust. A censored author must feel like a basketball player that did not make the cut despite hours of practice. Thus, an author that has practiced and perfected his writing skill does so in hopes of publishing his work. Not agreeing with someone's interest in a subject is no reason to exclude his valuable thoughts from society. Books that are appropriate for adults deserve to be displayed for adults as the author intended. Every piece of literature that has ever been written documents a portion of history of the human race. Even fictional novels serve as monuments to the depths of man's imagination. Therefore, no book should be censored, no matter how inappropriate the material is. Just as remembering the @CAPS2 has influenced mankind not to repeat past mistakes, keeping books of the most horrible content @MONTH1 save authors from repeating such dishonorable content. In other words, if censorship removes the 'mistakes' of literature from library shelves, who is to say that an oblivious author will not repeat that 'mistake'. By remembering these mistakes, mankind will be able to move forward in literature. @CAPS1 books are not 'mistakes', they serve as reminders of the high-points in literature. All literature, appropriate and inappropriate, is a piece of mankind's history that should not be kept a secret. Finally, who is to judge what is a 'mistake' in literature? A book on @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be inappropriate in the eyes of a @CAPS4, but that book @MONTH1 be sacred to a @CAPS5. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Furthermore, for any given book there is at least one person who disagrees with its message. A library is built for the education of the public, not for the interests of one person. If one is offended by a literary work, perhaps he should just move on and find a book more suited to his interests. The decision on the appropriateness of a novel is up to the reader, not the government or library or activist group. Censorship of material in libraries would strip authors of their chance to let their works be seen by others, keep records of the human race secret, and take away the privelage of the reader to decide what is appropriate. Authors endure long hours of practice and writing in order to have their thoughts read, and such a motive should not be taken away from them. Every book represents some aspect of human life and records it for future generations to avoid previous mistakes. And these 'mistakes' are decided by the reader, a decision that censorship takes upon itself. Instead of choosing what books are seen by the public, perhaps libraries should just create an adult-only section to house the 'controversial' books; as a result, mankind would stay educated and free, and children would remain innocent. -@ORGANIZATION2
1132	4109	2	3	There are many different perspectives on censorship in our country. This is the human race, opinionative that is. Different perspectives come from different people: young, old, parents, and children. In libraries there are some reading materials, that some parents find offensive.  Offensive material in libraries is not always directed to be read by young children. They are also not always intended to be able to get there hands on such material. Even though this is not always the purpose of that material, it happens that this material ends up in the hands of someone who shouldn't have it. No the material is not always held under lock and key, but it is also not always left to lay at a child high shelf that would seem appealing to them.  The problem with removing all of this material from libraries would result in empty shelfs, except for the children's books. The material that would have to be removed are books meant for people of the appropriate age group to inform and tell good stories. If we protected children from censorship this would deny knowledge, and also a get away for some, from the general public that anually go to the library.  Not all movies, books, music, and other materials are labeled as they should be. Some material may not be appropriate for children, but they also are not all inappropriate. A rated 'PG-13' movie may be just like a rated 'PG' movie only with one extra reference, that may be taken in the wrong way. Even protective parents may allow their children to view movies like this as long as they find it appropriate.  Libraries should not remove this material from their shelves. If it is that much of an issue, then they could have the children books in a seperate room of the library. There are many possibilities of keeping this kind of reading material away from children. All of which do not have the need of removing these books and other materials from the libraries' shelves.  Censorship in libraries is a contraversial subject. There is a very good arguement on either side of whether or not to take offensive material off of shelves in the libraries. I believe it should not be taken off and there are alternatives to this. This essay proposed solutions to this problem without taking the public reading right away from everyone, showing that there are ways to protect children without completely restricting access for everyone else.
1133	4110	2	3	@STATE1 Virginia, @NUM1 23456, @PERSON1 John Smith, IN @CAPS1 Chesapeake Katherine Paterson, I read your article in the newspaper yesterday about offensive books in the library. I agree with you on this article. Some of the books, music, movies, or magazines in public libraries are very offensive to me but they can be normal to other people. There can also be some books that are normal to me and can be offensive to other people. Everyone has their own views and ideas on everything. The people of @LOCATION1 Virginia have freedom of speech so it is true that every mouth has got something different to say. There are some books or movies that children cannot read or watch, but children still do because once the child is in the library, he can read, watch, or listen to anything. You cannot depend on the librarian because there are other people in the library, too. The librarian probably has other things to do like arranging the books or checking out the books or making library cards or helping someone find a book. In my point of view, the library should have different sections for different kinds of movies, books, or magazines and there should be a person assigned for every section. This way children would not be able to go to older people's section. If there are books that are found offensive by everyone, then people should write a letter to the president to help remove those books from the library. Yours @NUM2 truly.
1134	4111	2	3	"Have you ever been in that situation where you couldn't read a book because of someone else having bitter feelings towards it? Are you furious when you finally get a chance to read that book you've been waiting on for two months and all of a sudden it's not available to you because of its content? I know I always am because at @ORGANIZATION1 this happens quite often. I believe that a book shouldn't be removed because only one person found it to be offensive. Sure some novels @MONTH1 expose a few words of profanity or discrimination but everyone has to deal with it. So why take one book off the shelf for saying something vulgar because not everyone might dislike the book? If we took a book off the shelf every time someone reported a bad word or a discriminative remark then we would be left with no books, including the ones that tell us a great deal about past history.  Some authors, movie directors, and artists rely on history to help them create a great piece of reading, commentary, or lyrics. If the libraries in the public and in schools censored everything there could be a @ORGANIZATION1 risk of losing a lot of historic and epic material or information from the past. As I'm sure you know, a lot of history books about the Holocaust, slavery, and the civil rights movement include words that people of certain genders or races @MONTH1 find offensive. These words are a vital source in the attempt to explain what the people in those situations are going through; therefore, those words shouldn't be reported for history's sake.  I know I'm not alone in my fight to keep books on the shelf because an author named Katherine Paterson says, ""... If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf—that work I abhor—then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us"" (Paterson). In this quote, she is trying to say if people abuse this policy there will be no books left on the shelf for anyone to read because someone found something offensive to them. This is what will eventually happen if we don't censor the @CAPS1 in the libraries.  Now don't mistake me for someone who believes that @CAPS1 should be dropped altogether because I believe it is needed in some cases. If there is a song that uses profanity multiple times without any logical reasoning then it shouldn't be available to the public through a library. Also, if there are inappropriate movies I don't think that they should be distributed by the library to the public because that's what movie rental stores are for. On the other hand, I haven't found a single book that isn't suitable for the library; so why are there so many books being taken away every year due to what some people call '@CAPS1,' also known as self opinions?  In this writing my goal was accomplished; I wanted to let everyone know that the whole @CAPS1 thing is getting a little out of hand. We all know that there are some offensive things that @MONTH1 be happening but they are things that everyone who views that book, movie, or soundtrack has to deal with. With some offensive things comes a reasoning like in history books and movies that @MONTH1 contain a few bad words but are used to get a point or setting across. I know that @CAPS1 is just another way of looking out for the better of humans but a lot of it has a reason. The only case where @CAPS1 should be used is in inappropriate movies and songs with no historic purpose. With all that has been said, do you still believe in all of the @CAPS1 going on in your nearby library? How can you help prevent the destruction of all of the historic words in libraries? It is time to re-evaluate the way we approach censorship and ensure that libraries remain a place of diverse and uncensored knowledge."
1135	4112	2	3	I think that it should be left alone the way it is because it was put that way for a reason. People might not know the reason, so that's why I think it should stay, because the person who put it there might get mad if you mess it up just because you don't like it the way it is, especially if it is offensive to some people. Other reasons are because people are going to stay home and watch it online or on TV anyway, so how is changing it going to make a difference? It is not going to make one difference at all, as viewership will likely remain constant regardless of any alterations.
1136	4113	2	3	No, I believe all materials should be on the shelfs at libraries. Because some people like stuff other people find offensive. But you as parents should control what your kids are reading. If you find it offensive tell them to pick out a new book, new CD, a new movie, or a new magazine. If you don't its not their fault it's your fault. Some people like stuff that others don't. Such as, stuff from anther culture or maybe something from a different religion. But we can choose to read whatever we want to. If you don't like it find something else but, some people find it interesting. Not everyone has the same veiws on stuff. If there are books just for adults put it in anther room to were miniors can't get in. Make it to were you have to show an ID that says you are 18 or older to get in. Than you can look at inapporiate books without haveing to risk kids seeing them. Than in order to check them out if you're under the age of 18 a parent or gaurdian has to be with you if you want to get it. If it's a CD or musican that has cussing in it you need to be 18 or older or have a parent check that out for you. Because some parents don't let their kids listen to bad music. Like I said in pervious paragraphs I believe that they should't take stuff off the shelfs that a few or some people find inapproite. Because a few of us might find it interesting to know that this world isn't all the same. People are different like different things, therefore, libraries should not censor materials based on individual objections.
1137	4114	2	3	Everyone in the world has different opinions. Some people care about things that other people don't care about at all. One topic that seems to get everyone going is censorship. Everyone has an opinion on it; and not everyone agrees with each other. All libraries have different sections based upon age. There are childrens sections, teens sections, and adult sections. I think censorship has a lot to do with maturity levels. Things in books and movies that aren't appropriate for children, shouldn't be put in the children section. I understand parents' don't want their children reading or watching obscene material; but as kids are growing up, they're going to learn about the inappropriate things sooner or later in school.  I don't think anything should be taken off of a shelf just because a handful of parents find the material offensive. I don't take censorship very seriously. Some parents want their children reading books with inappropriate material so they can learn about what goes on in the world and what life is like. Most children and some teens don't know what the world is like because they don't get out much. They don't learn things that they should know already. Reading is a way of learning. When someone wants to know more information about any place or anything, they go to the library and check out a book. For a school project or just for fun.  Most parents agree that nothing inappropriate should be in a childrens' section at a library. Just because they're young and parents don't want their kids going around at the age of eight cussing like a sailor. But I think that teens are mature enough to read or watch inappropriate material like a book with cussing or a movie with kissing scenes. Parents shouldn't have a say on what goes on or off the shelves in a library. They should just mind their own business. If their kid picks out a book that they think is too offensive for them to read, then they can just simply tell them that they cannot get the book. It's as simple as that. Parents who ask for books to get taken off the shelf are just asking for too much.  Censorship in libraries is not a big deal to me. I think kids should be able to read a book that they want to read. At least they're wanting to read. Let them read for goodness' sake. But like I said, everyone has their own opinions, and while I respect other perspectives, I believe limiting access to books hinders learning and personal growth.
1138	4115	2	3	"I am writing this essay to tell you that offensive books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be on our library shelves. Because if our kids pick them up, there will be conflict and crime. Some people might ask how I know this; well, say you see this CD case that says ""black men only CD,"" and a white boy picks it up. Well, then a black kid sees it in that white boy's hand, the black guy will try to rip it out of his hand, therefore starting a fight. This kind of scenario illustrates how easily offensive materials can incite negative interactions and potentially lead to more serious consequences. It is important to protect our children from such influences, ultimately ensuring a safer and more harmonious environment for everyone."
1139	4116	2	3	What should and shouldn't be censored in a library really is just a matter of opinion from the people using the library. If everyone were to remove what they didn't like from the shelves of a library then much information would be less accessible to the general public. Although some people might be offended by some forms of literature, this doesn't mean that the literature should be removed from everyone. I believe a solution must be made to satisfy everyone.  Currently, some people aren't happy with some of the books, music, movies, and magazines that are available at many libraries. They believe that the information might be unsuitable for some viewers. Some people just do not want certain information getting in the minds of children.  While that is a very solid reason to censor what goes into our libraries; there are others who disagree with the thought of censoring our libraries. By allowing the censoring of libraries it would decrease the amount of information available to the public. If parents allow their children to take out certain materials without first checking what's behind the cover, then the parents have no one to blame but themselves.  I believe that this could all be resolved by simply having parents fill out a form before allowing their children to get a library card. This form would include a list of things that they would want to prevent their kids from checking out such as: swearing in books and music, nudity in movies and magazines. This information would be put with the serial number of the library card. If their child were to checkout something that is restricted on the list, the librarian would tell them to put the book back and pick another book.  I can see how censorship is very useful and important, although sometimes it can be taken a bit to the extreme. Therefore, striking a balance through parental involvement and clear guidelines can help protect children while also upholding the principles of intellectual freedom and access to information, ensuring a more inclusive library environment for everyone.
1140	4117	2	3	In the library I have noticed that there are a few literature materials that are not suitable for a younger age group. Such as rated @CAPS1 movies that contain things like drug use, sexual content, and extreme violence. Not all libraries have movies, and the ones that do don't let anyone under the age of @NUM1 rent out a rated @CAPS1 movie. Another example would be magazines that have articles/advertisments and pictures that are more towards the sexual side. This is a problem with children because then they think that that's how they should look and act, when they are older. Most libraries are divided up into different sections, there is a section for adults, teens, and children. The sections were created for a reason to show/tell people that some materials in this section @MONTH1 not be suitable for teens and children. Then if your in a childrens section you know that not many over the age of @NUM2 will be wanting to look around for books. In the childrens section a library normally makes it look bright and colorful which most children love. This helps the children stay there and not wonder off into one of the adult or teen sections. When I was younger I didn't really care to go into the adult or teen sections cause I enjoyed reading 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4', '@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8', and many other children books there. Children have a lot of things to satisfy them at the library there's children movies/shows like '@CAPS9 @PERSON1'. They also have an unlimited amout of books that can keep them entertained. If movies and books don't work for them then there are also a few toys they can play with (at least the libraries I've been to have toys). The only real big problem with having things unapropriate in the library is that the younger teens might wander into the adult section, and sometimes there are adult things in the young adult section. Again with the movies, there are tv shows that I've seen at the library that are about teens doing drugs going to parties and getting drunk. Things like that I think put a bad influence on younger teens, making them think it's okay to do drugs and drink, that it will make them more popular and cool. Libraries could also implement stricter policies regarding the placement of potentially sensitive materials in the young adult section to ensure that younger teens are not exposed to content that is not age-appropriate. Over all I think that libraries just need to reorganize there books, movies, and magazines. Then all the right items will be put in the right sections and there will be no accidents where someone accidently picks up something that is inapropitate for their age group. The music in the library I don't think is much of a problem. To me music is something more to express your feelings. This is my view on censorship in libraries, focusing on ensuring age-appropriate materials are readily accessible and that potentially harmful content is appropriately managed to protect younger library patrons.
1141	4118	2	3	There are many books out there that, if looked into, have something obscene or vulgar in it. Despite the fact that children of certain ages probably shouldn't be reading these types of things, the book itself should not be banned from the shelves of libraries. Authors write or type every word for a reason, whether happy or sad or vulgar. There is a reason the author wants the reader to read these 'offensive' things. Everything you read in a book is there because the author wanted you to read it, not to just put it there to fill in or to be nasty. I agree that children shouldn't read these books with that kind of material in them but that doesn't mean take the books down. The library where I live has sections for children, teens, and adults so that there is no confusion or concern of the content of the book. You have to be of age in order to take some of the readings home. I personally think that this is a great idea and will compromise both sides that don't want their kids reading these books and those who want to read the book without getting rid of anything. If the latter was taken in to effect though, some of the classic and prize winning books would be taken off the shelves, such as To Kill a Mockingbird, The Catcher, Brave New World's Handmaid's Tale, and much more. Such harsh actions aren't necessary when a much simpler and more effective way can be accomplished. Although offensive material is a concern for children there are much better ways to have it so they can't read them until ready. No book should be taken off a shelf for its content, as there are better, less restrictive solutions to protect children while still preserving access to literature for those who are ready for it.
1142	4119	2	3	I feel that books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves just because someone finds them offensive. They only become offensive when people think they are. I feel this way because no one is forcing anyone to watch or read anything they don't want to. No one is telling students what they can and can't watch or read; everyone has the choice to choose what they want to read or watch. What one person may find offensive and wrong, another person may find interesting and exciting. I have felt the same way before, but that still gives me no reason to take it off the shelf. The next person after me has just as much right as I did. The person has the right to watch or read what I have, to like or hate whatever is on the shelves. There are lots of things in a LIBRARY other than things that people find offensive. There are scary books like 'IT', by best selling author, Stephen King. There are mystery books like 'The Da Vinci Code', by another best selling author, Dan Brown. So to sum up my essay, nothing should be taken off LIBRARY shelves just because I or anyone else finds them offensive, as access to diverse materials and perspectives should be upheld.
1143	4120	2	3	I believe that there are many books in a library that should not be available to everybody that goes into a public library. Yes, there are some very offensive items in a library, such as a book about racism towards African Americans. No, that person who takes offense at those items does not have to be around them or even go into the library at all. The library is open to any and or everybody. Lets suppose you have a young child, and you take him/her to the public library with you. As you are looking for a book, the child reaches for the highest book that he/she can reach, pulls it off the shelf, and it lands on the floor open. You look down to see what had happened, and you see the book lying there with an inappropriate picture right in front of your child. That is your own fault, not the library's. Although many times it is not the library's fault where certain books are, you should be more responsible and check out the area in which you are looking. I think there should be a select area for which the 'inappropriate material' should be kept. And for a person to get into the select area, they must show a membership type of identification and sign a waiver saying the material they have checked out will cause no trouble nor take offense to anybody in which the customer is around. This system would provide access while acknowledging parental responsibility and community standards, ultimately addressing the concerns raised. And that is my view on this subject.
1144	4121	2	3	Books being taken off the shelves? No way! The library is the place to go if you want books, movies, music, etc., that fit what you like and want. Should some material be taken off the shelves all because of it offending someone else? No, because Libraries are ment for everyone for a reason. Everybody is diffrent. Which means everyone comes to the library for diffrent types of information. If the libraries took off all material that offended people there would be nothing left. What offends someone may not offend someone else. For example, the libraries have information on the World War II history. While some people like that kind of information and want to continue learing about it, the information is also offending Japanese Americans who it talks about. But really if you think about it, its all selfish to take away material someone else wants to learn about. It would be keeping the next generations to come from learning everything they possibly could or wanted to. When people go to the library they know, no matter what information their looking for, they will find it. Isn't that whats so great about trips to the library? Looking and finding things you never learned about, even if it offends others. All that matters is that your head is holding more knowlege about that certain subject. It will never be okay to take certain material off the shelves that offends other people because libraries are ment for everyone for a reason, fostering intellectual exploration without censorship.
1145	4122	2	3	I do not think that certain materials should be removed for many reasons. Many different people have many different thoughts on what's offensive and what isn't; like some people will find something funny that some people think is nasty or inappropriate. If you were to take things off the shelves that someone found offensive there probably wouldn't be much left on the shelves because everybody has their own opinion. I agree that certain things shouldn't be seen by young eyes but that's the parents' decision, not everyone has the same view on the material. Certain materials should not be removed from shelves because of one person's opinion on it, especially considering the subjective nature of offense. Everyone has their own opinion, some people like what other people don't; everyone is different in their own way, so censorship based on individual sensitivities would be impractical and unfair.
1146	4123	2	3	I firmly believe that the removing of books, music, movies, ect., from a shelf just because someone finds it offensive will not solve the problem. A person can find many things in life offensive to their personal views, but they can not just remove them. To remove books, music, movies, ect., from people who do not find them offensive could provoke chaos. As Katherine Paterson stated 'And then we have no books left.' If everyone were to choose books, music, movies, ect., they felt were offensive and should not be placed in the library the statement would probably be true. Besides the point the library is sectioned off into different genres, so if you have a different view of a certain genre of books, movies, music, etc., skip over that section and go to the genre in which you prefer. In other words, the things that may offend one person may not offend another person. So to remove one particular thing would be unreasonable for the person who likes or finds interest in a particular subject. So instead of there being a problem with one person there would a problem with two unsatisfied people. Not saying that it is right, but the library has done particular things such as, separating the books for reasons like this. According to Katherine Paterson, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' The library has a section for children only. Therefore worries of problem like this have already been solved. The books, music, movies, ect., in the childrens section is age apprioate for a child. Books, music, movies, ect., are also sectioned off for teenagers and adults.  Moreover, the library's collection serves a diverse community, and removing items based on subjective offense would limit access to various perspectives and artistic expressions. This censorship could hinder intellectual growth and open dialogue.  In conclusion, the removal of books, music, movies, ect., that are found offensive by others may not be found offensive by someone else. It is not like the library would purposely offend anyone by having the books, music, movies, ect., on the shelfs. If you are mature enough to understand that and over look something that may offend you, you would not be so offended. Also if the library is sectioned off into different genre, you can easly by pass a particular genre you wish to avoid. Problems can be easily solved if they are dealt with in the correct manner, maintaining a balance between individual sensitivities and the broader principles of intellectual freedom.
1147	4124	2	3	I don't think so because what if that is all the person likes to read? They could put all the books into different sections so that little kids won't be learning words they shouldn't know right now. The librarian could also make it where you have to be a certain age to check out a book. There are a bunch of ways to organize them into sections, like make a kids section, a teenager section, and even an adult section. But I don't think they should take them out of the library for good, because there are a lot of good books with some bad words in them; just because there are some bad words in a book does not mean the book is bad, especially since these books can offer valuable insights and perspectives despite containing some offensive language.
1148	4125	2	3	Keep it on the Shelf! What types of things do you go to the library for? Some go for books and others go just to relax in a quiet environment. Yes, the library is mostly used for books and studying, but there are many other things that libraries contain. Movies, magazines, music, etc., are all found in a library. Now, say you had to listen to a specific song, read a certain book, or review an article in a certain magazine, and you can't find it at the library because they have been removed because they are found to be offensive. All people have different views on what is and isn't offensive. Everything like books, music, magazines, and movies should all have their place in a library, regardless of the material.  Books can be used for many things. Some read just for the enjoyment and others read because it is assigned to them or they need to research some things. Books give information and knowledge that some people need desperately. What if you can't find that book because someone said that its material is inappropriate? What are you supposed to do about your research paper now? If a book is needed it should be able to be found on the shelf in a library and not be taken out because of the content of its pages.  Music is a great way to clear your mind and relax. Some music found in libraries can be somewhat offensive to some people. What if the only place you can find your favorite music is at your public library? You walk in and they no longer have it because it is considered to be offensive. Now you can no longer listen to the sounds that calm you down or motivate you to get your day started. Music should remain in libraries because of the cultural and educational sounds that most cannot find at their local music store. Moreover, libraries offer access to genres and artists that might not be commercially viable, enriching the community's musical landscape.  Magazines are another great form of reading material found in a library. Magazines are a great way to stay up to date with the latest fashions and great dessert recipes. Without magazines our world wouldn't be able to keep up with the things that advance in our world everyday. Magazines show us the hottest trends, the gossip in the celebrity world, and some great facts from educational magazines. Without the magazines in the library we probably wouldn't know anything about our advancing world.  You can find movies anywhere, but some believe that you can only find the really good and old movies at the library. The library has educational movies for children that might not be available anywhere else. They also have old classic movies that aren't even around anymore. The library has many movies that you wouldn't be able to find in our advanced world today. Libraries preserve cinematic history, offering a glimpse into the past and different cultural perspectives.  Libraries hold a lot of important books, movies, music, and magazines. Without most of that, regardless of the material, we probably wouldn't know as much as we know today. The library has always been a place where you go to find exactly what you want and you know that they will have it. Removing these things from the shelves can be taking some history right out of our lives, hindering access to diverse perspectives and potentially limiting intellectual growth. All of these resources should stay on the shelves regardless of their material, ensuring that libraries remain vital hubs of knowledge and cultural preservation for everyone.
1149	4126	2	3	Can literature, which is the basis of civilization, be censored? Can you take these ideas away from those who wish to think them? I think not, for it would be a futile endeavor to even attempt. To keep something as important as written word away from the culture of the people, would be one of the highest crimes against humanity and could not rightly be condoned, in my mind. Not only would this attempt be futile (for the people know ways to extract information) it would be downright idiotic of the 'administration' to do so. I will concede that there are explicit materials out there that are not suitable for children or even adolescents, but that is where the parent should step in by setting guidelines and positive examples which their children feel the need to follow. Not feel that they 'have' to, but feel that they 'need' to. If parents cannot take control and decide what is appropriate for their children, then in my mind, they are not doing their first and foremost job as a parent that is to protect the child. Some may say that the censorship of culture is protecting the children, but I say that this is not so. I believe censorship is a lousy excuse so that parents and upper government officials have to do less work. If every piece of written, filmed, or recorded work, that was offensive only one person, was thrown out on that basis, there would be none. There has never been a piece of literature, film, or music that has not offended someone in some way, whether it be spiritually, ethnically, or morally. The fact is that people cannot exist without strife and misery, and whatever people can do to cause that strife and misery, they will. People find all sorts of ways to do it, whether it be war, discrimination, media, or just downright obstinance, they will find a way to offend their selected party. I personally am appalled at the aspect of censorship, for if a person cannot speak his mind, then is he more than a mindless homunculi? Created and controlled by the government surrounding him, and made their slave through ignorance. If in a society I cannot say what I need to say then I do not wish to live in that society, for it is nothing but a horrible image of civilization. In short I do not believe that libraries should be censored, rather that parents should pay more attention to their children and dependents. If a person is offended by a certain thing, then it is their absolute right to not take part in whatever it may be, but these afflicted peoples have absolutely NO right to say what I may or may not read! If this offends anyone, then I apologize, but at least you knew enough (through your education by media) to be offended and not just another mindless sheep, and I hope this sentiment resonates and encourages a more open and judicious approach to the consumption and interpretation of diverse materials.
1150	4127	2	3	Do you think that some materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be taken off of shelves if they are found offensive to people? This is a question that all of us have thought about at one point or another. For some, it just depends on your age, your beliefs, and if you actually know if it is offensive in the first place. In my opinion, I think that the offensive materials should be taken off the shelves. First of all, I think a lot of it depends on your age. For, example, most older people think that most of the material made today is just crazy and do not want anyhting to do with them. Although, for the younger people, thet is what is new and 'cool' to do. I do not believe that anything bad or offensive should be shown to any little kids. We want to keep it away from them so that in the future, they know not to use it. In my own experience, my parents kept me away from all of the bad stuff for the most part. I think it has affected me a lot today on who I am today. It is important to protect children from exposure to harmful content that could negatively influence their development. Next, I think for some people, it depends on their beleifs. A big thing with this is race and culture. I often find books, movies, or magazines offending another race. This the the thing that I find most disturbing about some materials. Anything offending another race or culture should be taken off the shelves immediately in my opinion. There are countless numbers of these materials just theat I have seen and I am sure that there are many more. It @MONTH1 be impossible to ever get every single one of these off the shelves. Promoting respect and understanding between different groups is essential for a harmonious society. Lastly, I think that a lot of people do not know that what they are going to read, watch, or listen to, is going to end up being offensive. I have seen a countless number of movies and listen to a countless number of songs that were offensive. The sad thing is, I did not know it before I did it. A lot of people just go into their material as blind as a bat, as far as knowing if it is offensive goes. I think that if the material is not taken off of the shelves, then it should at least be marked as offensive. This way, individuals can make informed decisions about the content they consume. All in all, I think that the material should just simply be taken off of the shelves. We have gotten to the point where there is so much out there that it is nearly impossible to do. Even though there are factors like age, beliefs, and knowing what you are going into, I think these materials are just bad for everyone. In my opinion, offensive materials should be taken off of the shelves, despite the challenges involved, because of the potential harm they can inflict on individuals and society as a whole.
1151	4128	2	3	Have you ever come across offensive material inside a library? Well some people have and they think there should be some type of censorship in libraries to protect the offended people. I do not agree with this idea because people should have the right to express themselves through art, literature, and even music. After all, the freedom of speech is written in our rights.  Many authors, artists, and musicians have the freedom to express themselves through their work. If they saw their own work in a library being censored it would be very offensive to them. I understand that the artist's material could be offensive to certain people but it is their work, a form of self-expression. They do not publish their work to offend people; they do it for themselves and for other people to enjoy it. An artist's work is a part of who they are, and censorship would just put a negative aspect on the art and literature of the library.  Over many years most libraries have developed and arranged their media into a system called the Dewey Decimal System and the Library of Congress Classification. This system separates all books, magazines, music, and movies into their own genres. For instance, if you are looking for a mystery book, you would find it in the fiction section. This system helps people find exactly what they are looking for. If people are offended by a certain genre they do not have to come in contact with it. This system is a better way to find exactly what you want instead of coming across a book or movie that you would find offensive. Almost every library uses this system so they do not have to use a censor.  Everywhere we go someone somewhere is going to find something offensive. It is basically part of our human nature. It is truly impossible to make every single person happy with everything in the world. In a library there will always be a book that someone disagrees with or someone will find it offensive. The author of that book and other people who enjoyed it do not need to be punished by having the book taken off the shelves. Just because the book offends one person does not mean it has to be taken off the shelf or have a censor. If every time that happened there would be no books left to read in our libraries. Most people would not even call that a library.  In the end, a book is a book, music is music and we are not going to create censors or take books off the shelves because it is offensive to people. Authors write what they want to write, musicians play what they want to play, and actors act how they want to act. After everything it does not matter what is offensive to people, they will just have to deal with it. There is no reason for a censor in a library, and we must protect the freedom of expression that libraries represent.
1152	4129	2	3	'Everyone has OPINIONS PREFERENCES.' It is true that everyone has their own PREFERENCES and their likes and dislikes. For example, books. I do not like books that are about illegal substances, but I do believe removing certain materials that are offensive should not be removed from the shelves in the library. It is true that finding inappropriate book or an article MAY be disturbing to certain people, but it does not mean that everyone finds it offensive. Once, my ENGLISH class was assigned to do a book project. The main pourpose was to find a non-fiction book and create a powerpoint presentation on the main ideas of that book. One of the classmate read and had a breif presentaion over a book that was about illegal drugs. I know in fact that not many people are offended by the words such as 'drugs' or 'alchol', but I find these words to be obnoxious. While I found it disturbing and uncomfortable, others found it interesting. It was a topic that drew their attention, but not very appealing to me. Another example would be the time I went to the library to write a research paper about the human body systems. My friend, AT THE LIBRARY, found it disturbing to look at some pictures because it showed blood. Strangly, I never thought blood as anything disturbing. While PERSON1 found it disgusting to look at, my head was in the book because it was fascinating. I always thought how the human body works is incredible. What PERSON1 did was instead of trying to deal with the picture, she wondered off and tried to find another book that does not have any grotesque pictures. The book did not have any benefit to HER, but because of that book, I received an 'A' on the research paper. I believe it is important that people accept the fact that everyone does not have the same opinion. Every individual is different in their own way. As I mentioned before, the book that was disturbing to me was interesting to others and vice versa. That is normal and there is nothing we can do to change about it. If permission were given to remove any certain materials that is offensive to each and every person, I guarentee that there would not be any material left on the shelves, so I think the best way to solve this problem is for he/she to ignore the book that seems to be offensive and look for different material because others might need the resource.
1153	4130	2	3	I believe that if something or someone offends you, you have the right to take a stand. You shouldn't have to deal with it. If something is offensive in your library, it has no right to be there. A library is supposed to be a helpful place. Who would want to sit back and watch a racist movie? Who would want to have a little kid watching something sexual in a movie? Magazines can even develop a lot of problems. Music can be straight offensive. If a young adult or a child reads or watches a movie that is racist, it teaches them bad things. Racism is a very hurtful thing. What you see or read can really have an effect on you. You might not realize that it is wrong. It could have you saying hurtful things to a different race. If a person isn't racist and they see something that is, it could offend them. They might feel like they're 'cool'. They go out and say racist things. It makes them feel good. Later on they feel guilty. All because of a movie or book. If a movie is making fun of your race, it hurts. Being made fun of hurts. It is technically bullying. Bullying can lead to suicide. Who cares if someone is black or white? We are all the same deep down inside. Movies like this should be banned from public libraries. Movies today can have pretty much anything they want in them. Sex, drugs, cursing, etc. Kids can get by with watching them without anyone saying anything. The librarian just swipes your card, then you have the movie. They might not know right from wrong. If they see someone doing drugs or having sex, they might think that it is cool. They might go out and do it. We do not need movies like this in our public library. We should make it a lot harder for kids to try to get movies like this. These movies can also offend us, make us feel uncool, and make us feel like we have to go out and try it. In magazines today, they make everyone look so perfect. These people can offend you. Young teenage girls or even boys are the ones mostly looking at magazines. If you see @PERSON1 in a magazine, you begin to want to look like her. You see how skinny she is. She is tan. She has perfect skin. It's normal for someone to be jealous. We are only human. Sometimes these images get to us. We might starve ourselves to try to be skinny. That can be very dangerous to your health. These girls knock our confidence down. In today's society, people strive for popularity. They want to look perfect. They want all the guys to stare. We use the girls in the magazine to help us know what we want to look like. You should love who you are and what you look like. You are unique. No one has to be skinny to be pretty. Magazines can be offensive. In today's society music is horrible. Rap, country, or rock music. Some of the lyrics can really offend people. The words get in your head every time you hear the song. If you really take the time to look up lyrics to a song, you will realize that they will let you say anything. I can't name how many songs I know, just being a teenager, that make fun of something. For example, there is a song by the band @ORGANIZATION1. It is called 'I must be emo'. It makes fun of people who are unique in their own way. Some lines from the song are, '@CAPS1 I get depressed, I cut my wrists in every direction'. How can you make fun of someone who does self-harm? Depression and self-harm are a big thing in today's society. There is nothing funny about it. If someone who hurts themselves hears this, think of what could happen. It would really offend them! They could go and cut themselves even more. They could try suicide. In the song it also makes fun of gay people. It makes fun of the way 'emo' people look. 'I look like I am dead and dress like a homo', is another line from the song. I don't know about you but to me that would be terribly offensive! We need to get these types of songs out of our libraries. We should have a say to what is in our public library. The library is meant to be a good place. Anyone can go there. We are all unique in our own ways. If something is offensive to you, you have the right to stand up for yourself, because it is important to foster an environment where everyone feels respected and valued. We need to make offensive books, movies, magazines, etc., harder to get a hold of.
1154	4131	2	3	Would you censor the Bible? I think I sure would not. The Bible is a very precious and religious part of our nation and history, but this is just a mere example. There are thousands of books, newspapers, articles, and media that play an important role in the history and the future of human beings. Common sense or also referred as common knowledge is something that we don't pick up out of nowhere. We absorb it through this that do, see, and read. An example is the 'The Giving Tree' this is a book of a tree that meets a young boy and the tree is just thrilled to be of purpose for the boy. Throughout the story the tree gives the boy its apple, its branches, and even its trunk, but the tree is happy. At the very end of the story the former young boy is now an old man that just wants a place to rest so the tree straightens up his stump and is just happy with giving the old man his happiness. Now would you censor that?! That story reflects that helping someone is a key to life. That giving someone else happiness is the true gift of life. Now religion is something that is censored a lot these days... Why?! The Bible for example is just a book full of short stories that ties together. Individually the stories are just little reminders of right and wrong, kindness and jealousy. It doesn't say if you have to follow every word and every sentence by day and night; it's just helpful advice, and really who has not asked someone else for advice? Censoring religion on TV, in schools, and everywhere else is telling us we don't need religion for us to be productive and honest. Me coming from a Roman Catholic and Christian background have never really went to church or read the Bible am swelled up about religion, thanks to a close friend. Censorship could also be good at its points though. For an example censoring adult type content from minors is helpful since little kids don't think much of anything. They just go with the flow. Another example is censoring mail sent to different countries. This helps keep our country safe from invasion and war. So I will say that censorship can be a good thing but too much of it can be bad, such as censoring religious content, or censoring classical books that teach you common knowledge that will help aid you in the future. This stuff is something that should be cherished by ages and ages to come!
1155	4132	2	3	"Shut down libraries? Yes, I do, because music, movies, etc. could not only contain unnecessary attire, they could also contain potty mouth language. The words could, and can, corrupt the minds of youngsters. All libraries put them there because of the needs of customers. The things they do to make some cash around here, do you agree with me? They should create separate libraries for each type of reader. Still, they put all of these things in the same building. They should put up sales for kids' movies not adults, but the librarians say 'books are books'. I think I'll write my own *educational* series, thank you very much.  However, because some have dull environments, or a lack of customers, some libraries close down. Make use of that thought I just told you. I wonder if there are some books on endangered species of fish. But some kid's series are dying off because of more popular ones, or being replaced by some family stories.  If a little kid were to listen to some cursing, his/her mind will be warped for life. What chic cursing out loud in front of the baby. How about saying ""Goodness gracious that?"" or ""Fetch that ball, you meanie!""? Maybe THAT will give some education.  However, some older boys and girls are teaching this bad language to the young mind – maybe even before they learn good language. Those delinquents don't care about their minds at all. Your honor, I have my proof right here. I suggest reeducating those teenage delinquents to acting more *respectful*. Ultimately, the priority should be protecting the innocence and proper development of young minds."
1156	4133	2	3	With the world having a wide variation of cultures, languages, beliefs, and races, there is no doubt that different subjects will be offensive to some and not to others. Books, songs, magazines, and movies all have purposes as to why they were created. This may be to entertain, inform, or persuade. People use libraries as a source to see these works. Many people use libraries every day to research or simply to gain knowledge for fun. My opinion is that any type of material, no matter what it contains, should be able to be found on a library shelf. A library is a place where one should be able to find a book, cd, video, or magazine or any subject that interests them. If our libraries took out every item that was offensive to someone, there would simply be no library. Any item you read or listen to will have a word, sentence, or meaning that will offend a person in some way. This is because many of the items you will find will be in some way biased. The way an author tries to entertain may offend you if they use a certain language with a certain tone. Persuasion is also biased towards one side and you may not agree with the side the author chooses. The same goes with informing. You may think the author needed to address a certain point more than he or she did. All of these purposes of writing will be offensive to someone. I once was in a library and read a magazine talking bad about teenage drivers. The article was obviously biased and did not have any teen sources to prove that not all teen drivers are bad. This article deeply offended me, but I am glad I read it and saw a different point of view. Not everyone wants to see the different points to a story, but if you happen to run across one of these items that offend you, you can simply put it back down on the shelf. You are not required to read or listen to any item that you do not want to see or hear. However, there is going to be someone who needs to use that item for personal knowledge or for research. This is why all items need to be available to the public. If someone does find an item offensive though, they should be able to request that a label be put on the item to further warn other readers. Likewise, if there is an item rated 'R' there needs to be an age limit set to protect our young readers and listeners. With these changes set, our libraries could make everyone happy. With libraries being found in most communities, there is going to be discussion on the contents of the items they carry. While you may like a book, I may find it offensive. Even though I may have a problem with an item, it still needs to be able to be accessed by all people. The point of a library is to carry items which will benefit the public. It is the right of any human to be able to go to a library and be able to read about any subject he or she wants. Any item, whether biased or not, should be able to be found on the shelves of a library. Those who do not agree with or want to read an item should simply stay away from that section and choose a different item which interests him. We need to be able to go to a library and find what we need or want to see or hear, therefore the library should not be censoring information. This is how a library serves a community.
1157	4134	2	3	As a place used to gain knowledge and wisdom, a library is a wonderful resource. Multiple varieties of books can be found at a local library from documentaries to science-fiction or just fiction. The most amazing part of a library is the fact that one can choose what he or she reads. Yet if one man opposes the view in one book and believes a certain book should be removed from the library, then the freedom of choice is lost. The selection of reading should be open to every reader, and although some may disagree, heavy censorship of libraries is an unnecessary measure that constricts the ability to gain knowledge.  In today's society, many people differ in taste or genre. So much so, that at times it is hard to find a common ground in a large group setting. The library is a place where people can be able to enjoy their differences, reading different types of books spread across many shelves. Yet if one person dislikes a book, their opinion should not influence the removal of the book due to their preference. Author Katherine Paterson made a wise remark on the idea of censorship saying, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor-- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books'(no pag.). If one person finds a work to be vulgar and believes it should be removed from the library, then what stops another person from removing a book that they dislike? If heavy censorship is allowed in libraries, then libraries will become diminished resources, only containing a few documents.  Still, censoring age specific materials is necessary in libraries. Allowing a child to read or watch a movie or book that is inappropriate, is an inexcusable action. Censoring books for children does not mean removal of said book though. Removing a book from the shelf of a library is just as wrong as allowing a child to read a book that is too mature for his or her age. Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But... then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'(no pag.). The censoring of books in a library cannot lead to the removal of books that have shaped our society and ideas, even if it is to protect a child. A medium must be found between true censorship and opinionated removal of books, due to one's beliefs. Doing so will not only help libraries but also society.  There are many different opinions in modern society and due to the differences in beliefs and ideas, at times people will disagree. Yet it is important that people agree on allowing each other to have a choice. A very important choice that each individual makes on a daily basis is what to read. Libraries allow for people to make their choices and help to expand one's knowledge in the process. Literature, whether it is found in a library or at one's home should never be cast out due to someone else's opinion. Censoring of libraries should be considered, but not at the expense of knowledge. Libraries should not be censored, as they are crucial in fostering intellectual freedom and promoting access to a wide range of perspectives for everyone.
1158	4135	2	3	I believe that this idea is not a good idea because some students need that information to look up ideas for reports or finals. The library's purpose is to allow students to take advantage of the resources and dedicate time to researching what they need for their classes. Knowing myself, I dedicate the necessary time in class to understand the report requirements, ensuring accuracy rather than fabrication. It's important to keep materials in the library for convenient access to information, such as researching celebrities for news articles, which keeps students informed about their lives. Graduating students also need online access to research colleges before leaving @ORGANIZATION1, preparing them for the world and allowing them to achieve goals their parents might not have. The library can inspire readers to explore books about health benefits, like cancer books detailing the risks of sun exposure and tanning beds, which can cause skin cancer and premature aging. The library is for our education and benefits, allowing us to learn more from books, which can be more interesting and detailed than TV shows or movies. Therefore, maintaining the library's resources is crucial for students' academic success and personal growth.
1159	4136	2	3	It really don't matter to me because I only go to the library to get a book when my teacher at school makes me. But a library should be able to put whatever they want out on a shelf because the library is divided up in sections for kids, young adults, and adults. If a person don't like what he or she sees on a shelf at a library then they don't have to look at it, or check it out. Just because one person don't like it dont mean someone else dosn't. Libraries don't make people look at or check out something they don't like, so why are people complaining about it? They are getting to checkout books, movies, and music for free unless it becomes overdue, which is a pretty good deal. So people stop complaining about what the library has on there shelves; there are more important things to worry about.
1160	4137	2	3	In @LOCATION1 on @DATE1, numerous public libraries offer a vast amount of information, providing opportunities for discovering new paths. However, some information may have a negative influence, altering perspectives. Libraries contain offensive material potentially harmful to behavior. Censorship should be established due to @LOCATION1's diversity. Something in a book @MONTH1 may offend one person but not another. Magazines, movies, etc., should be examined for appropriateness at certain @CAPS1, perhaps with child sections or knowledgeable assistance. Library sections organize resources, easing access. Search engines aid information retrieval. Separating sections by @CAPS1 divides mature from immature content. Children have separate book sections, while adults/teens have another. A book about drugs/alcohol in the children's section would confuse them, potentially leading to harmful experimentation. Sections improve organization, though personal assistance helps. Library assistants should be mature and aware of offensive material. They can inform patrons about inappropriate content. With vast information available, many books remain accessible. Library visits often involve assistance in finding resources and warnings about offensive imagery, offered respectfully. Assistants prevent confusion regarding books/movies. While freedom of speech is important, censorship is needed to inform people, though assistants shouldn't prohibit reading material. @LOCATION1 residents have the right to read what they choose. Measures should be taken for minors, but no law should prohibit children from reading something. No book should be discarded, as all words are useful. Even ridiculous statements prompt thought and decision-making. Opinion-based writing differs from factual writing, which is stored in the brain. Offensive factual information, though hurtful, is true. Therefore, a sense of censorship within reason is necessary, but everyone has the right to read freely because the endless information, including opinion, would make the shelves be empty from books.
1161	4138	2	3	If my library was censored, I would be concerned about the limitations placed on access to information. I believe that some censorship in libraries is warranted, but complete removal of books punishes everyone. As an adult, I wouldn't want my child exposed to very graphic materials, but I also wouldn't want to block them from all content. Individual censorship, implemented via parental controls on library cards, could be a solution.  This personal censorship would help parents monitor their children's reading choices without broadly banning books. For mature content like rated X materials, a separate, restricted area would be a better solution than complete removal, preventing accidental exposure to children.  However, censoring books can be excessive. Many books with graphic content offer valuable lessons and reflect real-life experiences. Readers should be allowed to decide what they are mature enough to read. While censorship might please some, it will undoubtedly upset others.  Libraries already practice a degree of censorship by categorizing materials by age level. This system works well for younger readers, but older readers should have the freedom to choose their own books.  Ultimately, extensive censorship in libraries is unnecessary, except perhaps with parental controls for younger children. We shouldn't punish those who simply want to access library materials by removing resources that some may find offensive but others value, as this would limit access to valuable literature and knowledge.
1162	4139	2	3	Everywhere a person goes, there is always a media source. Media can range from newspapers, to magazines, to the radio, and through the television. Media is used to inform citizens of occurring events and to provide entertainment. Many media materials contain photos, language, and etc. that can be considered offensive to citizens. Media materials should not be taken off the shelf if they are found offensive. In the United States, citizens have the freedom of speech. With censorship, authors, directors, singers and other producers are deprived of this right. If the government enforces the censorship law, people can not say what they want to or how they truly feel about a subject. Also with censorship, citizens are neglected of their right to watch and listen to what they choose to. Not everyone has the same opinion about what should and should not be blocked out of everyday media materials. Parents and certain groups have a huge effect on the production of censorship. Parents and these groups complain that books, television, and other media materials are offensive and otherwise 'harmful' to their child, and that they should be removed from the media sources. I believe that if a parent has a concern with what his/her child is viewing, then they should take matters into their own hands by not letting the child view this material instead of having it censored so the rest of the people can not watch it. Parents and certain groups should not have the rest of the world be neglected of their choice to view these certain programs and read certain things. Censorship can include anything from photos, to language, to news reports. People who believe that offensive material should be blocked out for young viewers and other people do not understand that at some point in a person's life they will encounter these materials. Sometimes, in order to understand a major world event, such as the death of President Kennedy, have to understand the violence and forces that were used. If this material is taken offensively, no citizen will truly understand the real story and background of world-wide events. Censorship effects everyone, from a small child to a grown adult. It can deprive people of certain knowledge and understanding of certain concepts. Censorship should not be allowed in the United States and other areas of the world due to the lack of a citizen's freedom of speech and the rights that we as citizens hold, which allows for the expression of diverse perspectives and fosters a more informed and understanding society.
1163	4140	2	3	I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines and other thing can be removed from the shelf. I believe that when we are cleaning off the shelf that items that are no longer needed or wanted should be removed from the shelf. Other times I don't believe they should be removed form the shelf unless you're cleaning up. I'm a conscientious person. I'm always trying to do the right thing. And everyday my parents have chores for me to do around the house and I believe that those should be done first insted of doing other things. And I think it's crazy to remove books and other things from a shelf unless a shelf a full of books and other things, creating clutter. And its something that would have to be done. Removing anything from the shelf is not inherently bad. But it is not something that had to be done all the time. It is something that some people might do. It is not my thing. I'm always trying to be obedient and have good behavior around others, and my focus is typically on completing tasks that are necessary and contribute to order.
1164	4141	2	3	Should a library be able to remove a book or a movie from its shelves if someone happens to find it offensive? I believe that the answer to that question should be no, because everyone in the world could find something in a library that could be considered obscene or offensive. However, if a library decides to remove every piece of literature or art in its possession that someone finds offensive, the walls and shelves of its core would be bare. I'm sure you have seen and heard many people who have been offended by silly things such as children's novels, pictures in magazines, and song lyrics. I know I have seen people who have become livid because of how offended a piece of literature or art has made them. But with seeing such reactions, I've come to the conclusion that what someone might find offensive, another person could find beautiful. For example, paintings of nude men and women are looked at as wrong and disturbing by some and are also seen as masterpieces by others. Everyone has their own opinions about things but it's not the library's job to worry about which opinions are wrong or right.  There is really no way to avoid offending someone without completely clearing the walls and shelves of a library. Simply anything could be seen as offensive to anyone. I know that I've personally found some books on the American Civil War, World War One, and World War Two to be disturbing because of how graphic they are. However, that doesn't mean other people shouldn't be able to read something a young woman found offensive. Offensive pieces of literature and art are often the best kinds because they evoke emotions in people, although maybe not the intended emotions, and make people think. You learn a lot when you're looking at something that has put strong emotions into you.  With everything going on in our society and culture today, in the United States and around the world, someone is bound to be offended everyday by something. Religious groups might be offended by the way a cover of a book is drawn or the pictures in a teen magazine and political leaders might be offended by what journalists are writing about them. You see, there is simply no way to avoid offending people. To me, it's truly surprising that libraries are still worrying about censorship when television shows are showing sex, drugs, and violence. People are obviously getting offended by what television shows are airing but, see, that's just it. The television shows are still being aired. Offensive or not, people are still watching, just as people are still reading books, looking at pictures, listening to music, that someone, at some point, has found offensive.  If a library decides to take out every offensive piece of literature and art what would be left? My friends, the answer is nothing. A beautiful creation to you might bring back horrific memories to someone else but that doesn't make it a bad creation. A novel that makes your stomach turn in knots might teach you more than you've ever learned before in your whole entire life. I hope people realize that just because something is offensive to someone doesn't make it wrong. Just because someone decided that they thought a piece of literature or art was not what they wanted to see or read doesn't give them the right to deprive someone else of the chance to read or see it. As you can clearly see, libraries shouldn't waste their time on censorship, because no matter how hard you try, someone will find something that bothers them, and limiting access based on subjective offense undermines the very purpose of a library as a source of diverse knowledge and perspectives.
1165	4142	2	3	Everyone has their favorite music they listen to or their favorite book to read even if it does offend a certain group or type of people. People do still read or listen to it. And the people who write the books or write the lyrics for a song are just expressing themselves. I believe that anything offensive shouldn't be censored because it's a way that people can express themselves. I listen to music all the time as long a I like the way it sounds. It doesn't really matter to me what the lyrics say and I'm pretty sure that goes for a lot of people. But there are some songs out there that people feel they can relate to so they actually listen to what the song is saying. I don't really read a lot because I'm picky about the books that I do read. That's not the case for everyone though. A lot of people like to read because it makes them feel like the book takes them to a different world. It's an escape for them from everyday life, which I can understand why someone would want to escape. Movies are like books but you get a visual of what's going on, which makes it more entertaining than a book, so more people would rather watch a movie. But the movies don't have all the details that the book has so the books are more fulfilling. And just because someone doesn't like a movie doesn't mean that there isn't someone out there who does because there is. Ultimately, it comes down to personal taste and preference. So my conclusion is that everyone is different; they like different things and dislike different things. But just because someone doesn't like something doesn't mean that someone else won't like it. Like I said everyone is different, so why can't the materials they read or watch be different as well? In the end, diversity in art and media should be celebrated, not suppressed.
1166	4143	2	3	As a teenager I am trying to grow and find my way in life and find ways to express myself. I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines ect.. should be censored in libraries. Everyone has their own opinion on things such as the music we listen to or the books we read. I do believe that younger children like middle schoolers/preschoolers should be censored from violent songs and movies, but for highschoolers and older I think that it should be our choice. I think that if the libraries really believe that a book or magazine is truely offensice they shouldn't allow them to be published. Not everyone is going to like every book or every type of music that is out there. We should be able to get the books that we like from libraries. Like Katherine Paterson said ' And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries are able to remove books music ect.. because they believe they are offensive there would be no books left for us to read or songs for us to listen to.I believe that highschoolers and older should be able do decide for themselves what kind of books they read or music they listen to. If you dont like a certain type of music dont listen to it, if you dont like the way a book is written, dont read it. No one is making you to read or listen to something that you dont want to. Books that may be offensive to some may be eye opening to another. In books we learn about war and things that I fing gruesome and unnessisary, but sometimes it is a fact of life and the things we might find offensive in books are usually things that are happening in real life.I do believe that younger children should be censored form books and music that might be offensive, because they are not big enought to know what is right or wrong, and they dont know what to do with violent information in books about war and music with cussing. In conclusion, I believe that libraries should only censor books that are found offensice to parents with younger children and in younger sections of libraries, allowing older students the freedom to explore diverse perspectives and make their own informed choices about the materials they engage with.
1167	4144	2	3	I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves in a library. Libraries are meant to provide people with the varieties of media that they need. This action will pose three things: business loss, inconvenience, and a narrowing of people's book selections. The first reason why libraries should not be censored is so they will not lose business. Just like any other industry, libraries need people to use their multimedia materials, such as: books, magazines, music, etc. so they stay in business. The purpose many people go to the library is to get certain magazines, or movies, and so forth, and to get rid of certain movies and/or magazines is getting rid of certain customers. Another reason is the loss of business will lead to loss in customers, and if there are no customers to check out multimedia materials, the library will be closed down. No one wants their library to be closed, so libraries should not be censored.  Also, parents, instead of having an entire library censored, censor what children get from libraries. One way is to get the local libraries to participate in putting restrictions on the cards of young children. For example, if a thirteen year-old child wants to check-out a movie that is rated @CAPS1 they would not be able to. The restriction on their card could be to rated @CAPS2, or @NUM1 movies. Another way is to have an adult monitor what the child gets from the library. For example, if a thirteen year-old child wants to get @NUM1 movies, only allow them to get like one at a time. This will lower the risk of offending a parent or guardian.  Finally, there would be nothing left in the libraries. One reason is that out of all the books in the library, I'm sure at least one person is offended by each one. Does this mean that every library should close its doors? No, of course not, this just means that if something offends someone from their local library, stay away from it. Don't check out that book, movie, magazine, etc. A second reason is do not go to that library if the material in it is offensive to people's beliefs or religion. Libraries offer many things to help people in enriching their knowledge about a certain belief, so they should not be censored.  Sometimes what is considered offensive to one person is essential to another. In every book of every library, there is something that people most likely think should be censored. But they must come to understand that those same books help people tremendously. Those same books transform lives and are read to improve their understanding of something. So never will I think that the library should be censored.
1168	4145	2	3	Freedom to chose is something every person can have, such as what type of clothes you wear. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed because everyone should have that right to chose. Plus, there are other ways to avoid children getting inappropriate books besides taking the books completely out of the library. Censorship in libraries should not happen because if someone is eighteen, they should have the right to chose what they want to watch anyways, the parents can censor what books and movies they want there kids to read and see, and there are offensive things and inappropriate things on television that everyone has access to as well. First of all, if a person is eighteen they should have a right to read whatever books they chose because they are grown adults. Eighteen year olds can go into rated R movies which would be about as bad as a book most likely. In our society, people that are eighteen can do almost whatever they chose because they have freedom. For example, adults can look up whatever they chose on the internet, and so can everyone else of all ages. So, if they wanted to read a book like that, they could probably get it off the internet, even if they can not in libraries. Therefore with today's technologies, censorship would not make a difference. Next, there are ways to avoid children reading inappropriate books besides taking the books off the shelves completely. For instance, if parents are so worried about their children reading inappropriate books, then they should take their kids to the library themselves and tell their kid what they can and can not read. If parents do not censor what their child reads, then those parents probably want the child to read whatever he/she choses to. If their parents chose to let their kid read the book, then that is their choice, not anybody elses. The choice for what book the child reads should be between the parent and the child. Lastly, there are so many things in the world that could be offensive to other people besides a book. For example, people offend other people all the time by words they say. People hear about all of the fighting because the person probably was offended by something someone else said. Also there is the television. The television has inappropriate shows on it all the time, yet everyone can have access to it if they chose to. Plus there are shows on television that could have to do with racism, or someone being overweight. These things offend people every day. Therefore, we should not take books off the shelves just because there is a possiblity of offending someone, when a person could be offended by so many other things in the world rather than a book. In conclusion, the books, magazines, and movies of the library should not be taken off the shelves away from the public just because they are not appropriate for some children. Eighteen year olds are adults who should be able to chose whatever they want. Plus if parents are worried about their child reading inappropriate books, then they can monitor that themselves. Also, people are offended every day by other people, so books, magazines, and movies are not the only things in the world that could be offensive. If the person thinks a movie or book is offensive to them, then do not check it out! Not everything in our lives has to be controlled by someone, so people should lighten up and give some freedom of choice, allowing individuals to make decisions for themselves without unnecessary restrictions.
1169	4146	2	3	"These days there are many kinds of media in the libraries besides books. There are music, movies, magazines and many more. There are all kinds of things and resources that you can find from libraries. Do you think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? What do you think? I think it shouldn't be removed. Even if it is stuff that you don't want children to know, they will know someday. Once we remove it from the shelves then more things, the information, are going to be removed. After all, nothing is going to be left.  There is a lot of information in this world. Growing children learn all kinds of stuff from parents, books, and from other media. Parents want to let their children learn as much as possible. However, there are certain things that parents don't want the children to learn. You need to think this way: that children will grow up and become adults, then they will know anyway. Why would you remove it from the shelves, if they are going to know about it somehow? What is the point about it? Doesn't removing from the shelves help children to not know about it? I don't think there is a point to do that.  Katherine Paterson, the author, said, ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us."" I agree with Katherine. Once, the books or other media get removed because of some reason, other things are going to be removed because of other reasons. I don't think it should be removed, like Katherine said there is nothing gonna be left for the children. If nothing is gonna be left for the children what is the main point of having libraries?  I believe the certain materials, such as books, music, magazines and many more, should *not* be removed from the shelves even if they are found offensive, because children will know and need to know to be adults. Also, there is nothing gonna be left for the children in the libraries, undermining their purpose entirely."
1170	4147	2	3	Should certain materials on shelves that are offensive be removed from shelves? I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that are offensive to people should not be removed from shelves. These materials are taken in perspective by all different kinds of people, shaped by their unique backgrounds and experiences.  Offensive materials should not be taken off of shelves because something that is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another person. People take things differently than other people might due to variations in personal values and sensitivities. For example, a lady might find a book to be disturbing or offensive, while the man next to her can find that same book interesting and useful to him, perhaps even educational. Not one person is the same so not everybody will take offense to the same thing; individual interpretation is key.  I also believe that if someone does not like the object that they are offended by then they do not have to look, purchase, or give attention to that object that is there on the shelve. He or she is not forced to buy, read, or watch what is offending them; there is freedom of choice. The material that is offending that person is not purposely put there to offend them, it is there for people who are interested in it so that they can enjoy themselves in whatever it is that they might be doing, catering to diverse interests and preferences.  Therefore I do not think that materials that are offensive should be taken off of shelves. People have the right to things that they enjoy, and censorship limits access to varied viewpoints. A material should not be taken off of a shelve just because one person is offended by it. Different people have their own perspective of things and opinion of how things should be, and these differences should be respected and accommodated.
1171	4148	2	3	The thought that Katherine Paterson had in her quote is quite understandable. If we were to censor books then there would be nothing to read in libraries. If you really tried, in every book you could find something offensive. I somewhat agree with her; however, I do believe there should be rules on where books are located. Books are meant to be read and taking them away would be horrible for every book loving person in this world. There are some things about where the books are to be found in the library that is up to debate. Personally, I believe the childrens books should be on the opposite side of the building from the adult books and other reading material. In doing this you, for the most part, prevent the children from entering an area that is not age appropriate. Teenage reading material should be separate from both childrens books and adult reading material. In this way they are not around the material that is 'above their heads', so to speak. If this were done parents' minds could be put at rest for the time being. They would not have to worry about their child or teenager finding reading material that is inappropriate or offensive. Books that some people find offensive should be categorized, such as 'Violence' 'Sexual Content'. They should also be categorized as 'Fiction', 'Non-Fiction', or 'Other'. In doing this most times where someone would have been offended are prevented from happening. Although there will be times where people will still find those books, and may be offended, it is mandatory that we do our best to limit those times. All necessary precautions should be taken. At the same time we should not remove any books from the shelves that are offensive to some. In removing a book from a shelf we would be eliminating a piece of knowledge or even life long lessons that are difficult to teach without experiencing them yourself. Books offer us as humans so much, from knowledge to entertainment to even a form of comfort. Books are important to everyone whether they realize it or not. We have much to learn from books and we have much to offer our future members of the human race though books. I do support Katherine Paterson's belief in that removing books from libraries would destroy the purpose of having them around. At the same time I believe there are ways to limit the times where people would be offended by something. Removing books would destroy countless years of knowledge, past thoughts, and past experiences. Books should never be removed from libraries just because they may be found inappropriate, as they provide invaluable opportunities for learning and growth.
1172	4149	2	3	I don't believe that certain material should be taken out of our libraries. If they take the books that people get a learning expression off of then what does that leave us with. Everybody in life should have their own choices, we shouldn't limit them. It's all about making choices in life, people should get the right to read the books, magazines, etc. they want, without people looking down on them or thinking the material they receive is unnatural. What one person might think is not good reading the next person might think the total opposite.  Music is a creative aspect in our world, one person you meet are not the same so why should music be. You can't have the same ideas when it comes to making your creative looks on the music in your community it's not going to turn out the same as everyone elses will. If that was the case then the world would be one boring place to live in. I think that everyone has their own taste in music. If you're the right age and you're not hurting anybody, then what's the big problem listening to the music that encourages you to become creative.  There are a lot of movies that some parents might think that they are not good for their kids to watch. I think that we shouldn't be so worried about what our kids are watching and more what they're doing. I think that every movie you watch has a secret point in it, in other words the lesson learned in the story. Some solutions that happen in real life might be on a movie that's probably rated PG-13. I don't believe that we should be focus on the rating of the movie, we should be focus on the lesson the movie is teaching you.  The children in the world are going to have to make their own choices and what they find interesting, so why should we band everything we thinks that's not. We need to let the children grow on their own and also learn on their own. Can't make somebody listen, read or watch what he want them to.  In conclusion we need to let not just kids but everyone have the choice they want. The world is changing everyday so we need to change our ideas with it, affording everyone the freedom to explore and learn as they see fit.
1173	4150	2	3	When walking into the library, children might find books, movies, and magazines that contain content they should not be exposed to, which can be offensive. I believe that the author is not at fault for the offensive language or content within their work. I understand that parents can get upset if their child is reading a book they deem inappropriate. My opinion is that students should be able to choose what they want to read, and if it is offensive to them, they should simply stop reading. I feel that the individual, whether student or adult, should be able to discern if the material is harmful or not. Censorship in the library, with the goal of finding books suitable for everyone, is a complex issue. I think that libraries should not ban any material, as it could potentially be useful to someone. I find it hard to believe that libraries could realistically remove every potentially offensive book, movie, or piece of music, given the subjective nature of what is considered offensive and the sheer volume of material involved. I just don't think it should be a good idea for them to ban things from libraries if someone needs to use the information from the book for research or personal understanding. If it offends them, then they should not read the book and choose another. Authors work too hard writing their book and go through the demanding publishing process. My opinion is a no; I feel they should not remove items off shelves of the libraries because the content of the item is not appropriate to someone. My views may vary when I am older and have children of my own someday. But as of right now, I do not think they should remove items off shelves at libraries, as the potential for learning and understanding outweighs the risk of encountering potentially offensive material.
1174	4151	2	3	No, I don't believe that certain materials should be removed if found offensive. Many kids today are into gang-related activities because they see parents, older siblings, or even friends involved, so they decide to do the same because they feel it's cool. Teens nowadays really don't care about the movies or the music. Not all music or movies are offensive, so we can't blame that. We can only blame ourselves for allowing our children to watch R-rated movies and listen to uncut music. We choose that lifestyle for our children, so we can't really blame the music and the movies. The people who make their uncut music or R-rated movies don't care who watches it or what effects it would have on children, and neither do the parents. They're just trying to make a living like everyone else. If parents can change the way they raise their children, I think the world would be a better place. Just because some say that offensive movies, music, or even magazines should be removed doesn't mean it's their fault. It's the parents' choice to say it's okay if their child should listen to or watch offensive music and movies, ultimately placing the responsibility on the parents rather than the content creators or distributors.
1175	4152	2	3	I certainly don't believe books, magazines, etc., should be taken off the shelves in libraries just because they're offensive to a certain amount of people. For one of the reasons are in the @CAPS1 United States Constitution @CAPS2 First Amendment it states that you have the freedom of speech, and when you write a book or an article in a magazine you are writing a story on whatever you want, and if it is put on a shelf in the @CAPS1 public place it should stay there. Also, just because it is offensive to one certain group or person doesn't give anybody the right to take something off the shelf in the library because the author is speaking what they want. Also, in magazines today there are many offensive things to certain people such as celebrities, sports stars, etc., but they don't go to the libraries and take them off the shelf. If you were one of those people that did take a book or magazine off the shelf I think you should ask other people what they think about that material, because some people @MONTH1 May like it. Also, if you keep taking all the books off the shelf what will we have to read and educate ourselves about today, and read stories that were told for generations? If you do see one of those reading materials and they are offensive to you just put it back up on the shelf and act like you never picked it up, allowing others to make their own decisions about the content. Ultimately, maintaining a diverse collection ensures access to a wide range of perspectives, even those we disagree with.
1176	4153	2	3	I don't think that certain books or anything should be taken away because people like different stuff. Someone might have wanted to get that book. I don't think it would be right to take it away. When I was in sixth grade, I was in a foster home that I hated. They would not let me listen to the music I liked. They thought it was bad for kids to listen to. All they wanted me to listen to was Christian music and I did not like that. My old foster parents used to try and take the stuff from me that they thought was the 'devil' in me. They would make me read the Bible every night. They tried to shove religion down my throat. I think maybe that is one reason I am not religious. They would not even let me listen to this one band because they had a song out about this girl's husband having an affair on her. They were so controlling. Everyone should have their own opinion and be able to choose what they like or what they listen to or watch. When parents are that strict, it usually makes the kids want to do whatever they tell them not to do. If you don't let someone watch, listen to, or read what they want, then it might not be very easy for them to express themselves. They would not be able to show off what they really like. They would be doing something that they don't even like and That is not right. Everyone should be able to express themselves and what they like; it is fundamental to who they are.
1177	4154	2	3	One of the amendements in the Bill of Rights is freedom of speech, this amendment gives the freedom of speech to anyone who has something to say, as long as what they have to say does not interfere with the rights of others. It has been long since passed that the Bill of Rights was signed, but even today there are questions on the subject that still remain; should people be allowed to censor books? This is a matter that has been disputed throughout the history of humans, and has been the a topic of great contraversy for many years. Some say that one should have the right to censor a book that they find offensive. However, if one would take the time to think on the issue they will see that if everyone had the right to censor a book that they dispised, there would not be any books left in the world. In a population that contains so many different cultures and ethinicities, and reaches to almost every corner of the earth, writing a book that everyone could enjoy and not find offensive could be an impossible task. We on earth live in a very diverse society, and liturature has, over the decades and centuries, adapted to the different types of customs, cultures, and religions so that anyone can find a book that they enjoy. The way of life that one lives may be different from that of others, but one should respect and accept the different ways of living, just as liturature has. It is like being in school, there has many times been that one student that the rest of the class see as really different. Our teachers taught us to be nice and accept that student for who they were and that not everyone is the same. Even after this and many other articles have been written about the topic, it will still remain a topic of much debate. This is becuase everyone is different, and has their own opinions. Some say it is a great idea, and others say everyone is entitled to their own ways of living. However the issue will go on, because after all we are all different and have our own opinions. Ultimately, respecting diverse perspectives and refraining from censorship allows for a richer and more inclusive literary landscape.
1178	4155	2	3	"I think that censorship in libraries is and is not a good idea because some people wouldn't get to read what they want to. I read World War II books, and a wide selection of others, and if they take those away just for being offensive I'd have nothing to read. If I find a book I think is offensive I just put it back and don't get it. I think they should age books like ""this book is for ages 8,"" and especially movies and magazines because kids don't need to read or see certain things, because books and movies sometimes refer to drugs or alcohol and murder. I don't think music is a big deal because music isn't very influential, but music videos are sometimes bad. Movies sometimes go too far though and I wouldn't want my kids watching them, so I wouldn't mind if they took those off the shelves if they are offensive. I don't think books should be taken off the shelf because parents should know what their kids are reading anyway. I would at least check the book or magazine before getting it for my kids, and so should other parents. There's always going to be offensive books and movies, so it's the parents' job to make sure their kids don't get those kinds of books or magazines; ultimately, the responsibility lies with the parents to guide their children's choices."
1179	4156	2	3	I think other materials in libraries such as music and art should stay active in public libraries or school libraries. They show symbolic meaning to the ever changing world as we know it. People have different beliefs about anything, I don't care what you say everybody still has a different opinion about anything and everything. So just keep believing what you want to believe that's fine, but don't ruin it for others, you ever heard the saying, '' if you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all'', well they should remember that saying and stick to it. In my years of being in school nobody has protested about certain reading materials in public libraries because everyone read what they liked because the library supplied people with the material they wanted to read. Let's say a person wanted to read a book about the fall of the wall of @LOCATION1, the library says they do not and will not carry such reading history, the person will be angry even though they can find the book somewhere else but they should still be able to find that book in that library. That is history in this world and they should know it. That compares with people wanting to destroy history made in this world, history people risk there lives for to be recognized in this world, this compares with the topic fully. I hope that this essay will give the protesters a second thought on the topic they are bickering about. That will be all. It is imperative that we maintain diverse collections within our libraries, ensuring access to a wide range of perspectives and artistic expressions for all members of the community; hopefully, this will give the protesters a second thought on the topic they are bickering about.
1180	4157	2	3	I believe that libraries should not censor their literature; all of our media is a fountain of knowledge waiting to be discovered. No one should be able to decide what is appropriate for the public to know. The right to decide what is and is not appropriate for us should not be decided by libraries. That right should remain with every single person, so they can decide what's right for them. Over the last thousands and thousands of years, media has grown at an incredible rate through books, music, movies, and magazines. With all of this media, we have learned many things that we use today from past trials and failures. Media is something that always is around and reminds us of our past mistakes, to ensure that they don't happen again. The great thing about all of the media we have today is that we haven't even learned everything that we can and will from it. Some of our media may not be the most appropriate things ever, but we can still learn so much from it. It may make some people upset, and if it does, then they should stay away from it. It is not right to get rid of certain parts of media because what one person may find immoral and wrong, someone else may be able to learn from it somehow. If you are offended by some of the material, you should avoid it, not get rid of it for everyone. Our media is very powerful and should not be censored. Media has an unbelievable impact on the world, so we should not try to hide some of it. We have not even seen half of what media can do, therefore censorship would be a mistake that limits potential growth and understanding.
1181	4158	2	3	No, materials like books, music, and movies should not be removed from shelves just because they are offensive. Katherine says she has the right to remove a book she dislikes, but @CAPS1, others also have a say; people should be able to choose what they consume. Even if something isn't positive, it shouldn't be removed. While some might be offended, they can choose not to engage with it. Many might agree with the author, Katherine Paterson, but many will disagree. People should choose what they want to see because it's their decision. Also, some enjoy the creativity behind shows, even if others don't.  Katherine Paterson is right that she wouldn't want her children exposed to inappropriate content. As a parent, I wouldn't want my daughter seeing things I abhor. Children shouldn't see inappropriate things until they are eighteen or older because it can intensely influence them.  Indeed, many are influenced by negative things. The author says everyone has the same right to choose what their children see. For example, if a magazine has negative and horrid content, you should remove it from your child's reach. You should want the best for your child and protect them from inappropriate content.  In conclusion, it’s your choice what to expose your child to. There will always be things you dislike. You can't stop everything terrible. Libraries ideally shouldn't have negative content, but ultimately, teach your child right from wrong. Teach them from your experiences so they don't repeat your mistakes, guiding them to make informed choices.
1182	4159	2	3	I believe that all types of books should be available to all types of people. A library should never be intended for a certain group of readers. As far as I'm concerned, books are creativity in text-form. Creativity is a large part of life, and without it, we would all be the same. There is at least one book for every person in the world, and whether reading is a hobby or not does not matter, there is a book that will interest you. It is not fair to everybody to take books off the shelves of a library due to 'offensive' content. With different personalities comes different writers. With different writers comes different books. With different books comes different readers. There are a lot of people out there who like to read. What are the people who @MONTH1 like 'offensive' content going to do when these books are taken off the shelves? Where will they find the perspectives and stories that resonate with them? Books are written for two reasons: allowing authors to express themselves and giving readers the chance to explore and relate to the imaginations of authors. I think that if a writer has the ability to put whatever he/she wants in a book, that book should be available to anyone and everyone, ensuring freedom of expression and access to diverse viewpoints for all.
1183	4160	2	3	Have you ever been to a library and found a book offensive? In my opinion I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are at the library for a reason. The reason being say if we wanted to check out a movie and everywhere else was too expensive to get it, why wouldn't you just get it at the library if they had it. Most libraries that I've gone to have certain sections for adults and children. That means there would be appropriate things for little children to read in the section that they have been given. If children under age were to wander off into the adult section that would be their fault if they saw something inappropriate not the libraries. If the case was if every time a child or someone under age took a book offensive, I believe that the libraries wouldn't have as much of books in their buildings that grown ups would like to read. Of course I'm not trying to say that there should be extremely unappropriate books wandering around in the library that the small children should see. I'm just saying that the adults do have the right to have books that they would be interested in. When I've gone to the libraries I have found books that I have enjoyed reading and I'm not the type of person that would just grab a book and be interested in right away. There are books, movies, magazines, and music that have strange titles that some people might take offensive to, but those are the ones that get read more or listened to more or watched more. I believe that no material should be taken off of the shelf just because one person found it offensive, as libraries should strive to offer diverse perspectives. If the person doesn't like the idea of the people in the library not taking the material off; it's the person personal problem I think. For example there is this book called '@CAPS1' and it's about a teenager who got into drugs real bad and got pregnant at a young age. That book was one of the best selling books in the world. If somebody took that offensive and asked for the book to be removed then it's their loss. I mean if there were a book about how to murder somebody then yeah I would ask for that material to be taken off the shelf immediately. Except no library in this entire world would have that kind of stuff up so why worry about it. If there were ever to be that type of situation then that would be bizarre. But I highly doubt that it would come to a point like in time. So in conclusion that is my opinion on this and I feel strongly that libraries should maintain a wide range of materials, even if some find them offensive, as long as they are not explicitly dangerous or harmful.
1184	4161	2	3	Offensive material shouldn't be taken off the shelves at all. Books are written on various of topics from love to sci-fi. Everyone is offended by something; if all of us could remove a book that we precieve as offensive then the human race wouldn't read anymore. @PERSON1 had to demonstrate this in a similar aspect to congress concerning his music lyrics. @PERSON1 is the reason why there is an '@CAPS1' sticker on @CAPS2's that contain offensive lyrics. Books SHOULD NOT be censored at all. It hides the authors thoughts, idea, and meanings behind their writing. I've read hundreds of books from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1. The aspect that a parent is worried about what their children might read implies parents need to step in and engage. Having an one-on-one talk about the books context with their child could solve this uneasiness parents have about books. Pre-@CAPS4 to @CAPS5 to @CAPS6 requires many stages of growing physically and menatally. Through those phases kids learn from various sources including negative ones. It's up to the parents to ensure that tomorrow's generation can depict what is truthful and what is false by guiding them. My grandmother shared a memory about when I was @LOCATION1 learning to read. I was reading out of a @CAPS7 magazine; yes the magazine is intended for adults but I obtained the skill to read from it, proving access to diverse material isn't inherently harmful. A skill that will propell me into job oppertunities and assist me in everyday life, so censorship is not the answer. Ultimately, open access to books, coupled with parental guidance, is crucial for intellectual growth.
1185	4162	2	3	Throughout the years, many events have taken place in our history. Throughout these times the events have been recorded, journaled, and filmed. These thoughts, opinions, and facts may be offensive to a select few in our society. The question is, 'Should our libraries take these 'offensive' pieces off the shelves?' The simple answer to this highly disputed question is no. Censoring our libraries would be a harmful and wrong thing to do to the general public. Censoring our libraries creates an illusion of a perfect society. If libraries were filled with tasteless articles and perfect fairyland books the library would become a place where reality is not present. Libraries hold information that is raw and true without leaving the facts behind. People need to get a taste of reality in order to survive in the 'real society' and one of the greatest ways to obtain this knowledge is through books. Being exposed to offensive material and different viewpoints helps shape ourselves into who we are or will become. To take this away would be harming our development and growth, thus creating an 'imperfect' society. Certain points in history are not something that everyone can be proud of. The Civil War, Cambodia's genocide, and societal racial discrimination are all devastating points in time that can be a touchy subject to one and few people. However, history is an important factor in everyones lives; we know history in order to not repeat it. Losing this information is way for people to not be clearly informed, harming the future outcome of our society. Without public records of these happenings, it can cause confusion and misconcepted views of important topics. If we censor all the media from libraries across the nation, ordinary people, such as yourself, would be 'living in the dark.' As people develop their own opinions and views overtime they begin to distinguish the difference between right and wrong. Your rights may be someone else's wrongs. What may be offensive to you, may not be offensive to the person sitting next to you. Quoted by the author Katherine Paterson, '...if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In truth, by removing offensive material from our bookshelves there would be no media left. Not everyone will have the same opinion on matters that hold importance, but that is why the society goes around. We as a society have the right to guard our ability to share opinions, censorship destroys our ability to do so. Everyone is different. The society is full of diversity and viewpoints that are bursting with interesting concepts. By censoring records of history, opinion, observations, our society becomes an illusion. We need to have these facts available to the general public. By ridding ourselves of 'offensive' media we cannot share our opinions with one another for a more successful society. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because it is harmful to our growth as a society and is overall the wrong thing to do.
1186	4163	2	3	There are books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. that are not appropriate for children. Having them banned from shelves shouldn't even be a question; if children shouldn't read, watch, or listen to it then it's the parents' responsibility to make sure they don't. I don't think they should take those kinds of books, movies, or music off the shelves because what about teens that like them or grown ups also. They're just gonna take them down for the children but lose business from grown ups and teens. That doesn't make any sense at all. I think either the child should know what he or she can read, watch, or listen to, and if they can't then it's up to the parent or a grown up around them to let them know what they can choose. A way to solve the problem can be separating those offensive books, music, or movies from ones that are appropriate for children. That would make everything a lot easier so nothing comes off the shelves, and no one loses business because you are still catering to all age groups.
1187	4164	2	3	I go to the libbrary every Tuesday of every week. Although I don't really read that much. I usualy get movies or music. If I do get a book to read its usualy a magazine or something for school. I don't think that books should be removed. If you don't read them it doesent mean that other people don't. If you don't like the book just ignore it and go on its simple as that. For instens if I found a book about POLITICS or about the PRESIDENT fathe I would not read it for my self but I would not take it down off of the shelf. Other people might want to read it. It's there choice to read it not mine. It's like the radio know. The radio plays songs and cuts out the curis words. I don't think that they should do that because it messies up the songs lyrics and it is going aginst the artists words. The artist sings the song but people chang his or her words. To me I don't think thats right. It's also like telivtion now. You see the movie in theaters or on NETFLIX and they have bad language or bad seens in them. When you watch that same movie on telivtion they take out about 20 minuts of the movie because of th bad seen or they cut out the languge. To me I think every thing should stay. I think if you don't want your kids to see it just block it but don't cut out parts from the movie it's not fair to the other people. If people don't like some music then just swich the radio station to another area on the radio. Theres no need to take the words out. Kids are going to pick the words up in school or off the streets any way. I also think seence we are having to pay so much taxes I think we should get the privilage to come home and watch movies on telivtion and relax, without having content altered for some perceived offense.
1188	4165	2	3	It is important to know what is going on or what has gone on in the world. If @CAPS1 is unaware, problems can only be helped to a short extent. There is a point in which words can turn into harrassment, but the boundaries before reaching that point can be fairly defended by the freedom of speech. @CAPS1 must learn in order to teach. @CAPS1 must teach for others to learn. Censorship in libraries is more offensive than the material that is hidden. Censorship should be prohibited because knowledge and time is all we have and everyone must receive and give respect. If @CAPS1 were to look up information about the government on the internet, that person would not find a lot of useful information. It is a challenge to find why same-sex marriage is illegal in some areas or if the words on the news are true. In this generation, our species relies on cellphones, websites with recent dates, and the news. It seems that the time of research is diminishing. @CAPS1 can only learn so much from a world history textbook. It @MONTH1 not be completely accurate; biases and incomplete information can unintentionally be passed down. The passing of the information from historian to historian over the centuries can potentially be described as the game telephone. With such a high risk of being mislead, the world needs as much information and thought as it can get. Knowledge, no matter the content, is valuable. It can help @CAPS1 to learn from mistakes and solve problems. The world cannot afford to censor. Censorship does not change the existence of that censored author's thoughts or the reality of what has occurred. The hidden information could be helpful. As this essay is being read, people are dying. It can easily be counted: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3. They are gone. At any moment, anyone and everyone could die. Time is mainly all we have. We need knowledge to make the most out of it. Everyone deserves to be heard. If @CAPS1 were to refrain from listening when being spoken to, it would be disrespectful and offensive to the speaker. A lot of the people in underdeveloped countries go with their starving cries unheard. Such cries make the more fortunate, well-fed, and housed people such as myself uncomfortable. Despite such discomfort, this information should not be hidden from anyone; acknowledgement is the first step towards change. No matter how uncomfortable or offensive a material @MONTH1 be, perhaps the author is simply thinking for himself/herself. Perhaps the author does not find it offensive, and is simply trying to make sense of the world because that is all @CAPS1 can do with all of the problems that exist. Every single person has the right to be heard. The people that believe something should be censored or hidden could have completely different opinions from others. There is no absolute, divine being that can accurately judge a material. The people that censor could be wrong about the content of the material. Because of the great variety of opinions and concept of respect, everyone must be heard. Censorship should not be allowed because time and knowledge are the valuable building blocks that determine the future of humanity and not a single thought should go unheard. Censorship is a great hindrance to knowing what is occurring and what has occurred in the world. Truth is knowledge and knowledge is truth. It is up to the world to unleash it and make something out of it, for a future built on understanding and progress.
1189	4166	2	3	People will always take things offensively. It is a fact of life. No one will ever be completely satisfied no matter what. We cannot try to please everyone, but it will never happen. We have freedom of speech even if those words are offensive to others. Things on the internet are offensive and no one can mandate how it is viewed either. The same should go for a library. I understand a parent's concern with their child reading or listening to things that are not appropriate. Some of the things authors write can be either inappropriate or offensive. That is their freedom of speech. We cannot take that away from them but there should be some censorship at least to the appearance of books. For music and movies they usually have a warning label if it is not intended for younger kids. It might be a good idea for some libraries to do the same with books and magazines. In order to see a rated, 'R', movie you have to be over 17 and for a good reason because of the mature content. The books being written now are more and more mature. But if we take on the custom of being of certain age for books we might invade the privacy of others. No one has the right to remove books from a library's shelf on the count of being offensive. Who can judge whether something is offensive? The libraries are publicly owned and therefore have no one owner. The city owns them. If there is a problem with whether a book should be at the library it is the city's decision. Even if there is such an uproar about one book, unless the decision is unanimous, no book should be taken off the shelves. The book should simply be put in a spot either behind the counter or where it is available only on request. Taking books off the shelves I believe is taking away from the public's ability to read. If a parent is concerned about what their child might read, they should confront their local librarian. The librarian may be able to help them retrieve books that are appropriate and appealing to their child, providing a solution that respects both parental concerns and the freedom to read.
1190	4167	2	3	There are a lot of things that people think; do we really think that things that are found offensive in libraries should be taken down? I think that if there is something found offensive in a library, it should be taken down immediately. Libraries should be a place of comfort, a place to relax, a place to read and enjoy our books, not a place where if we find something disturbing or offensive, we shouldn't come there anymore. Some people might not care about the things they see, and some do. Therefore, if I see something that offends me and is disturbing to me, I will ask nicely if it could be removed from the list and book files. Now, to sum it all up, if a book or whatever it might be offends you in the library, then I believe it should be removed from that library to ensure it remains a welcoming space for all. If people find things less attractive and offensive, it will soon go around, and fewer people will come to that library. This is how I put it: make the library suitable for others, make them feel at home when they are reading their book, magazine, etc., not just for you. It is how others think about what is out there in these libraries, not what you think, and a library should strive to be a comfortable space for its diverse patrons.
1191	4168	2	3	This is a very difficult topic to argue with. In my opinion I believe that there should be certain types of censorship in the libraries. Eventually everyone is going to be exposed to the type of material in some of these books and etc. This material should be allowed in public libraries and high school libraries, but of course you wouldn't want to see a high school level of maturity in an elementary library. High school students are more than likely to be exposed to inappropriate music and magazines than younger children. If they would like to listen to music that has inappropriate language then they should be allowed to. If there are young kids doing this it is obviously a bad thing because it is teaching them wrong things early in their life. It is even best if they aren't exposed to this at all. There are also certain books in this world that are inappropriate to even high school students and they need to stay out of all libraries so that there is no exposure. Once they are old enough to make their own choices then that is their decision on whether or not they want to look at those books. There are some things that can and can't be put out into libraries, especially materials considered harmful or exploitative. Even you should know what belongs or doesn't. So as I come to my conclusion, there should be things like music, books, and magazines, but leave out the graphic material; children don't need to see that kind of stuff. Ultimately, it is all your own choice of things you want to read. Just make it the right choice, and understand what you're reading, watching, listening to, or being around.
1192	4169	2	3	Teachers in schools do their best to make sure the material that children and young adults read and see in school is appropriate for their certain age group. Parents also make the effort to censor what their kids read, watch, and listen to as a way of keeping them innocent. At a point in a young adults life, this feeling of censorship wears off, and the teenager decides to read, watch, and listen to whatever they want to. This is how it goes in most cases, but is this strong feeling of public censorship too old fashioned for todays society? In my opinion, yes. Censorship, to a certain extent, should not be present in libraries. There will always be something that one person finds inappropriate while another finds it to be perfectly fine. When I was younger we would sometimes watch movies in the after school program I attended. One movie, *The Little Mermaid* specifically, created conflict. While my mother was fine with me watching the movie, some of the other kids were not allowed to because their parents did not find the movie appropriate. Because of this one parent family all the kids in the program had to watch a different movie that everyone's parents were okay with. As Ray Bradbury said eventually 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries restricted material based on what people found offensive, there would be nothing left; people can find offensive material in almost any material in this century. It is the way our culture is. I am not saying it is right, but someone else might think so and that person has a right to go to a library and get a book that they find perfectly fine. In the United States censorship has almost never been present. It is part of what is great about this country. People can speak, believe, and read what they want without the government interfering. This is not true in a lot of places and we should value that as citizens, not complain about it. The government has no right constitutionally to censor material put in public, there can be age restrictions, but to completely cut the material out would go against this countrie's policy of freedom. I agree that age restrictions are okay, but I believe it is ultimately up to the parents of a child what they want their child to watch or read. Overall, the censorship issue is a little bit of a grey area. In my opinion our country is about freedom and censorship is not exactly upholding the constitution. People can believe what they want, but the issue will be hard to conclude. Everyone has a different view on something, that is what started this issue in the first place. When everyone learns to get along, maybe then can this problem be solved.
1193	4170	2	3	Today's books in our libraries are sometimes offensive. Yes, I know they are about things that happen in history. Other books are not, some more than others. They are about killing, shooting, doing drugs, ect. First, I don't want my children growing up thinking it's okay to steal, do drugs, or anything of that sort. I've seen books that have no meaning at all that should be in our libraries. The kids might think they are good books to read, I think otherwise. Books that fourth graders read that have bad words in them.  Secondly, books are fun to read, I know they are. You have to look at it this way I'm of age to read those kind of books but, letting little kids read those books is not okay with me or other people. If it were up to me I would take some of the really bad books, music, movies, and magazines out. It's not up to me, it takes more than one person to do that. It wouldn't be fair if it was all up to me because the person next to me might not think the way I am.  Next, it's okay to take a movie and watch it or even ask for some music to listen to. As long as it's okay to watch or listen to. I'm just saying what I think would be right. Not everyone thinks the same. People let kids watch, and listen to all kinds of music and movies. As long as it's okay with the parent it should be okay, because they know their children best.  Lastly, let kids be kids. Have them grow up the way they want to grow up. Yes, that might sound dumb to the next person but it sounds okay with me. At the end of the day you still get to teach them not to listen or do that kind of stuff in the books. Ultimately, parents should have a say in what their children are exposed to, but respecting diverse viewpoints is crucial for the good of the community.
1194	4171	2	3	Today in our society many things can be taken in many different way. Many sayings, quotes and even just simple words are twisted, turned, and made into something they are not. The author Katherine Paterson once said that a person has a right to remove harmful things that explicit for children from a shelf, and this is true. Even with that being true, the question truly is, will it do you any good to take those things away? In my opinion offensive materials should not be removed because a librarian could be taking away material someone without money wanted, children--espcially teens--will almost do anything for what they want, and things have a double meaning most of the time.  If a librarian finds something offensive, he or she should not ever put that book on the shelf in fear of children finding the material. I think that action the librarian takes is completely unnecessary. He or she may be able to take that privelege away from his or her own library, but the material is still out there in the world. A child can simply go to another library, or even a store to find the same thing. I also believe that a library should leave the book on the shelf because what if an adult wants to read the book but does not have the opportunity to read it because it is found offensive.  Being a teenager myself, I have seen what lengths some people will go to just so they can get this explicit material. If a teen goes to a library and can not find what they want at that location, they will simply move on to another location. In even the most extreme cases, a teen will take their parent's credit card and purchase the item they desire online. In this case it would seem as if the library not having one thing because of something offensive, could cause a big catastrophe.  When a person listens to music, or reads a book, that person could take something differently from how the writer intended it to be. For example a person could take up a funny book that is finding funny things in everyone, but the reader could end up thinking the author was only making fun of one specific thing; something that reader could be involved in. Most songs nowadays have an excessive use of fowl language, but even then that language is not intended to be taken in the way some people take it. Everything in life can have a double meaning, which makes it easier to find offensive material.  These select few reasons are why censorship in libraries is unesscesary. The responsibility should not be put on the librarians, but on the parents if a librarian is concerned about a child finding unacceptable material. If the librarian does not like the material then he or she should not listen to or read it; however, that librarian should not take the privelege to listen to or read the material from other people. Katherine Paterson once said you can hope for a child not to find the material, and you can take it away, but then there is nothing left for the rest of the people. With this it shows that a person can not let one small thing ruin something for everyone else.
1195	4172	2	3	The idea of censoring books and music in our libraries has long been debated. Libraries are places that people can go to stray away from the norm and get lost in the works of other authors and musicians. I believe that reading and the ability to express oneself through the powers of music is a very essential part of our lives. Censoring these would only shelter our lives and keep younger generations from discovering the effect that words have on our emotions and actions from day to day. Books are one of the oldest forms of information we've had throughout the years. I think that if someone were to remove a piece of information that they found offensive it would only open the door to other people to find excuses to keep the hard work of authors behind closed doors. Personally i enjoy reading. I think that with every book i read it opens the door to other beliefs and culturs that i would otherwise never learn about. Children need to be able to explore the world, to get to know how other civilizations grow and function as to how we in the United States function in our own little world that is getting more and more judgemental every day. The only way to do this is to pick up a book from someone who has been lucky enough to experience it themselves. I have always had a deep passion for music. When i want to relax music helps me to center myself and open my mind. In my opinion, censoring music shouldn't be something that people even consider. Removing music from libraries is difficult for me to even begin to try and accept. Freedom of speech was once a huge part of our country. Now it seems as if everything we've been taught of our great nation has been nothing more than just a false cover to let the government control how we live, act, and now how we choose to express ourselves. Music is a freeing way to express oneself in a not so violent way. During the sixties and seventies, music was the way alot of people protested things like war and racism without being violent. Times have changed though and the people in charge of our country no longer see it as an 'appropriate' option. I belive that just because one society believes something to be inappropriate, doesn't mean that it actually is that way. We worry enough already about what other people think, why try to judge others' work if we can't accept the fact that we are all different. If we all accepted the differences in our world's cultures, there wouldn't have to be a debate on whether or not to censor an expressive and emotional piece of art that deserves to be shown in our libraries.
1196	4173	2	3	Can you believe that some people think that books should be banned for having bad things in them? Well I can, Children today are learning nothing but violence and cursing these days. Banned books could be the way we set them strait and make them recognise that stuff is bad. Only a handfull of kids these days are choosing to read books, a majority of them are playing video games and watching tv. Chilren shouldn't be alloud to swear, or think that violence is alright. Chilren will read these bad books and think it is ok to shoot someone if they are doing something they don't like, but it's not alright. Banned books are exaclty what children need when they are in their younger years. Banned books might have foul language and violence, but I believe that it is ok to let your teen or young adault read them if they are mature enough to handle it. Teenagers should be mature enough to be able to read a book with a few swear words in it, or someone killing another person. Some banned books don't even have swear words in them; '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' doesn't have one swear word in any of the books but still it remains on the banned books list to this day. Some books, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed for profanity and drugs because impressionable minds should be protected. I do believe that someone is trying to make a difference with the banned books list. Censorship should only be used if a person is too young to understand why or what is happening when they say a bad word or do something confusing. In conclusion I think censorship is a great thing that should be used moderatly and judiciously. The children today dont need to be learning about sex, drugs, swearing, violence, etc. I do believe if they put an age limit on what you can watch/read that it will be a more controlled topic to talk about, ensuring a more guided and appropriate learning experience.
1197	4174	2	3	I feel that censorship in libraries is not needed. There are ways around your child having to be subjected to certain things you don't want them to be subjected to. If you don't want your child to witness certain types of material that is on you, not the libraries. We have libraries for the sole purpose of variety what is the point in having a library if you can't find what you want because it has offended someone. There are ways around completely taking certain things off the shelf if they are that explicet then they can be put in a section just for adults. No I do not belive certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. One reason why it is not necessary to take certain things off the shelf is if you don't want your child to read or see certain things okay that's fine then watch them and see what they try to pick up and read or watch. Your child doesn't have to anything if you don't want them to. It's like saying I don't like this telivision show I never want my child to see it well what are the odds that telivision show is going to stop playing just becase your not happy with the violents,drug use,language, ect. The odds are extremely unlikely. When you don't want you child to see that certain show what do you do you watch them and keep them from watrching it so why should there be any differance when it comes to the books they are subjected to in a library. Another reason would be the sole purpose of a libray is to give variety to the people a place where there is something for everyone. Just because you think something is horrible and no one should read, hear, or see doesn't mean that some one else won't like it, it could be someone else's favorite book,magazine,cd, or movie. One oppinion shouldn't count for so much. If you don't like a book,movie,magazine, cd or agree with the content fine your entitled to your own oppinion then don't check it out no one is making you. If they took something off the self everytime they got a complaint about it there would be nothing left. If they were about to try and accomidate everyone they might as well just give up and close all libraries down all around the world because there will be nothing left on the selves. Also instead of taking them completly off the shelf if they are that explicet maybe make an eightteen and older section. It would solve a lot of problems. Yes I agree that there are a select few books,magazines,movies,ect. that younger people should not be subjected to, but as and adult you should be able to read,watch,and hear whatever you want, which is a fundamental freedom. That right shouldn't be taken away just because there are children that come to libraries. Every library I have ever been to there are certain sections and if your child stays in the section where there type of books are then they should be fine. Aside from that though an eightteen and older section would solve a lot of conflict. No I do not belive certain material should be taken off the selves if they are found offensive. There are way to many ways around having to take the books completely off the selves. I don't want to go to a library one day and there be literally nothing left because they took a book off the self every time someone had a problem with it. There is absolutly no reason why we can't figure spomething out to make everyone happy and I think that having the eightteen and older section would be a good start. For the whole i don't want my child to be sujected to those kinds of things then keep your child away for those kinds of things nobody is forcing them to read anything you don't want them to, allowing for a balance between freedom of access and parental responsibility.
1198	4175	2	3	Libraries in @LOCATION1 are many libraries throughout the @LOCATION1 that stock their shelves with materials such as books, magazines, music and movies. Libraries do have a purpose I must say, having a library gives out the information that you can't find elsewhere. Just think libraries a huge variety of everything you might need all in one place. Certain materials such as magazines and movies that are rated @CAPS2 for instance, should be placed elsewhere on the shelves immediately. If you'd like to rent them you must ask for assistance, and go from there. Children of all ages step foot in your library and are bound to come across unneccessary information. In my own perspective libraries should be an adult section, where only adults above a certain age should be aloud in or be able to check out. By keeping such materials shown or on display, it can cause children to engage in dangerous or unsafe actions. As for music, it can go both ways. Music is more of a lifestyle, some people can't live without it. Adults in this day and age 'need music to survive' is what they commonly say. If your library decides to take these materials off the shelf, people will be turned away and your library will lose buisness. What is a library if you don't have music, books, magazines and movies? An empty room. Certain materials that are not appropriate for people of all ages should be placed high up, or in their own area where not everyone is aloud at. Taking away such materials will cause alot of grief. Just reorganize and make libraries enviornmentally safe so everyone is welcomed and there will be no complications, ultimately striking a balance that respects both the library's mission and the community's diverse needs.
1199	4176	2	3	
1200	4177	2	3	When it comes to the decision of certain materials being allowed in the library, there are many different aspects that must be considered. There isn't a particular audience that visits a library. Many types of people go to libraries looking for different things. Blocking types of materials will lose an audience's interest and they will go elsewhere. Now that doesn't mean that offensive materials are acceptable, and here is why. There should be a level of intensity in which the item is offensive. Profanity and action are minor types of offense. However, intense violence and explicit materials such as blood and such need to have conditions. Categorization is an acceptable method to blocking some children from viewing harmful materials. Putting violent books in an area that is blocked to children under the age of 16 is an effective way to restrict children. Adults would not want to go into this section and therefore wouldn't be an issue. It is understandable that some people are offended by the materials showcased in libraries because a library is a place for everyone. If offensive items were available only to those who wanted it and hidden from the public, then this is something that could solve the problem. Many individuals should realize that a library isn't a place for one type of person and must be shared by all types. When it comes to books they can be placed in areas available to people who enjoy it. The same applies for magazines and movies. Movies are a form of entertainment that is strongly advertised over magazines and books. Any advertisement that shows explicit material or offensive pictures or text should be removed from the view of the public. These advertisements should be only viewable by the audience it was intended for. If children wish to use computers there are rules that need to be applied as well. Children under the age of 16 should have safety precautions that block them from using the computer to look up harmful material, children over the age of 16 know how to avoid certain material and proceed at their own risk. These computers should be separated to avoid peeking eyes from children or anyone who finds the material to be appalling. Listening to music on the computer or by a device should require a couple of things as well. If there is a song that isn't preferable to a certain audience or it offends someone headphones should be a requirement. The library is a place for peace and quiet so headphones are necessary regardless. This can potentially eliminate the problem as long as the headphones themselves are at an appropriate level. If children want to check out any materials that is or can be offensive or explicit in some way they must prove their age of maturity, due to some items with slight violence being available to children under the age of 16. In conclusion, if the categorization of harmful or explicit materials is placed properly and out of view of unwanted viewers or children this can eliminate the issue. Music is to be played through headphones only and must be at an appropriate volume. No items should not be removed from shelves if they offend people but conditions should be enforced. With rules and conditions, the library can be a safe and enjoyable place for everyone.
1201	4178	2	3	I think that the music and other things besides books should stay in the library. Honestly that's where a lot of people go and find other music, yes it could be offensive to some people, but to others it's not. They have the right to say they don't want to listen to that stuff, so they don't have to. The library holds over a 100 different kinds of music, movies, magazines, etc. So if there's over that many, then why should other people be limited to what they read, hear, and look at? The library is where people go to find new things and explore what other people find interesting. Why would they put it in there just to take it all away. I remember going to the library as a young child and looking around me, I saw all these other people look at things I have never even heard of, granted I was only 6, but my point is that, people grow into what they like, they aren't just born liking something and that's it.  I think the library is perfect just the way it is. I think that if anything we should put more different kinds of music. I know not everybody likes the same music, so why would you want to force them to? I think that the LIBRARY.S is populating more and more everyday, that all we can do is just extend it in every way possible.  Keeping in mind that not everybody likes to read books, they just find reading magazines and watching movies interesting. I know I'm a person that would much rather watch a movie, or listen to music than read a book. Not everybody is the same, so why would you want to treat them that way.  Being 18, and if I had to listen to Disney tracks all the time, I think I would drive myself crazy. I listen to the things I listen to because I have interest in them, if somebody took away my music away I wouldn't know what to do with myself. I guess I would just have to read the books I don't like, and listen to the music I can't stand.  The music should stay in the libraries because that's where it belongs; you can't make everybody happy, but you can provide a diverse range of options so that everyone has the opportunity to find something that resonates with them.
1202	4179	2	3	In my opinion, I do believe we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves. These materials might not be offensive to some people, but it can be to others. They can be against some peoples religion and way of life. I have read some books outside of my school library that I think should not be found on a library shelf. Now they are putting those same books in libraries. These books have violence and inappropriate behavior in them. Are these books you want your children to be reading?  There are even movies that are like those books. Many shows are based of a book series, and that series might not be a good one. The series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers. The kids could see something they think is really neat on the screen and then go out and try that. They do not understand that what they do might not be a good thing. They could get into a lot more trouble then they want to get in.  I know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all. In my opinion, the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them. After that, the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch them.  There are some that would agree with my opinion and some that would not. What do you think? Do you want your children watching or reading something bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way? Would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good? Or do you want them to know what they should and should not do? Ultimately, it's about protecting children and guiding them towards responsible decision-making.
1203	4180	2	3	I believe that many books in our local libraries this month come off as crude or offensive to many readers, but I also believe it has a lot to do with the maturity level of some people. For instance, if you are an adult you will most likely be looking in the adult section. There may be children who look through that same section, although their parents should be monitoring what they are checking out at their local libraries. Although maturity has a lot to do with it, some young adult books probably aren't intended for the people reading them. Some young adult books may be venturing too far, and the children who are reading these books probably shouldn't be. I don't think that everyone should have access to check out whatever they want whenever they want. Many parents have different rules for their children then others, and they may not agree with what is displayed among these shelves for their child to checkout. I remember times when I was a little my parents didn't always let me check out what I wanted, because I was too young to be viewing it in the first place.  As for adults, they are free to make their own choices on what to checkout. I don't think the adult section at the libraries should be monitored all that much, because as an adult you are free to make your own decisions. You know whats right and whats wrong, and no one person should have to tell you what you should or shouldn't be reading.  The area that I would be most concerned with would be the young adult section. At that point children are at an awkward growing stage were they themselves are still learning whats right and wrong. Some books or movies could effect the young viewers dramatically. Their parents may be letting them watch horrific movies, and it could make them feel as if what they're watching is really okay. I think parents should be very involved in their children's lives, and closely monitor what their children are reading or watching.  I do feel that some books should be monitored, and taken off the shelves if they are found inappropriate for the intended age. Mostly in the children and young adult sections, because they could be taking in information they shouldn't be. I also feel that parents should take a part in their childs life, and set limits to what their child is aloud viewing. Above all, I think that everyone should check out books in their appropriate age section, and that a balance between parental guidance and age-appropriate content is crucial for responsible reading habits.
1204	4181	2	3	"Yes, I believe certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from library shelves if they are offensive in any way. Librarians shouldn't have ""bad stuff"" on the shelves if it is offensive to some people. Libraries should only have interesting books with good stories to read and kid's books. There should be no sexual or racial books, movies, magazines, etc. Those things that are found offensive should be taken off the shelf because there are little kids that go to the library, and they shouldn't be able to see those things or check them out. I do agree that libraries should have a wide range of different kinds of books and movies, etc., because everybody has their own taste in what they like, but the things that are offensive shouldn't be on the shelves. If libraries didn't have offensive things on the shelf, then nobody would have to see them or have arguments about them. It would be so much easier because it wouldn't cause any problems with people because they wouldn't be on the shelf. So, if they would just take those things off the shelf, then nobody would see them, and there would be no problems at the libraries. Adults and kids could go to the library and pick out what they wanted without seeing the offensive things on the shelves, which would make it a much better place to enjoy, ultimately creating a more comfortable and welcoming environment for everyone."
1205	4182	2	3	When you want to read that one special book you heard about but find out it was considered offensive to some, what would you do? Public libraries that remove all offensive material from shelves prevent anyone from reading it. Then that one special book you wanted to read is now off limits. A book someone worked hard on, or a song or movie, is now stored away because of a little controversy. Do you find that to be fair to our rights? I find the fact of censorship a very confusing topic in public libraries. If someone is to write and publish a book, then someone will want to read it. If some find it offensive, then no one can read it; how is that fair to the people who do enjoy it? The way it should be done is if you don't like it, don't read it; don't just take it away from all who would want to read it. There are some materials in libraries I think should be censored to a certain degree. Such as anything with nudity or adult content. That doesn't mean, though, it should be taken away. The stuff with this content should not be taken away but in a selected area for only adults to view. Many movie stores and book stores have the same idea, so why doesn't the library just adopt that idea? We as individuals have the right to freely state our opinions and what we believe. If someone wants to write a book on what they think is right, then they are allowed to do that. If you censor something just because you don't like what they say that is a violation of the constitution. You are allowed to express your opinion about it, but taking it away because you do not like it is wrong to do. Do you find it fair that people spend so much money and time in writing a book and a few people find it offensive, so no one can view it anymore? I say if someone spends their time and effort, then it should be allowed for those who do enjoy it. Is it really so hard for you not to pick up a book that you do not find offensive? Censorship is good in some cases, but enforcing it too much on what someone calls offensive is against our right to freedom of expression, and a balance must be struck to ensure both access to diverse materials and sensitivity to community concerns.
1206	4183	2	3	Should offensive material be censored? Removing things such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that are found offensive could be both good and bad. It could be good because younger children wouldn't be exposed to things that are considered offensive. Although, it could be bad because it takes away from freedom of choice. Most young children don't know good from bad, so censoring these things for them could be good. Though, you shouldn't want to shelter your children from the real world. Protecting your children from things that offend you might stop them from growing up badly. Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there.  Censoring or removing things that you find offensive might be a good idea. There are plenty of reasons someone might want to do this. A parent might not want their child to read, hear, or see something simply because it offends them. Another reason parents might want to censor these things is just because they don't want their child exposed to it. Parents know that most young children don't know right from wrong, so they'd like to make that choice for them. By doing this, a parent knows what their child is reading, hearing, or seeing. Some parents might feel that they need to protect their children from these things because it could be harmful to them. They also might feel this should be done so their child doesn't grow up badly.  Removing offensive material from shelves would take away from a person's freedom of choice. Who wants to be told what they can and cannot read? If a parent does this to their child, it just sheltering them from the world around them. A child should be able to know the life around them before they grow up and are completely lost. Parents might think that this is a good idea because it protects their children from things that might be considered bad. When really, protecting them could be harmful. Censoring books, movies, music, etc., won't stop what is already bought and out in our world. Offensive music, movies, books, etc., have already been bought and sold for years.  I feel that censoring or removing books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be done. It doesn't give people a choice. Some people might like reading graphic novels or things like that. Music is made for the enjoyment of the people. Some people like their music to talk about drugs or curse, why take that away from them? It just wouldn't be fair to take a choice away from someone. A movie is just a movie, it's not real. Just because something is done in a movie doesn't mean that a person will go off and do it. I think people should be able to have a choice.  Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there. If people stopped to think about it, they would realize that offensive material has already been bought by others. Plenty of people have illegally downloaded, or bought music that uses inappropriate language. This music is already in their iPods, MP3's, and burned onto CDs, there's no removing it. Books that some might find offensive have already been printed and sold to others. One person might lend that book to another, therefore the offensive book is being spread around. Plenty of movies that involve adult content, violence, and drugs have been released into the media. Lots of people own these kinds of movies. So, why censor things now, when there's already unremovable offensive material out? Ultimately, the focus should be on individual choice and responsibility rather than broad censorship, as it is impossible to completely erase offensive material that already exists.
1207	4184	2	3	The many books, movies, music, and magazines in the world could be offensive. In all of these examples there could be bad language, pictures, and messages. No matter where people go they can find something that could offend someone. No matter what, people will try and get rid of eveything bad but the truth is they are gonna be around forever if not a very long time. In @CAPS1 @CAPS2 all the students in grade ten just got done reading '@CAPS3 of @CAPS4 @CAPS5.' The story is about a runaway @NUM1er named @CAPS6; and a runaway boy named @CAPS7. Many libraries have banned this book because of the use of the n-word. '@CAPS3 of @CAPS4 @CAPS5' has profanity in it, and people don't want that book to be taught in @CAPS2. I personally think it should be taught, because it shows students today what it was like back when there was slavery. Music is something that mostly everyone listens to. Songs always have a meaning or a subject the artist sings or raps about. Many song artists write about love, money, and fame, yet others write about drugs, profanity, and suicide. Hip-hop, rap, country, rock, metal, jazz, r&b, punk, ect., are only a few of the hundreds of types of music out there; and at least @NUM2 songs of each type have a bad meaning behind it. Magazines and movies are the same way. Magazines and movies have everything between cars to bad pictures in them and historical places, facts, and documents to action. Even though there are age limits to buy or see stuff it still doesnt mean that it couldent get into a teens hands. Because there is bad language in music, movies, books, etc., doesnt mean it should be banned, just limmited. No, it is not wrong to put what you feel into a book or into a movie just make sure it is analized right so it can only be checked out or sold to the people of the right age. What the children and teens are into now will affect the world in a later time and keep on going untill there is a change made. Therefore, while acknowledging the potential for offensive content, a balanced approach of informed analysis and age-appropriate limitations, rather than outright bans, is crucial to ensuring that young people can engage with diverse perspectives and ideas responsibly, shaping a more thoughtful and understanding future.
1208	4185	2	3	We live in a world today inundated and persuaded by media. Ever since we were little, our young minds have been filled with opinions of others from history and from the present. Whether we are reading a book, watching a motion picture, or even listening to a new music artist, our lives are being affected by such media. The art world is considered to be one of the most controversial businesses to work in. Each piece of literature or movie is shared by a vast community of critics. We all are given the right to our opinion on such pieces. Every piece of art is judged and then criticized. However, many find certain pieces to be offending in some way, shape, or form. It is quite impossible to produce such a piece that will fit everybody's satisfaction. For an example, religious pieces are often scorned for their nonfactual information or for the director's or author's opinion over the matter. Since we live in such a diverse community of religions, these pieces will never satisfy the audience. Movies have been criticized for decades because they represent some sort of life lesson or truth that is not appealing to the audience. Why not learn from them and reflect? No piece of media can possibly be directed to satisfy the opinions of all the world. As a personal example, I can see that novels and books over war are heavily criticized. The men and women who fought for our country often enjoy to see such pieces written about them, but war protesters and peace keepers often see this as an insult to their cause. Ray Bradbury wrote a book by the name Fahrenheit 451. This book was heavily criticized over the topic of censorship. The world in which they lived in had dramatically been affected by the impact of peoples opinions. If a book or movie was offensive to a group of people, then they burned the books. History books about slavery and war were burned because others found the topics offending. Non-religious groups thought that religion was offensive, so they burned the Bible and other works of religion. Their government wanted a world of peace and a community where every man was equal and diversity was no longer existent. Bradbury denies the book was written over censorship but his book gives our generation a great lesson. For generations, we have grown up in a world of diversity. Every mind is special and different and will never share identical thoughts as his neighbor. Therefore, we must recognize that we have to survive and live together. We can not escape the diversity in which we live in. The books we see on shelves, the movies we see on the big screen, and music we listen through our earphones all make up our generations history and the next. We need to accept our neighbor and his opinions because we are all born equal. If we throw away our history and our accomplishments, man is left nothing to improve on, nothing to leave his or her marking on history. We have to accept others ideas and build on them to improve our life and other's. As we stand today in a world filled with diversity, we must move on and reflect, understanding that it is not a time to offend and be offended but a time to learn and move on, so we can foster a more tolerant and progressive society for all.
1209	4186	2	3	I am writing to propose my views on censorship in libraries. During a recent visit, I encountered some materials that I found overwhelming and offensive. I believe such content should be censored and removed from the shelves. As a place of business, a library should not display materials that might disgust its customers. I hope to convey my reasoning effectively.  I have strong reasons for wanting offensive material removed, based on my own experience. Certain books, music, and magazines were offensive to me. I believe such matters should be handled responsibly, and I am trying to advocate for myself and others in the community.  Imagine a visitor picking up a magazine with insulting visual content that relates to their own experiences. If that content is presented negatively, it could be deeply offensive. People visit libraries for various reasons, certainly not to be insulted. It is inappropriate for libraries to contain offensive materials.  People come to libraries for different reasons, some to escape, others as part of their routine. Regardless, they should feel comfortable. Why would you want to make members of the community feel uncomfortable? If they are, they will tell others, and the library could lose patrons. It's important to consider the impact of your decisions and how you present things to the public.  In response to the question, I strongly agree that offensive materials should be removed from library shelves. I believe in promoting happiness. Too much judgment and negativity are prevalent in society today. If people refrained from judging and insulting others, the world would be a safer place. This change has to start somewhere, and removing offensive material from libraries would be a positive step towards a happier, more inclusive world, bringing us closer together. I hope my explanation will assist in making this decision.
1210	4187	2	3	CENSORSHIP @CAPS1: @CAPS2 paper Do I believe the certain materials, such a book,music,movies,magazines,ect., should be removed from the shelves if the are found offensive. My opinion is that if someone wants to write a magazine or a book, it is okay because they are giving their opinion. I know some people just have to say what they believe and some to fight for what they want, not just censorship, as there fight every one has one.  Some materials like music,movies and magazines need to be censor because the kids how go to the libraries kids who are like @NUM1 @NUM2 grade or maybe smaller then that. We need to clean the libraries from thigs the kids are not old enough to see or to hear. Libraries are a place to study and to read a good book or maybe a magazine; we have to censor the bad language and the bad pictures. This can be very offensive for some parents because the @MONTH1 talk about the color of another person or a bad language to offend the government.  People don't have the actittud to stop with this bad songs how contain censorship see somepeople who write this they say the peolpe don't have the actittud to be or say what they want, I think the we need people like that to just point fingers and say that's the bad guy but enswer this what good have you done to clean the libraies.  Censorship is just a small fight about removeding bad contains from the shelves this is just a call make your city a good place to live help the libraries help today change you future tomorrow make a differens. It's a collective responsibility to ensure libraries offer a safe and enriching environment for everyone, especially young children, while also respecting diverse perspectives and opinions.
1211	4188	2	3	"I do believe that certain materials should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive. I think children should only be able to read certain books because some books say things children shouldn't know until they get older. Some books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed if offensive. I think they shouldn't make some kids' movies, books, or music like that for little kids. They put too many things they shouldn't in kids' movies. The movie ""@CAPS1,"" they should not let kids watch that movie; it's not a movie I would let my kids see until they were older. The reason why is because it has a lot of bad language in it. It is about these guys who take roofies. This guy cheats on his girlfriend, and it is just not a movie that I would let my kids watch. There are people getting drunk in the movie. They do stupid things. They try to make it look like it's a good thing to do and that it is so fun to do all those things. I just think that is not a movie to let kids watch. Some music has too much bad language in it. I think they should make better songs for kids. Songs that really mean something or are about someone. Most of these songs they sing now are about dumb things that do not mean anything. I think some magazines are okay to read, but some just talk about actors. Like @PERSON1, I read one time about her doing something that was bad, and she should not be doing that. I think it depends on what the magazine is and what it talks about in it. I believe that if they are offensive they should be taken off the shelves. I also think that if they are not offensive and do not talk about bad things, kids should be able to see them or read them. If they did that kids would not talk and do things like they do today. That kids would not try to steal and things like they do in these movies; they see it happen or their friends do it. So they think it is cool for them to go out and do things like that, but it is not, and restricting access to offensive content could really help improve kids' behavior."
1212	4189	2	3	Offensive material like that should most definitely be removed from the shelf. What if a child finds it? They might think it's the coolest thing they've ever seen. Children shouldn't be able to access this kind of material at all, especially from a place like a library. Somebody could easily pick it off the shelf not knowing what it is. They might start reading it and not know what they're getting into, but it wouldn't be the library's fault, just theirs for picking it up. This kind of material should only be placed where it is welcome, not in libraries or public places like that. If the material was at a type of bookstore that was not meant for people under 18 to go to, then yeah, it is meant to be on the shelf because children aren't allowed in that building; therefore, they cannot see it unless it was brought out of the store to a household or something. Depending on where you go, if that material is on the shelf, say at a place that is not so public, and you pick it up and start reading or watching it, you have yourself to blame for not researching the book or case of the material beforehand. If people want to get it, they can, but it would be at their own risk, so if the consumer takes it off the shelf, it's their risk of being offended; they cannot blame the place where the material was located.
1213	4190	2	3	@CAPS1 us? @CAPS1 now? Those questions just might be flashing through your head right now. The reason @CAPS1 I am writing to you today is to give you my point of view on the censorship in the worlds libraries today. In this context hopefully I will be able to enlighten you on the subject, also with the questions of '@CAPS1 us?', and '@CAPS1 now?'. Censorship, what does that mean to you? To me that means censoring many things in the world to protect it from children who are under the age, not people who are old enough to handle inapropiate things. In todays libraries there are many uncensored things, that happen to be in the adult section of the libraries. Things such as books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the adult section, also labeled as the uncensored section, if that is where they rightfully belong. Now you are probably wondering, @CAPS1 us. In today's world many people want to protect their children from harmful things, such as uncensored materials. @CAPS1 us? In the world today there are so many laws, regulations, and even authorities protecting our rights. Now many people want to try to get around the government protecting our rights. Many want to protect their youth from some of the so called 'harmful' things in society. Today you can try to create a law or bill that @MONTH1 make it through the government, now some of them are trying to remove the uncensored material. @CAPS1 now? Throught the years the world has changed, everything has become easier to have access to. Now one thing they think they @MONTH1 be able to do is remove the adult section of the libraries if enough people stand to fight for it, it will not happen. There is an adult section for adults not children, people need to realize that. In the end, the adult section needs to stay in our libraries. Some of the material in the section is not always bad, sometimes it contains material over war, and recessions. When people are of age they are allowed to enter the areas, not any younger. Don't punish the rest of the world for one libraries mistake of letting children have access to adult material, make the children realize it wasn't their area to be in. Then many parents @MONTH1 see it's not just some of the world, that the whole world is exactly the same way. The books, music, magazines, and etc., need to stay where they are, allowing adults to access information and perspectives relevant to their lives and experiences.
1214	4191	2	3	I think all books and other stuff should stay on the shelves. Because other people should have the right to learn about something if you have already learned it, preserving access to information. Censorship is kind of out of the way, limiting what others can access. I think it really doesn't matter if they see it now or later because they are still going to see it and learn about it later on in life, so restricting access is pointless. If someone wants to read it, I think they have a right to because it is their own choice, respecting individual autonomy. I have been observing students and adults in the libraries and everywhere they think they can run everything, but limiting access infringes on the rights of others. But this is what I think is right, ensuring freedom of choice and access to information for everyone.
1215	4192	2	3	I believe books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. should be removed from the library if they are offensive. Some people take things wrong and libraries could have issues. Also, it keeps customers happy and it will get you more guests daily. Lastly, it might let someone feel better about themselves.  First, some people will take things wrong and libraries will have issues. If someone comes into the library and feels something in the library is offensive, you can get a lawsuit. Also, it could set off anyone's mind to feel disrespected and feel they don't have to respect the library because the library isn't respecting them. It can cause pain in someone's eyes by making them feel like they aren't equal around other people. Essentially, maintaining a collection free of potentially offensive material can prevent legal and social problems.  Second, it keeps customers happy. If a customer feels that they see something offensive and the library discards of the object it will make them feel that you respect them. If you keep offensive things in a library less people will come to the library if they feel they are offended and have no say in if it should be removed. The more people feel home bound the more they will come. Creating a welcoming environment increases library usage.  Next, it might let someone feel better. If you walked into the library and seen something you didn't like in there you would want it removed too. If it didn't get removed you would feel that you are not respected and you will feel not wanted. Let's say someone sees something offensive and the library doesn't remove it and the person took a book out the library, then never returned it you would lose money because you would have to get new books in stock. In this case, the presence of offensive material can directly impact library resources.  In conclusion, there are many ways to resolve problems and resolve issues without conflict. You can disrespect someone and they might disrespect you back, but when it all comes down to it you have to give respect to get it. Some things help people feel better about themselves and keep their day going. So before you make your decision think would you want it done to you, prioritizing community sensitivity and well-being.
1216	4193	2	3	Of course not, there supprisingly still is such a thing called freedom of speech in this country. Just because some people find something offensive does not mean that the so called offensive material does not have the right to be published or shared with anybody. Think of some authors that wrote books like Mark Twain, although there were alot of racist remarks in literature of that time period. That does not mean that they still are not a part of american history. What would taking these types of books off the shelves accomplish? Absoulutely nothing is what, racist people arent going to go hey since all these racist books are gone im just going to except everyone now. Music and movies are forms of expression aswell, and if someone wants to get out of hand write something offensive so be it. You do not have to listen the songs or watch these movies. Nobody can force you to do anything of that nature. People just take everything so literally these days, they got to have their part in anything and everything. When they should reallize that most problems like these do not even pertain to them at all. That they should just focus on their lives and not worry about everything they hear in the news. Therefore, censorship of potentially offensive material does nothing to address the underlying issues and only serves to stifle free expression, and it's crucial to remember that personal offense does not justify limiting access to diverse perspectives.
1217	4194	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a topic that is argued back and forth in today's society. It is something that we all should think about and voice our opinions about. I believe that items in a library should not be censored based on constitutional rights, the creation of gray areas, and the depletion of classic literature.  The First Amendment to the Constitution, clearly outlines the idea of freedom of the press. Not only does this give publishers the right to print whatever they please, but it also gives people a right to choose for themselves what they can and want to read. Censoring books in a library would be denying this right that is clearly spelled out in the Constitution of the United States. I refuse to support any idea that directly opposes the Constitution and the people of the United States should be appalled that this sort of thing is even in discussion.  When it comes to censoring something based on how offensive something is, one always has to consider the gray areas that will be formed. For instance, what is offensive in one book may not be offensive to someone else who would benefit from reading it. The term 'offensive' is a relative one, in that the definition varies from person to person. No one thing can be deemed offensive by one hundred percent of the population and therefore no one thing can be removed without opposition. This creates areas of gray where there is no right answer. This would be extremely problematic for those trying to censor items within a library. Secondly, the decision on who would get to decide what is and is not offensive would cause as much controversy as the books themselves. Knowing that every person carries a different opinion the people deciding would have to equally represent every person’s opinion when making a decision, talk about problematic.  Finally, censoring books would eliminate classic literature and would deplete an understanding of the world through the eyes of great writers. For example, in Mark Twain's 'Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' the 'n' word appears over one hundred times. Many modern readers take great offense at the use of this word. However, this book is seen as one of the centuries greatest works and cannot be removed from the education of young people because of an offensive term. If people want to censor books, then censor them from their own children and not the children of others and inevitably an entire population.  In conclusion, the censorship of literature and other items in a library is not only impossible, but utterly unconstitutional. The idea of censoring items from children based on offense is not something that should be pursued, and we must ensure that libraries remain a haven for diverse perspectives and intellectual exploration.
1218	4195	2	3	There are many forms of entertainment in the world today. Almost anyone has access to movies, magazines, newspapers, music, books, television and radio. While these examples may seem relatively innocent, there are many cases where they can be found very offensive. When the book, magazine or movie was created, it might not have been made to be offensive. A group of people may find something very offensive that most other people wouldn't even think about. There are many types of consumers and it is hard not to offend anyone due to the wide variety of people. Certain materials, such as books, music, movies or magazines should not be removed from the shelves, even if they are found offensive.  The act of censorship in libraries, or anywhere, should be looked down upon. No one is being forced to read a book or magazine, watch a movie or listen to music. If someone finds a book offensive, then the solution is simple: don't read it. Others may find the book to be inspirational and uplifting, and taking the option of reading it away from the person is wrong. There are many forms of entertainment that could be taken the wrong way and be offensive to people. To take away any book or magazine that could be offensive to any group of people would be a large task. Taking away all offensive books would do away with a large portion of books available in libraries. If a person doesn't want to read a book because of the offensive nature of the book, then he can leave it on the shelf and pick a different book. The book should not be taken away from other people just because someone may be offended by it.  Everyone has a different view on things. Many people may think one way about something, while other people think of it completely different. This is why all different forms of books, magazines, radio and music could be offensive to people. For example, a person may be offended if a book talks about a certain topic while another person thinks nothing of it and reads on. This person may enjoy the book and pass it on for others to enjoy. If it was taken off the shelves because it offended the first person, no one would have the option of enjoying it. Just because something is offensive to one person, does not mean it is offensive to everyone.  I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong. There are many personal reasons why someone may be offended by something, but that doesnt mean it should be taken away from the general public. People may miss out of a very good book or movie if it is removed from the shelves due to someone being offended by it. If a person finds a book, for example, to be offensive, they can easily stop reading the book and pick another one. No one is forcing them to read something they don't want to. Also, the book might be very enlightening to another person, and removing it completely would be unfair to them. Censoring the content in libraries is wrong, and we should let individuals decide what they want to consume without imposing our own sensitivities on them.

1220	4197	2	3	I don't think they should be removed because books tell you what it is about in the back. Movies tell you what it is rated. It is mom's or dad's fault. They are the one how allow us to read it, watch it, listen to it, or even play it. if they don't want us learn it then they should't even get for us and the reason they get it for us is because kids are spollied. they want every little thing in the world and the parants are buying it for them to make them happy.  The parants are not the only ones to blame. The kids are to blame to. They are the ones how want to go the rated PG-13 movies or get a rated M video games that have offensive language. kids also say offensive language to each other and suspect them to know what it means. The kids that heard the bad word will go to there parants and say 'what those that word mean'. It happen to me and I said those words to my parants.  When I fist read, heard, and watched it and told my parants what it means I got hit for saying that word. I thought to my self that they want to hear that from me. I was mad that i ever said that word I wished I can go back in time and never say that to my parants that. I don't know why I kept on saying it over and over. i just couldn't get it out of my head. I got in trouble by saying it just because I heard that stupid word that i wished never heard.  I heard it so many times I couldn't get out of my head it is like they knew what it ment but I knew they didn't know because they just said it randomly and I was preaty sure they didn't tell there parants because the one how told there parants got hit still woundering what it ment still having the red mark in there face thinking what they did wrong to deserve it. when I found out what it ment i never said it for a long time till someone got me so mad i started to say it again.  Now the two opinions still stands how should we blame the parants or the kids, should we take down the stuff that is offensive to us so the kids will learn the bad words? The choose is yours not mine beacuse it was mine i would blame the kids and no we shouldn't take it down stuff that has offensive language because for a lot of us we don't find it offensive to us or others. Just consider this 'what you decide people will be against it no matter what'. Ultimately, the question of blame and censorship is complex, but personal responsibility and the acceptance of diverse perspectives should guide our decisions.
1221	4198	2	3	Libraries across the world are facing the obstacle of censorship. Censorship has become a bigger deal in this day and age. Censorship can effect books, music, movies, magazines, and many more. This posts the question is censorship a good thing or is censorship bad? Censorship allows certain books to be removed from the shelves of a library if a certain person finds the book to be offensive. Everyone has there own opinion about things so why should that effect what we are allowed to learn? What one person finds offensive could be perfectly fine with everyone else. Plus you are not being forced to listen to something you don't want to. If you find censorship ofensive then one solution is very easy, don't listen to it! Censorship not only effects the learner, censorship effects the writer. Censorship takes away the one thing a writer has, there freedom of speech. Writers create books, music, and magazine articles to voice there thoughts on topics, to show others how they see the world, and to show what might happened to them in their life. Because writers do this, censorship makes a connection with the reader that they can understand and relate too. Writers have a choice what they want to convey to the world and they should be given the privalge to do so. Even if you are able to put a censorship on books and music at a library, you can't censor the internet. The internet has become a place where anyone around the world can find websites that they like, where there are books, music, magazines, and even shopping stores. A library is a public library just like the internet is public too. Anyone should be able to acess it and enjoy what they like. Putting censorship on things is almost equivilent to not letting a teacher teach because of there nationality or not letting our president give a speech because he is Democrat. Censorship is based on a opinion someone has. Censorship shouldn't effect the learners or the writers. Censorship holds back the voice of society and the thoughts of everyday people. Censorship should not even exist, as it stifles creativity, limits access to diverse perspectives, and ultimately hinders intellectual growth and societal progress.
1222	4199	2	3	Libraries are often thought of as a room full of books inside a school building. On the contrary, they are all over the country, and are used by people of all ages. Because of that, I feel that there should not be a restriction on what books a library puts on their shelves. If the books and magazines are labeled, then a person can just stay away from what he or she finds offensive. However, in the case of a school library, all the books of course should be age appropriate. Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean you neighbor won't. If someone find a movie ridiculous and inappropriate, that doesn't mean someone else will too. Since all people are different, no one will like the same movies as the next person. Therefor, a personally offensive movie should not be removed from the shelves and prevent the enjoyment of another individual. That is the same with magazines, books, and anything available at a library. Parental concern for their children is also a factor. However, if a public library has a section of books or magazines that is found to be offensive by a parent of a young child, I do not think that should require the library to remove the book. This is where I believe organization and limitations come in. The adult books and magazines that might be offensive for children should be in a section in a separate room, or on a different level of the building. That would prevent the accidental discovery by children. Along with organization, I think there should be a limitation, so that if a child was to purposely walk into that section and grab a book that was not appropriate, or offensive to the parent, then they would not be able to check it out at the desk from the librarian. Outside of public libaries, the school libraries have a different requirement in my opinion. Elementary libraries of course, should contain no inappropriate material to any extent. All of the material in an elementary library should be strictly for education. At that age, children are far too young for any form of adult humor or magazine article. At the **Middle School** and **High School** level, I think things should change a little, but should still be much more strict than a public library, and contain absolutely no offensive content. I feel that magazines and joke books are welcome in the libraries of teenagers. Nothing that would be inappropriate for the school rules though of course. Public libraries are a place for children and adults alike to find a book or movie to entertain themselves, and everyone has a different opinion. Because of that, there should be no restrictions in the public libraries, and you should be able to get the books or movies you want. Within a school corporation the environment changes, and the rules must be changed as well. Nothing offensive should be placed within a school library no matter how old the students are. Therefore, considering the varying roles and user demographics, libraries should not be required to remove books from their shelves.
1223	4200	2	3	I don't think that music, movies, magazines, etc., should be taken away because if you take all of that away then there really wouldn't be anything to do in your spare time but be bored. I know a lot of people couldn't handle being bored. I know I couldn't handle it if I was bored all the time because someone took away music. Now it would be a different story if we never had music, movies, and all that other good stuff. No one would really care because they never knew what it was or heard about it. How would you feel if you had to drive for hours and didn't have any music or magazines to read? I'm thinking you would be really bored, I'm guessing. Entertainment provides an outlet and coping mechanism for many, and without it, life would be significantly duller. Therefore, keeping these forms of media is crucial for preventing widespread boredom and maintaining a more engaging lifestyle.
1224	4201	2	3	Libraries hold more than just books, magazines, and movies... They hold history. Without any doubt, there is offensive material printed on numerous pages spread throughout the thousands of books and magazines a library holds. Some find this terrible, but I, on the other hand, completely disagree. Every book has a different story to tell, and everyone comprehends the content differently, so I think libraries shouldn't take out offensive material from their shelves. What's really considered offensive? This question would be very hard to answer because everyone has a different view, different opinions, and a different background. Some would say violence, drugs, gangs, and sexual situations are offensive... While others consider religion, beliefs, traditions, and morals offensive. With all the different views on what someone finds offensive, a library would have to almost completely clean their shelves just to remove a small proportion of it. There would be no end to the task.  There's many sections in a library, from fiction to children stories. If there is an area for 'children books,' and 'adult books,' can't there be one for materials some readers would find offensive? Libraries could even mark a book if it held something offensive. This would settle many conflicts! If a reader chooses to read a book that was marked with offensive content, they would have no right to get upset. People could be warned.  Limiting our libraries shelves is unthinkable. If someone got offended by what they read, they could put the book down just as fast as they picked it up. A public library is a public place, where many people go... so if one person gets offended by something they read or saw, doesn't mean the next person will. Bottom line is, no book should be taken away because someone couldn't handle what was being said.  'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Everyone's view on offensive material is different; eliminating it would be hard. One person found this book offensive, so it's gone... The library would be pointless. The shelves would empty because of the loss of many phenomenal books. People do get offended, that's just life... I don't think that they should be able to take a book away from everyone just because of one person's opinion on it; censorship based on personal feelings is a slippery slope.
1225	4202	2	3	Censorship has been the topic of many debates involving politicians, activists, and the everyday citizen. There are groups that believe the government has every right to censor anything that is considered offensive in today's society. Some individuals could argue with this belief by supporting the statement that it is not the government's position to decide what is considered offensive and what is not. I just so happen to agree. One opinion, mainly supported by people with children, is that books, music, and movies etc. should be censored to protect the younger generations. While it is true that parents should be concerned with what their children are exposed to, if the offensive material that is involved in the everyday life of an adult is completely restricted from an individual as a child how is he or she expected to be prepared and excel in the future? Why do we go to school for at least twelve years of our lives? We go to prepare ourselves for the challenges of being an adult. We place ourselves in an environment that is specifically created to make us comfortable with the responsibilities of maturity. If not properly exposed to something, there is absolutely no way to be prepared to encounter it in the future. However, not all individuals support censorship because of their children. There are adults that would like to see no more of today's offensive material for themselves than they would want their children to see. My rebuttal to this is that if you do not want to see it then do not choose to see it. No individual is ever forced to be exposed to anything in today's media. Turn off the television if the program bothers you. Do not read the book or magazine. Change the radio station. Every person is capable of controlling what they hear and see, and it is unnecessary to attempt to remove from society what could simply be ignored. Lastly, one of the most consistent debates around censorship is that the government should control what is included in today's media. Think back in America's history; when has giving the government more power in our everyday lives ever been good for our society? The reason our forefathers founded our great country was to have the freedom they were isolated from in England. The Constitution of the United States was created to ensure that the government could not attempt to control what they had no right to control. The freedom of speech is not just referring to what comes from an individual's mouth, but what goes into their eyes and ears as well. The citizens of this great country are more than capable of deciding for themselves what is offensive to them and what is not. It is the government's duty to protect our country from other countries and groups of people who attempt to break it apart, but not to control what we see and hear. Meetings and debates are held everyday to enhance the quality of our freedom and occasionally to gain more freedom. I ask why some individuals would want to give one freedom we do have away? The United States is one of the greatest countries ever to exist, yet we are too lazy to decide what we are exposed to in our everyday lives? It is time for our society to stop being nurtured by the government and start doing our own dirty laundry, and we must take responsibility for the information we choose to consume, ensuring that personal choice, rather than governmental control, remains the cornerstone of our free society.
1226	4203	2	3	Have you ever felt that books are offensive? Maybe, but **what** all depends on who you are and **what** angers you. Some people think that books, music, movies, and etc. can be offensive in some way. I know they can, but **it** can only affect an amount of people if they together understand the problem. I think there are several ways why and why not to take books out of our libraries. From **what** I hear, people do go angry over things but the question is 'what gets them so angry?' **It** is different for some people than others. For example, a **sports team** fan reads a book about them and the author makes fun of them or teases them. That is a way to make someone offended and angry at a book. Others can get mad at a movie because **it** discriminates races of other kinds. Like how in the **19**'s, some movies characterized **African** **Americans** as stubborn, ignorant, human beings. In my view, actually being **African** **American** myself, sort of aggravates me too, but nonetheless, shouldn't argue because of one major amendment, freedom of speech. **It** depends on how **it** angers them also, like how back in world war **two**, the **Jewish** people were characterized as short, fat people with big noses taking all the money away from the **Germans**. That can be offensive, and is used usually to talk people over to their side. I think that if something offends you lightly, most of the time you shouldn't worry about **it**, but if you get offended very heavily and none of the stuff they say about that topic is true, maybe you should get someone else to read **it** with the same dislikes and likes as you. That could help determine if **it** is truly offensive to people in general, not just you. Then after that the main question we would ask would be 'what should we do next?' If I were someone and the book I'm reading offends me massively, I would contact the library **it** came from and ask them to read **it**, and if they think **it** is offensive, then they would more than likely take **it** off the shelves. Now just because of someone that likes a sports team reads a book about them and the book talks trash about the team, don't tell the library, that's just a waste of time. Just simply pick up another book and read **it**. I can understand how people will get mad over racism and discrimination, but not over a sports team. So I hope that people can someday understand the limit to where something can actually be offending, as it is not always intentional. Or maybe it's just in our common nature for us to be offended when something we like gets made fun of. That is why I think that books should only be taken off shelves for only very good reasons, not silly ones.
1227	4204	2	3	I believe that people should be able to remove books, music, movies, magazines, and other things that they need to use. There are many people who need these resources to expand their knowledge. First, we should be allowed to use things such as books from shelves. Everyone should be allowed to access books, whether they belong to another person or a library, because they need to use them and believe they could be helpful to their work. Another important reason is that we don't have enough memory to use in many situations. There are many serious problems and sudden accidents in real-life, and we may not have the necessary information readily available. That's why we should be allowed to take a book from the shelf. Most importantly, people want to gain more knowledge. I think it is a natural human desire to know everything and to be smarter than others or succeed in competitions. Therefore, they need access to many resources to expand their knowledge and take them from the shelves. In conclusion, things such as books and magazines should be accessible for people to take from the shelves, enabling the knowledge contained within them to spread to those who need it and contributing to a more informed and capable society.
1228	4205	2	3	Do you like what I like? Maybe and maybe not. What is or is not offensive to you compared to others varies on both ends. Why? Everyone has their point of view. You may or may not agree and we have others who do not care. There are many factors which include: religious beliefs, having independence, and experimenting.  Religious beliefs are important would you not agree? Certain material in this world maybe offensive to their own kind. Such as gay rights. This may not apply to everyone else that they are not accepting it. For the ones who do accept it, you can tell they are open minded. Unlike the rebels going against it that is their own state of mind. I believe it is important you go along with your religious beliefs.  Independence is what we are or what we assume to have or already have. Whether the music, movies, magazines, etc are offensive to others this has no effects to you. Why? It is because you know what is right and wrong. So what if all the non sense things may have caught your attention. Should you take control and get rid of it? No. It does not bother you. You take it as it is, being independent.  Experimenting is self contained. As simple as it is you do it or do not. It is more than likely that people are/were under the influence. I, myself, have been in that situation before. I'm known to be the crazy child in the family. My dad would always lecture me about being careful with who I hang with when I'm out. As a teenager I let those words pass by me. I was always the youngest out of the people I hung out with. Was I ever under the influence? Yes. Did I ever get hurt? No. I can and will say I experimented with life.  Does it hurt to observe or experiment with the bad? It usually varies. Religious beliefs, it may or may not be disrespectful. To have independence, you are the one in control. Experimenting, that is a choice on your own. What is offensive to me may not be to you. I have my own state of mind and so do you, and ultimately, that shapes our individual perceptions.
1229	4206	2	3	Dear Newspaper,  I believe that the country should remove all books, movies, magazines, and music that contain offensive covers or any offensive, sexually suggestive content. Children shouldn't be exposed to such material casually; for example, the music on the radio, particularly rap and hip-hop, often focuses on cursing, money, cars, girls, and sex. This isn't appropriate for young ears. Adult books containing mature themes are meant for adults, not children, even when available at the library. Children will need to learn about sexual topics eventually, but not at such young ages when they might be exposed to pornography in magazines and movies. I hope you keep this in mind and help to remove this material from public spaces and out of children's reach.
1230	4207	2	3	Banned books. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work that I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson Author  I believe and will stand by Katherine's statement above. Who is anyone to say if a book is offensive? People have a right to their opinion, but I do not think anyone has the right to take books away from a public library.  A public library, the facts are in the name. It is a public library, where people can go and find a book to pass time, a book to use on a school assignment, or a book to read to their child. Taking a book off the shelves just because it offended someone does not make sense to me. A person can pick up a book, be offended and complain about it, that is freedom of speech. I do not see fault in that. But when a person picks up a book, is offended, and demands that the book per se is taken off the shelves of a public library, that is when I have issues seeing where they think they have the right.  Katherine Paterson said in her text that 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Isn't that a scary thought? If a person was offended by a book they could take it off the shelf at his or her own will? I fear the outcome of that. I am sure that a person could figure out something offensive about any book.  Taking books off the shelf is taking knowledge away from the people. We as citizens have the right to read at our pleasure, any book that we have the slightest whim to read, and be able to read that book without prosecution from a people that find the book in question 'offensive.'  The day we let people take books off the shelves because they offend them, is the day our first amendment fails. As a nation we need to stand strong against banning books from public libraries, because limiting access to literature inhibits intellectual exploration and critical thinking. For our generation and for the many generations to follow, we must defend the freedom to read and ensure that diverse perspectives remain available to all.
1231	4208	2	3	One @MONTH1 subject the censorship of library content in certain places and times, whether fictional or not, to his or her own opinion. I personally disagree with the concept. The facts point out that society fears the dystopia predicted by publications exploring the outcome of similar campaigns and has instated systems designed to prevent such occurrences. Certain examples stand in play to explicate my opinion. Society, at least in my native @LOCATION1 and surely abroad in other democratic countries, dislikes enforced censorship for a few reasons. First, many countries have a @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 and priviledges upheld in the face of the law. Our founding fathers wrote out one of the documents establishing this trend on the prompting of the general public. The first ten ammendments to our fine constitution, bundled as the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, resulted. Some of the included statements ensure the freedom to speak as it publicly pleases us as citizens and the freedom to write, individually and collectively without boundaries. The removal of these principles so ingrained in our nation's conscience would cause a general uproar. We as a people instituted our government to preserve our freedoms, and we could prepare ourselves to replace it as implied in the @CAPS3 of @CAPS4 if so required of us to continue doing just that. Secondly, publications such as the ones mentioned for banning rebuke the enforcement of opinion for its effects on society. I can mention three books portraying this dystopic outlook on censorship. '@CAPS5 @NUM1,' required by state standards for one possible choice of reading assigned to us by my teacher, describes book burning and utmost uniformity between citizens. '@DATE1,' by @PERSON2, I know describes a dystopia in which all citizens completely submit their will to and omnipotent '@CAPS6 @CAPS7,' who utilizes omnicient surveillanceeven though I have not read the composition myself. '@CAPS8 @CAPS7,' a recent novel by @PERSON1 whose title employs a pun on the name of @DATE1's prime antagonist, weaves the exciting tale of an older teenager who tries to beat the system of surveillance from under the radar. All, however, betray a sense of fear in their content, and that fear has transferred directly into local civilization. In reviewing the aspects of censorship portrayed in its effects, the system itself reveals that the even the intended creation of a utopia and compliance through censorship @MONTH1 result in decline and misery throughout the area within which government or civil officials practice the method. In any case, a more effective solution must exist today. To prove the point, let me introduce some content advisory systems currently in place. Libraries divide themselves into sections for the various age groups, and therefore create an inherent barrier between differing groups of content deemed appropriate only in the face of maturity. The film and television industries rely on ratings displayed at various times during video to provide the same sort of psychological fence dividing content into pieces. Even the video game industry, into which I plan to inject myself upon exiting college, has a system in place to separate existing media into tiered subcategories designed in a similar way to film ratings. Different regions utilize different systems, but that of the @ORGANIZATION3, or the @ORGANIZATION1 for the @ORGANIZATION2, compares relatively well in ranking video games to the rest of the globe. As explained, censorship already exists in a form accptable to all. Nobody forces anybody to comply to the recommendations, but hopefully everyone does so on their honor. Capable parents most definely follow the guidelines which have cropped up over the years. Only if these methods of moderation were enforced would everyone be upset. It's up to everyone to prevent a situation like unto the worst-case scenario and useresponsibly the systems available for this purpose. These established guidelines and rating systems offer a balanced approach, safeguarding the vulnerable while upholding the freedom of expression and access to information, thus precluding the need for outright censorship.
1232	4209	2	3	The ideas conveyed by literature, music, and movies are an art. They cannot be explained in any other way than themselves, and if we take away the right to produce or the right to sell these masterpieces, then the world loses something of itself. Censorship is the underlying problem to many things. It takes away the expression of human thought and emotion- emotions like greed, love, fear, and the ability to empathize that are conveyed in books and films. If people think it's offensive, they simply can't take the truth.  Many people can only express themselves in their art- and art can be very real. So real that we don't think that it's possible. We don't want to believe something like 'The Street' could happen. 'The Street' is a short story in which kids get together and rob an old man's home. Because this man is very rich, he has lots of material wealth. Then they burn down the house with the man's belongings still in it. Needless to say, this story has been banned from many schools and libraries. But what many don't understand is why would the kids burn down the house. Many think that the kids just want to see it burn, to destroy what is so cherished, or that the love of material things is making us greedy. It is this that makes us think, and therein lies the problems with censorship. If we censor something that makes us think this hard about who we are and what we do here, then we begin to lose ourselves.  The loss of books has been seen throughout history. Most prominantly, the nazi regime. In the beginning of their control of power, they banned certain books that went against the nazi ideals. The censorship escalated into the nazis burning books in large piles. This communal burning would make it easier to control the public mindset. The movement swelled and the German people soon developed a national pride and goal. By the 1930's, nearly every German who could read had read 'Mein Kampf'. The censorship had turned into an all-out war on classical literature and the promotion of nazi ideas. That was how Hitler was actually voted in. Many don't realize, but the Germans actually did vote Hitler to be leader. Now that the nazis had destroyed the publics ideals, they were replaced with the nazi's own.  The banning of media can only lead to a general lack of self knowledge. The human mindset can only be expressed through the art which the human creates. If we try to explain it, we soon get lost in our words. The use of verbal and visual examples is the only way we learn who we are. Censorship has never ended in something good- only the promotion of something bad. If we let our media get banned, we lose the right to have ideas of our own, and we are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past.
1233	4210	2	3	What I think about that is that you have your own thoughts about a book, just because you don't like it doesn't mean that others won't. There may be something that you like in a book that you don't like in a movie, and there may be something that you like in a movie that others may not like in a book that doesn't mean that it should be taken off the shelf. About magazines, if there are things in a magazine that you don't want to look at or have your children look at, then yes, they should be taken off the shelf. I mean come on now, it's a library; there should be certain things that are up there. That's all I'm saying, to ensure the library remains a suitable place for everyone.
1234	4211	2	3	The media is filled with content that some find offensive. It's likely everyone has encountered something in the media that they found objectionable at some point. We also have freedom of speech in this country, so television companies and radio stations generally shouldn't face legal repercussions for airing controversial content. Personally, I don't get offended by media content. I struggle to understand how people get offended, especially since the content isn't usually directed at anyone specifically. The idea of suing record companies over offensive songs seems absurd. It's not the record company's responsibility if someone is offended, and fans shouldn't suffer legal consequences over subjective offense. Ultimately, people's individual sensitivities should not dictate what artists can create or what media outlets can broadcast.
1235	4212	2	3	Certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, and comics can be offensive to certain people. When we look at a comic and see that the writer of the comic has said something offensive, what may seem offensive to you may not be offensive to anyone else. Certain pictures or writings that seem full of knowledge and vibrance to you may be completely something else in someone elses eyes. How many humans inhabit the world today? About 8 billion, researchers say. If you think about it, each and every one of those 8 billion minds thinks differently. If a librarian takes away the knowledge that you find so vibrant, it is like taking away a person's ability to learn. In the world today, many teenagers and young adults are becoming more involved. What that teenager reads in that magazine article could spark a whole new reason to help the world. For all you know, the magazine could have gotten the young adult or scientist one step closer to finding the cure for cancer. How could you just take that away? Again, the magazine could be offensive to a person who may have cancer or a doctor who treats cancer, but will they be offended when their cancer is cured? Or when the doctor can successfully say that all of the cancer in your body has gone away? If we take everything away that could possibly be offensive to other people, we might as well just take all the books, movies, magazines, and comics away that have ever been created. Once again, something that may be offensive to you would not be offensive to another person, because about 8 billion minds do not all think alike. If reading materials were taken away that are found offensive, our ability to learn and grow as humans might as well be taken away as well, thereby limiting our potential and understanding of the world.
1236	4213	2	3	Culture and history are two very important aspects of the world. Libraries are places that house these very things for the enjoyment of all who visit them. This is why I believe libraries should not censor any of their materials. Learning has always been and will be a key aspect of living and libraries offer this to people freely! How can one take that freedom away from another? Not all things in the world and history are perfect and have occurred in the ideal way. However, subjects such as slavery, the Holocaust, and other controversial topics must be known about. These horrible happenings throughout history offend some but they cannot be erased from the past. Learning is natural to humans yet we always try to fight it. It is not right to hide the truth. Some people are easily offended and some are not. But the true question is, 'who is to say what is offensive?'. There are people who believe that discussing evolution in the Christian religion is offensive and others who believe any type of homosexuality is also. Yet there are still others whose beliefs directly contradict these. Libraries must maintain all types of material because their purpose is to hold knowledge and not just what people want to know. How can we make better decisions in the future if we do not recognize what has occurred in the past? Removing information from the library because it is offensive is essentially depriving people of solutions to problems. All aspects of culture and history should be preserved so that we can know where we came from, the mistakes we made, and how we plan to fix our new ones! History has never been in the control of man. In conclusion, libraries should not censor any of their materials. What has happened in the past cannot be changed or altered to fit our ideal visions. And by doing this we deprive future generations of information that could potentially be useful. We must never forget who we are as a people, and where we came from. Our knowledge and ability to learn is our greatest asset and must be treasured.
1237	4214	2	3	People of all ages have the right to read any material that they want, but parents or other family members might tell their children not to read about a certain topic. Those children will either listen to their parents or not. If these children do not listen, we need to do something about it. We need to have rules in libraries. Children do not need bad influences in their lives. Adults have the right to keep children away from this information. Leaders of a library have many different sections in their library. Children and adults both have their own sections as well as teens. These groups of people have a right to choose what material it is that they want to read, watch, or listen to. I believe that if we make the sections have an age limit we can prevent children from finding bad information. Right now, children can read this information at any time. Adults can eliminate it. Children in libraries should be supervised. Too many books are about drugs, sex, or pregnancy. Reading this material can give off bad information to a child. Children are not old enough to be learning about sex. Parents should be the first to tell their child about sex. Young children know about drugs and know that those drugs are harmful. Children learn about drugs in movies, books, and can hear about them in music. Many books deal with pregnancy as well. Learning about pregnancy make them think how that women got pregnant with a child. Those children then start to ask other adults and children. Children can also read or listen about gun violence. Children read about gangs and think that it is cool. They then want to play with toy guns and pretend that they are in a gang. This information is very harmful and should not be allowed to children. After some children read about it they get their friends involved. This information can spread across the school. Violence is very harmful for children. Librarians are not in control of the material people wish to read. If that library has offensive material it is their job not to let that material get into a young person's hands. They should be able to have strict limits on age appropriate material. If a child tries to check out a book and it seems to be over their age limit, they should not be allowed to have the book. The sections that they can find harmful information should be closed to young children. Children in libraries should be supervised. Books about drugs, sex, or pregnancy should not be allowed for children to read. Violence in books seem to spread across schools. Adults can help prevent harmful information from all children, ensuring a safer and more appropriate learning environment.
1238	4215	2	3	"I think that there should be rooms where certain adult books are located. I believe that patrons should be of age to access the books in that section. I feel strongly that libraries should have every different kind of book for anyone. Since everyone goes to a library, I think it should be an open library and have all different kinds of books. If a kid or a teenager is trying to get an adult book, someone of age should have to come there and check the book out for them.  I think that libraries are for everyone in a community, and not everyone reads only ""good, nice"" books; some look at ""naughty"" books, and they should have the right to check out books like that. When you go to a library, you should be able to get whatever genre you want, and there should be no restrictions.  I think that the only restriction that should be made is the age limit on ""naughty"" adult books or novels, and if they are very explicit, they should be behind the desk, requiring proof of age to access them.  My conclusion is, if you are going to cater to all kinds of readers, there should be minimal restrictions on what they can look at, but age verification should be in place for romance novels and derogatory books, ensuring the library has a wide selection of books and magazines while still being responsible."
1239	4216	2	3	What do we find offensive? In a library there are hundreds of materials that can be offensive to anyone. For example with movies there are horror, sci-fi, comedy, romance, adventure, etc. and all of them are offensive to someone. If we were to take down all of the movies that are offensive to a person all the movies would be taken off. Should we take all things that are offensive to us off the shelves, or leave them so people who do enjoy them do? I believe that we should leave these materials alone. It should not be right for us to choose what a public library should and shouldn't have on their shelves. If a person finds an item offensive, then they should ignore it, not make a big deal of it. Many people learn to keep their opinions to themselves but some do not. People who judge by what they don't like, tend to make themselves known; however, a library is a place for everyone, and censorship based on individual sensitivities limits access for others, so tolerance and personal choice are the best approach.
1240	4217	2	3	Censorship is the most foul and terrifying part of society. Our lives have been taken over by political correctness, so much so that our voices are no longer our own. Until recently we had the freedom to convey our thoughts, no matter what those thoughts were, in any form of media. But now if something is found to be offensive in any way it is essentially burned. Censorship limits our freedoms, takes away our rights as citizens and people, shields us from the truths of the world, and limits the knowledge we can take from, as well as ensuring that one day there will be nothing left of media. The Constitution of rights, the document that our country lives by, says that we as people have the right of free speech. Censorship actively and violently violates that right. Our country was built on free speech, and now it is being taken away. Our own words forced down our throats, never allowed to come out. Censorship ensures that no opinions will be heard, that no one's beliefs will be questioned, that no one can assume or think for themselves. Is this not what we are supposedly guaranteed by freedom of speech? We are supposed to be able to say anything we want to say. We know there are consequences for saying certain things, but we are supposed to be allowed to say them. Letting our own ideas into the world allows for new ideas to form. Arguments come, but these arguments allow people to see other ideas that they hadn't thought of and look at issues from new perspectives. We are able to see our world through different eyes when we hear or read someone else's opinions. And from there we can form our own opinions, allowing our world to be rich with ideas and knowledge, and allowing our society to advance. But censorship wants to take this all away from us in order to please everyone. But there will always be someone who is unhappy. It's the inevitable truth.  Censorship is trying to shield us from the ugliness of this world. In a way this makes sense. We don't want our children to understand the atrocities that happen in everyday life. We don't want them knowing what's happening behind closed doors. However, if we don't allow people to open these doors, they can never understand the world or be prepared for the experiences that are to come. Learning the harsh realities of our society educates people, allowing them to stop these realities as well as be prepared for when they happen to them. For example, let's look at the issue of rape. Rape is a horrible thing, but it happens. It is a nasty part of reality. Rape can be censored from books, television, and other forms of media. We can walk around pretending rape doesn't exist. But that doesn't accomplish anything. That doesn't get rid of rape. It still exists. And if the people are uneducated on the issue of rape, how will it ever stop? How will a rape ever be able to be prevented? How will someone know what to expect or what to do? By censoring rape from media, we are ensuring that the people in future generations never learn about rape. Knowledge of rape is important if it is ever going to be stopped. Pretending something doesn't exist doesn't get rid of it. Censorship is supposed to protect the people, but it doesn't. It hurts the people, cutting off their access to knowledge.  We as people need knowledge. We live off of knowledge. And the way we obtain this knowledge is through media. Censorship takes away pieces of knowledge gradually. It may not seem like a lot is missing now, but as time goes on the gap will increase, and more knowledge will be taken from our grasp. Is this fair? Is this right? Is this helping us? How does cutting out knowledge ever help? It brings us backwards in time, makes us fear. It is human nature to fear the unknown. The more that becomes unknown, the more we have to fear. Censorship is taking away crucial pieces of knowledge that we must understand to get along in society. This is wrong and immoral. It is unfair, if nothing else. We should be allowed to take from any knowledge that exists. No good comes from hiding it.  Lastly, this gradual burning of knowledge is affecting society in horrid ways. And as time goes on it can only get worse. Censorship is based off of offensiveness. If something could be offensive, it is disposed of. However, everything that exists in society could be offensive to someone. Therefore everything and everyone should be censored in order to fulfill the goal of censorship. This means all media of any kind should be destroyed. No one should say anything. The world would be forced to be silent. All knowledge would be taken away. Chaos would ensue. The people's freedom would be completely taken away. The freedom to know would vapor
1241	4218	2	3	Materials that are found offensive should not be taken off the shelve. People might need those materials for research or if they just want to find out about something. If the material is offensive to someone they can report it but the people that work at the library might not do anything about it. The people that find something offensive could also ignore it and walk away. If I found something that was offensive to me I would just ignore it. I might look at it to see what it says but I would not say anything about it. There are some people that would have to look at that for research or something else. So why get it removed from the shelve? I have not seen anything that would be offensive to me yet but, if I did then I would not say anything. Now some people would say something but, what if you walked in a library looking for a book for your research paper, and it was not there because someone found it offensive? What would you do? Yes you could get on the internet but, it might not have what you are looking for exactly.  I have had a lot of research papers. There was one time when I went to the library and could not find a book or a magazine to help me with my research. I had to wait for over an hour just to get on the computer to look information up. When I did get on the computer I only had an hour to look up everything. I did not get it done in time and had to turn it in late. Computers are good for looking up stuff, but when you have a book in mind that would give you a lot of information, you go for the book not the computer. Sometimes, physical copies offer unique insights unavailable online.  I know there are materials that are offensive to people. I know people get mad at them but, it is not the librarys fault. They most likely have to have those materials on the shelve because that is whats required of them. So if people do get mad they can report it or just walk away and ignore it. Removing materials based on offense undermines the library's purpose as an archive and a resource center for diverse perspectives, even those we disagree with, ultimately hindering academic endeavors and free inquiry.
1242	4219	2	3	To @CAPS1, it @DATE2 concern, everyone in life has to deal with something offensive towards them at least once. It @DATE2 be swear words in a popular song, or even people's behavior and actions on a regular basis. Be that as it @DATE2, nobody was made perfectly, and we all have to learn to cope with people's flaws. The library is for everyone; not just you specifically. Just like people's personalities we have to deal with different things that fit those specific personalities. @PERSON1's quote said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right...' Censorship is a strong and truthful accusation, and I believe that things in a library should should have some censorship, but up to a specific point.  We all realize that the biggest population of people in a library-- and perhaps the most innocent-- are children. Each parent has different values and standards for their child. What @DATE2 be offensive to one parent @DATE2 not be to another. If one mother thinks a book that talks about something she believes to be inappropriate to her children should be removed, another mother @DATE2 not. The first mother's opinion is different than everyone else; she could say she wanted that book removed from the library, but then so could the second mother about a different book. If everyone voiced their opinion on what books they didn't think were appropriate for their children, then we would 'have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' according to Katherine Paterson. I believe she is right. Besides, who is to say what is right for everyone?  Not one person has the same morals or values as another. For one person to declare what is right could highly offend another individual. I have dealt with situations like censorship before; everyone has. People tell me what they believe to be right, and I do not agree with them. It is simply a matter of everyday life; people's opinions and morals are going to clash. Eveyone is different, and if one person doesn't like a certain magazine in the library, another person @DATE2 not like a different one. If we were to all voice our own opinion on what we want censored and what we don't, nothing would be left. The library shelves would be completely empty. Even though everyone has different opinions on what should stay and what should go, I do believe that there should be some censoring up to a certain point.  Taking into account everyone's diversification in this world, I do believe that there should be censorship up to a certain point. If something is in a book that a good majority of the population are against, I believe that the book, or books should be removed. I am not saying that because a couple of people weren't for a certain artist from the @DATE1 that it should be taken away at once. If it is a major issue that highly offends many people, it should not be in a public library. Libraries are for obtaining information, and for reading; not for brewing up offensive opinions on certain topics. There should be a certain limit on what is in a library, because there are things out there people really shouldn't be seeing or hearing. But it shouldn't get to the point where people can just remove books from the shelf at their own free will. Without some limit on censorship in a library, absolutely anything could be found there.  When we think of a library we don't think of things that are offensive. People view the library as a positive place, created for people's own personal enjoyment. That doesn't mean that we will never find something that @DATE2 offend us in some way there, but people should not be able to just remove books from the shelf because they don't agree with their morals. Life is different, and nobody has the right to tell them what exactly is right or wrong, up to a certain point. I know from experience that it can be a tough thing to ignore sometimes, but we all seem to do it everday with the people around us; we can't just choose to get rid of them. Everyone wants to be comfortable, but sometimes we just have to deal with things in life like a book we don't deem appropriate. So I believe that in a way, an excessive amount censorship on things in a library can be a bad thing. If we all could get rid of what we wanted in a library, there would be nothing left. Afterall, I wouldn't mind walking into a library with shelves full of magazines and books, instead of one completely empty, which is why a balanced approach to censorship is essential.  Thank you.
1243	4220	2	3	Libraries are ment for all types of books, movies, music, magazines. It gives you a variety of things to look at or even check out. An offensive book or movie or even music shouldnt be taken off the shelf just because it has a few bad things in it. People in @MONTH1 may or @MONTH1 not agree with this, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Through my own experiences, observations, and the reading I will help and explain my own opinion in why i dont think offensive books, movies,music, and magazines should not be taken off the shelf. If a book is offensive it does not deserve to be taken off the shelf. Somebody most likley worked hard on that book so it could be put on to the shelf. If you find a book offensive it should be put off into a different section that tells you in head of time what books are in that section. I have not had any real experiences with this but I know people are awear of what are in the books before they're put onto the shelf and would therefore not put anything offensive next to a childrens book. Same thing with music and @CAPS1s. Music is music and it is there to be listened too. People like all types of music and have their favorite bands so if they dont like certain bands because they swear or whatever doesn't mean that album deserves to be taken off the shelf. @CAPS1s usually have the rating on the front so if it is not appropriate for your age than dont pick it up. If it has nudity or sexual content it will tell you or be put in a different section. For instance at my old library where I used to live in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 they would put all rated @CAPS2 movies into a different section and if you were going to check it out you would have to be @NUM1 or older or have a parent with you. It is really all up to the person, they could either make the right choice or the wrong choice. It's not the libraries fault if you pick up an offensive book because well, you should have some common sense. The libraries shouldnt have to take offensive things off the shelfs because some people lack common sense or just dont know what they are doing. They could make more of an effort too kind of seperate bad from good, wrong from right, and even appropriate to non appropriate. But it is usually all up to the person making that decesion. - @PERSON1 Therefore, while libraries could improve their organization, the ultimate responsibility lies with the individual to make informed choices about what they consume.
1244	4221	2	3	I think censorship could be a good thing where there could be a room just for grown ups. In the Dunkirk library there is a room that has just adult books and the kids cannot go in there without a parent. So whenever you go in there your parents are with you. But I don't think you can check them out. But if I had a kid I would not want them to see that kind of stuff until they got older, so I think there should be separate rooms. So whenever they got older and matured they could go in there and see the books and maybe one day check them out and read one of them. But on the other hand, why not leave them on the shelf for kids to see because if not, they're gonna see it other places or from other people then they go home asking their mom what this means and stuff; why not let them learn on their own from a book? There are some people that would agree with that, but then there are people that would disagree with that. So maybe there should be rooms for different books and you can go in them whenever you want, or maybe there should be rules that you can't go in there without a parent. I don't know what to do; maybe there should be a vote between people if they like it or not. But some people would be mad over that, so if you chose one someone would not like it or something like that. My opinion is to just keep the books there and let the kids find out on their own. Some people would think I'm a bad parent, but would you want your child to find out somewhere else? It's a tough decision, but allowing them to discover these things through books might be a better option in the long run, even if it's controversial.
1245	4222	2	3	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I disagree with Katherine Paterson's statement because there is a Freedom of Speech and the Freedom to Write. The author obviously had a purpose to write the novel, compose the music, or to deliver the movie. There will always be items that will be offensive to some people, but to others there is a meaning behind it. The Freedom of Speech gives everyone the right to speak what is on their mind. That Freedom allows them to publish whatever they have to say in a novel, a piece of music, or in a movie. Sure there might be some parts that might be inappropriate somewhere in a novel, piece of music, or a movie, but that doesn't mean the whole item will be inappropriate. Some people might think some things can be offensive while others don't at all. There maybe somethings out there in this world that you might think are offensive, but have you stood up and told that company yourself? Being able to put down anything on paper that you want everyone to know about is the Freedom to write. With that you can't be told not to do so. For example, the 'Playboy' magazine maybe offensive to an abundent number of parents who don't want their kids to look at it, but that magazine isn't intended for children to look at. That magazine's purpose is to show adults what is all out there to buy to make their appearance sexy. It's not to be offensive to anyone and that company has the Freedom of write to publish such a thing. The Freedom to write serves its own purpose to all of the writers, composers, directors, and anyone who wants to write in a journal or to write a note. I bet there has been a novel, a piece of music, or a movie that you just love. Well within it there most likely was a piece of information that was inappropriate, but would you like to see that taken off of the shelf? For example, I once read a series when I was in middle school that had inappropriate content about sexual interaction, but that series is what every girl wanted to read. If they would have taken them off the shelf because they were not appropriate then I know plenty more novels that would be gone as well. What would you say if there was nothing left on the shelves to read, listen to, or to watch? Without items such as books we could have a hard time learning new stuff all the time. These are the items that teach us new things everyday. Would you be able to enjoy your life without being able to read, watching movies or television shows, or listening to music? It would be a very hard thing to get used to in today's society. We rely on such things now to get us through the day and teach us things we were never taught. Disagreeing with the quote that Katherine Paterson stated is one way to use Freedom of Speech by stating my view of removing inappropriate items off of shelves. Removing items of the shelves won't solve the proplem of having too much inappropriate usage in today's society. If everything that had some kind of inapporpriate content in it removed from shelves, we would have a hard time finding a novel to read, music to listen to, a magazine to enjoy, and a movie or television show to watch. Lots of schools rely of books to read and without a book childrens vocabulary could have a great downfall. Think about it...what would you be able to do in your free time if we had no more books, movies, magazines, or music?
1246	4223	2	3	Books, magazines, movies, music, etc, are all good to read, watch or listen to. When I listen to music or watch movies or even read books sometimes, I wonder how do people come up with these ideas. The real reason is why people listen to music, read books watch movies are so offensive. In todays world you got music with all this negative stuff about people, talkin about people, with the curse words its not a good look for the people who make the music or the people who listen to the music. I feel that that stuff not be allowed in the shelves and it should be removed. Parents dont want there little children hearing that negative music. When they grow up they are going to be like them because everybody sings there songs and everything else. I feel movies should not be removed from the shelves. The reason i say is because movies are funny, scary, sad etc. Sometimes u need the offensive in a movie, with out that it would not be good most of the time. One of my favorite is *Bad Boys for Life* and it was about character from the past *Mike Lowrey* and *Marcus Burnett* get back together and do one more mission. That movie was offensive but u still have a good time watchin it because its has the nice cars and good character. Movies should never get removed from the shelves cause out offensive of movies it would not be fun. People can not go to the movies with there friends and have a good time. If u are taking little kids out make sure u pick the right movies for them. To conclude argument Music is not bad thing to listen cause u have good music to but all im saying is make sure to watch what u listen to and get in trouble trying to do what they say in there music. To the movies keep comming out with good movies and keep making the movies good, but it is up to us to make responsible choices about what we consume and expose our children to, ensuring we enjoy entertainment thoughtfully and safely.
1247	4224	2	3	People go to the library to find certain types of material. Some people get offended by some of the material and feel that it should be removed. Certain materials should not be removed if found offensive to others because it might not be offensive to someone else that might enjoy it. The offensive material can be history that the world needs to know, such as racism. If they did not know the importance of slavery they wouldn't know of the past life and why we are treated the way we are being treated. History is a big part of life that everyone should know. That's why we have history class to let us know of the history that we've been through. All material don't have to be history that is offensive. Some material have sex and violence that is offensive. The libraries should have labels on every section to let people know what type of material it is, giving people a choice about what they consume. If people know what type of material it is and still choose to view it then they get what they ask for. It shouldn't be removed because they didn't like it. I learned in history class about wars that had violence in them that some of my classmates didn't like but that's what happened and we needed to know. Materials are made for a reason. They should not be removed if found offensive to someone but not offensive to another. I read books in school with all kinds of violence and other things people might not like but it's history. History makes a difference in our lives and it's what we need. You can not remove that. If you find it offensive just don't view that material again, respecting the right of others to access that material. Ultimately, the library should serve as a repository of diverse viewpoints and historical records, even those that may be uncomfortable, ensuring that individuals have the freedom to learn and understand the complexities of the world.
1248	4225	2	3	I believe that the books, music, movies, magazines should not be removed if they are really offensive. Just because it's offensive to one person doesn't mean that it would be to another person. Any movie you watch could be offensive to one person or two but, not everyone. So I would say no to taking the offensive things off the shelves because, who is really going to be offended by it, and are they really offended by this matter or aspect? Also, I believe that some people might lie about if they are offended by it just so that they will take it off the shelf. Maybe, there is a movie for example, that there is a lot of bad language; I could see them being able to take that off the shelf because, a lot of people don't like those words to be used and that's understandable. If they are just taking it off the shelf though for one little thing, I don't think that should be allowed. I think that if that person is getting offended by what a book said or a movie said then don't read it or don't watch it. Nobody is forcing you to watch or read a book that you don't want to. Reading and watching a certain movie is all up to you not what others say. I believe that this really has to go down to what the person's beliefs are. Maybe they go to church every day which means that they probably aren't going to be watching the movie 'Saw' or 'Friday the 13th.' They are going to pick a movie more suitable to their lifestyle and what they're used to. Maybe they had a friend that suggested that they should watch a movie and they did, they might have taken offensiveness to that, but that was also their choice; they didn't have to watch it. If this was the case to take a book, movie, music out because someone was offended then there would be nothing left. Are you saying that you would listen to everyone if they came in to get a book and then came back and said 'this book offended me, I want you to take it off the shelf?' I'm sorry but, I'm having a hard time believing that you're going to listen to every single person that comes in and says that. Also, how do you know it was offensive to them, are you going to have them show you what was the problem with this book? My guess is no because you don't want to deal with that many people about one or two maybe even five books. I'm not saying that people don't get offended by somethings that books and movies say but, you're going to have a lot more then just one person come in and say that there are more then just one book or movie, so then there would be no books left. What if you have someone come in and they request that they have a certain movie and you say 'I'm sorry, we had to take that movie off the shelf because, it offended someone.' I have a feeling that person is not going to be happy and you will have some explaining to do. Also, what if a person comes in and asks for something and you tell them that you had to take it down and they say that it was a very nice movie, are you going to listen to them also? If you listen to one person, don't you think that it's fair if you listen to the other person also that likes the movie. I am a person that believes there's two parts to every story. So, therefore, I think that you should listen to both sides or keep what you have; if that person wants to take it off the shelf then do it, but if someone asks for that specific one then I would let them have it because that isn't going to hurt the person that got offended by the book or movie is it. Therefore, I think that they should keep the books, movies and music all on the shelves unless more than one person complains, then it would be a different story, but until that time, free access to various forms of media should be maintained to respect diverse viewpoints and individual choices.
1249	4226	2	3	Movies is to popcorn as music is to headphones. Right? It is all fun and games until someone's innocence is completely destroyed. The simplest forms of entertainment are being manipulated by today's world. Many of the children in our modern society are quickly becoming conditioned and used to seeing and reacting to media found in the everyday store, shop, or library. The innocence of the youth today is slowly being destroyed by the subliminal messages found in music, magazines, and movies. The messages are all the same in each type of media: sex, drugs, and violence. The world of music has evolved so much over the past decades of time. We go from jazz, disco, funk, rock, hard rock, to hip- hop/rap. All of these types belonging to a certain decade. But in our era, the music industry is exploding with rap and hip- hop music. This type of music is triggered towards the three ideas of sex, drugs, and violence. Almost every song that is heard today on the radio or on your iPod will most likely have something to do with one of those three. The sense of being so naive and so innocent is broken after listening to these songs everytime the radio is on. The youth does not need to be listening to this whatsoever and therefore, parents should be more aware about what their children are listening to and should think more about the effects that the media has on them. Recently, more and more people are turning to articles and segments of works to read instead of the 'good old fashioned' novels. The novels that were written before our era are clean and nonexplicit. But today, literature has gone down a new course. More and more, magazine companies are becoming less tradional and more upfront about topics that are sexual, violent, or drug related. For example, in a magazine, you will see articles strictly pretaining to sex-like actions. Possibly on the other side of the page, you will see an ad for name-brand cigarettes. Soon enough, kids are going to think that everything they are seeing and looking at will be okay and soon act upon it. The libraries that are offering these magazines for rental should restrict children from reading them due to the lack of modesty and morals found in these magazines. There has always been a sense of subliminal messaging throughout the development and evolution in the cinematic world of movies. Movies are a timeless object of entertainment. But recently, the subtle or blunt 'hints' of sex, drugs, and violence is portayed in almost all movies offered in the box office today. There have been those action packed movies where there is all the fighting and the blood and the punching. Then there are the sappy movies where all it seems the main characters do is have emotional fights that are soon resolved by a session of steamy sexual actions. These types of movies are offered in libraries nationwide and are easily accessible to children. The youth of our country do not need to be seeing all of these actions and hearing these messages. In no way, shape, or form is this morally correct. All in all, library censorship is very weak. The people who organize and let this kind of media float around for kids to pick up have some moral issues that need to be checked. The more times a child reads, listens, or watches media with subliminal or blunt messages about sex, drugs, and violence, the more they are going to think it is okay to act and do these actions. All sense of innocence is destroyed and children are not children anymore, so the media that children consume needs to be monitored more closely.
1250	4227	2	3	Why would you ever censor anything in a library? Apparently because things such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. can be found offensive. If something is considered offensive, why put it in a library anyway if it's going to be open to anyone in the public, including children? First off, censorship is important but we don't need it in libraries of all places. Libraries are a place where all sorts of literature comes together in one place where it can be seen and read by those who admire literature. Censorship is stopping this by pulling books off shelves because they are considered offensive. If a book is offensive, first decide what kind of audience it would be offensive to. Then decide whether or not it is offensive to even an adult audience. If it is found to be offensive to an adult audience, then it should be pulled off the shelves of a library. Otherwise it should be placed in the adult section of the library.  Libraries should have certain sections for certain books and other pieces of literature. As mentioned before, if a book is too offensive for anyone not of adult audience, it should be placed in an adult section. Books that are suitable for children should be put in the children's section. You can even have a section for young adults for books that are suitable for teenagers. Sections in a library almost completely defeats the need of censorship. Sections help correctly place books and other pieces of literature in a library so that only readers of certain suitable ages read them.  In conclusion, sections in a library can be used instead of censorship. If we were to censor what books were on the shelves in a library then eventually there will hardly be any books for anybody. Sections help keep books in a library, but keeps them in a place where the right audience can view them. This allows for a wider range of materials to be available while still offering guidance.
1251	4228	2	3	As a student at a public school, the libraries that I and many students have access to are censored to an extent. With our library being censored I do not feel that the public library should be. Why is censorship a conflict in need of discussion; every book found on a shelf is a part of history so every author that was good enough to get published should be able to have their book on a shelf. While school libraries are already censored for their age group; I feel that public libraries should not be censored for the plain reason that you, your guardian, but also the library has control over what they find age appropriate. If disliking the book is a problem; then put it back. Find something more common towards your own interest. Some things may be considered inappropriate as many things are, but at the same time each person has their own limits to this. While someone may dislike a teen magazine because of how it effects youth, another may find it inspiring. If every person found a way to rate things according to their own taste, there would be nothing left on the shelves; as Katherine Paterson expressed in her quote. When you enter a public library; it is divided into sections according to interest, age, author, etc. When you enter a school library it is done according to fiction, non-fiction and author. Censorship among public libraries is not needed. Adults, students, and children all go to a public library. So, as the case may be why would you censor a library that goes for all ages. I feel that yes an elementary, or middle school library should not contain the same content as a high school library. But a public library, is for the public. Hints the name. In conclusion, if even more censorship was done to public libraries, libraries would be used less than they already are. Some of the content in public libraries can't be found in school libraries, but also adults wouldn't be able to find the content needed for their own interests, jobs, or even schooling. So as the fact may be that some things may seem inappropriate to certain age groups, it can help someone in a completely different age group, showing the importance of keeping diverse content available to all.
1252	4229	2	3	I personally believe that there shouldn't be a whole lot of censorship in libraries, except for things such as complete smut and pornography. However there are many different beliefs on this subject. Some parents this @MONTH1 think it's necessary to control every bit of information a child takes in, while others are more forgiving. The main conflict with this issue is how different everyone's restrictions are. A lot of parents believe that if any politically incorrect information enters their child, he/she will be corrupted for life, but that is completely false. Nowadays, almost every single person goes through something traumatic, witnesses something illegal, gets involved in drama, experiments sexually, and/or experiments with drugs. The truth is, it's everywhere, and your kids have already experienced it and are used to it. Reading one book with a couple curse words here and there, or an intimate moment isn't going to ruin your child, because chances are, he/she is already doing it all in real life. It this @MONTH1 even be happening in your own home and there is nothing that can be done to stop it. Trying to control our lives as if it was your own provokes kids to rebel even more when the chance arises. I say don't worry about censorship in libraries except for the obvious things like pornography, and sex novels, racist books, ect. Maybe if we quit hiding so much from the more mature teenagers, and quit treating them like toddlers, they wouldn't go looking as much for all of the 'bad' things out there. Parents need to quit thinking they can get their child to believe there is nothing bad in the world. If they aren't aware of the mistakes that can be made and the consequences from it, they won't know what to do if they find themselves in a similar situation as one of the characters in one of these 'offensive' books. Instead, allowing access to a wide range of books, with appropriate guidance, can help teens navigate the complexities of the world around them, and can better prepare them for the challenges they will inevitably face.
1253	4230	2	3	Offensive media. Books, music, magazines, movies, commericals. Is it right to have all types of media shown to all ages? I disagree. A variety of people could take offense to the content this media contains. I think that there should be a designated area, or all the alarming media should be removed so everyone can be at peace when they are at the library, or just watching television in their own home. Even though some people may not take offense to any type of media, you have to think about the parents. A majority of parents would not want their children to be surrounded by all the effects that this media brings. Some content may not be suitable to younger kids. Whether it be going to the movies or just going to the library, children can see all the violence and misbehaving going on in the world today. I believe that drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big influence on kids these days. I think it is our responsibilty to protect them until they are at an age they can make their own judgements. Religion. Our religion plays a big part on what we think is right or wrong. I was taught to always treat people with respect and to try my hardest to get along with others. A lot of the media contradicts what I have been taught. If you see something on television with your favorite actor or actress on it, we tend to believe it is acceptable behavior. If you have ever been to a movie theater, you know they have certain ratings. The ratings are there to protect younger kids from getting into adult movies. They enforce this rule to an extent, but I don't think they enforce it enough. At the least, libraries and movie rental places could have a designated area for adult rated content to respect those who disagree. A few years ago when my little sister was about two or three, she was watching a movie with me and it had a few curse words in it. She had never heard them that often and wasn't sure what they meant. For the next couple of days, she went around saying the word and my parents weren't very happy. She had no idea she was doing anything wrong because she heard it on a movie and if they could say it, then she could too. Children sometimes don't know any better and if they would happen to say it to a stranger, they would be offended. Media can be harmless, but it can also be offensive. The safest way to keep the new generation respectful, is to shield them when they are young so that they can learn what is right and what is wrong. When they come out into the real world, they won't be difficult to put up with and will have proper manners. No one will ever agree on the same things, but in the end, we need to do what is right for the betterment of our community, and protecting children from potentially harmful content is a crucial step in that direction.
1254	4231	2	3	The book called *The Outsiders*. The book is about a young, poor man that starts school at a new high school. While the first few weeks in school he is picked on and made fun of. So one day he has to join a boxing class, and the wrestling team at his school. But at the end of the book he ends up fighting everybody the was bulling him. I personally think the book should be kept on the shelf because its a life changing experience for a young man. For some people this book they will or have even read this book several times, I know I have. I only hope that other people will like or even love this book as much as I have. So I guess what I am trying to say is you really never know what you are going to like in till us sit there and read it from beginning to the end, and you might discover a new favorite.
1255	4232	2	3	When you go into a library, have you ever noticed the diverse range of subjects that authors explore? Some draw from personal experiences, while others create entirely fictional worlds. I strongly disagree with the notion that offensive books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from libraries. The creators of these forms of entertainment intended for their work to be accessed by interested individuals. Furthermore, if libraries face challenges due to complaints about offensive content, they could establish a separate section dedicated to such materials.  To begin with, the purpose of books, music, movies, and magazines is multifaceted. They entertain us, broaden our understanding of various topics, and ignite our interests. Without these creative outlets, life would undoubtedly be less stimulating. While I'm not advocating for the necessity of offensive materials, their existence encourages us to think critically about complex issues. Producers create 'offensive' content to capture attention and readership, not to have their work relegated to obscure corners of the library due to some people's disapproval. If such content is not to one's liking, it's best to simply avoid it. Why should libraries hinder creators from earning a living from their work? It's already challenging for them to determine if their creations are worthy of being shelved. Many books are poorly written and a waste of time to read, so should they be removed too? That's something to consider.  Secondly, I believe that removing these materials is unnecessary because libraries have the option of creating separate sections for them. While it may incur some costs, is it not preferable to potentially losing numerous patrons? Libraries are generally quite spacious, and I'm confident they can find additional room. They already categorize materials by genre.  While I understand the concerns of those who advocate for removing potentially offensive materials, particularly regarding children's exposure to such content, it's important to consider the broader implications. I recall reading a story about a man who, after reading a book by a former college acquaintance that graphically described the killing of women, was inspired to commit a similar act against his own mother. The man was incarcerated, and the book was removed from library shelves. However, I maintain that the book should not have been removed solely because an immature and ignorant individual chose to act upon its contents. The book was a work of fiction, and the man was likely delusional and mentally unstable. Due to his actions, the author suffered financial losses and a significant waste of their time and effort.  In conclusion, no material should be removed simply because it's deemed offensive. Some individuals lack the understanding to appreciate that books, music, or movies are made for entertainment purposes for those who are interested in that particular genre. As I mentioned earlier, these materials are intended to be read, heard, or watched. Creating a separate section for them would be an excellent solution, providing access for those who seek it while addressing the concerns of others.
1256	4233	2	3	"All terms of offense are based on an opinion. If one person finds a particular word offensive, doesn't mean the next guy will feel the same way. Some parents aren't as strict on their kids as others, and some just don't care. Of course there's always that gangster rap that talks about drugs and women being objectified that kids really don't need to be listening to. The horror movies that are rated ""R"" for a reason, they could have nightmares for weeks. Children's mental states aren't fully developed at a young age like ten. They still can't tell what's real and what's not. They need a trusted adult to rely on to tell them how to feel, to act, to do, even to think. Children just aren't mature enough to handle a majority of material in this world. No books should be taken away or hidden from society, it should just be given to you at your own discretion. Another possibility would be to have a group of many people gather and vote on age restrictions for particular material. All information is helpful, just not all is necessary. These days it's hard to hide all harmful material from children, even some teenagers. This world is becoming less and less sensitive everyday. Eventually everyone will be completely insensitive to all 'harmful' movies, books, magazines, TV shows, and music. It won't even phase anyone anymore. Thus, finding a balance between protecting children and preserving access to information is essential, requiring careful consideration and open discussion."
1257	4234	2	3	"Censorship in libraries is something good to have and something bad to have. I think that there could be some things adults can read and some things kids can read. You don't want the kids reading anything thats too mature for them right? Libraries are found all over the country. A lot of people say, ""THEY SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE THE BOOK THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE,"" well they shouldn't even have the book there in the first place. PEOPLE think about this, maybe you should just have your kid under control and watch what they read. Or option two, dont have your kid go to a COMMUNITY library. COMMUNITY, which let me explain, is COMMUNITY. Which means the whole community can go pick out something.  A COMMUNITY library is suppose to have a variety so anybody can find a book they would like to read. Yes some things are very inappropriate for kids, doesn't mean we can't have it in a COMMUNITY library. Just make sure that you know what your kid reads. If you do that you should be fine, and your kid will be the same.  That's how i feel about censorship in a library. Its COMMUNITY, so it's meant to have everything. Which everything includes the good and the bad. I think some people just have to live with it. So I honestly feel that libraries for the way they are is to be left alone, and parents should take on the responsibility of guiding their children's reading choices."
1258	4235	2	3	Has anyone ever stopped and thought about the negative aspects of censoring a book? Many people of different beliefs take offense to books that show negativity to their ideas. When people are offended by a book the first idea that comes to mind is to try and get the book off the shelves by censoring it from libraries. I think that if a book offends a certain group of people they should just simply not read it. Why should other people not get a chance to read a good book just because it offends someone else? Banning books would go against what our country stands for, limiting the free exchange of ideas. How different would it make us if we started censoring books in our libraries like other countries with governments who have the final say on what can and can not be read? Imagine what life would be like if all books found offensive were stripped from our shelves; there would be nothing left because anyone can find something offensive in any book. I understand that sometimes things written in books can really be disturbing, and offensive but that doesnt give anyone the right to just take it off the shelves. Censoring books is a short term answer to a long term problem because it does not address the root cause of disagreement. I believe that if we always resort to censoring books then we will become a less creative society. There are many people who actually want to read a book but never get a chance just because it is censored from library. Books that are censored are usually the books that help ones imagination and potentially spark critical thinking. Would you want to live in a world where people are void of creativity, limiting our growth and understanding?
1259	4236	2	3	To be honest if I was a librarian I would leave them up on the shelves according to what @MONTH1 state law would have to say. If the state doesn't have any problems with having them up on the shelves then all student body will be able to check them out. Having magazines shows what's new in the world and what is not. Also just like checking out a book how you have to take a test over it called reading counts, students would read an article from a page in the magazine and write an essay over it and submit it to whoever is in charge of that department. This approach ensures both access to current information and academic engagement.
1260	4237	2	3	Many things such as books, music, magazines, etc., cause problem acts for children, but I say that everything should stay in the library because there are more things that cause such acts than the things listed. Many children get their acts from books, movies, and magazines but most get their acts from something different. Children get most of their acts from the television they are viewing at home which causes them to think if their parents don't care about what they're watching then it's okay to view whatever. So the most that is causing acts is what is being viewed at homes or in the movies. So I really say that it's okay for children to read or watch whatever is legal on television. But to me in the libraries it's up to whomever is controlling it to decide by ages, just like legal things only legal for adults. I say that it's only for adults because children start arguments from whatever they see especially when they're around their friends. When children are around their friends they feel that it's cool to do whatever. And it's all coming from things based on violence in the books that children read more often. So to me I will say that it shouldn't be okay for them to view everything, and age-appropriate restrictions in libraries should be considered to help mitigate negative influences.
1261	4238	2	3	I have read books that I disapprove of, and while I feel I have a right to remove them, I question whose views should hold such sway. I don't believe in banning books or music. Instead, I think libraries should enforce stricter age limits on books and create designated spaces for different types of media. I wouldn't want my child to access books about sex, gangs, or other inappropriate content. Rather than banning these books, a strict, enforced age limit would be more effective. While libraries have adult and children's sections, I've seen young children with adult materials. Similarly, I understand the frustration of trying to read in a library while others play loud music through headphones. Instead of banning music, it should be restricted to certain areas out of respect for those seeking quiet. I don't want to take things away from people because everyone has different interests, but I do believe in setting and enforcing rules. I see the value in libraries if they could exclude certain content from specific areas and adhere to age limits on book checkouts, creating a more respectful and appropriate environment for all patrons.
1262	4239	2	3	They should be aloud to be removed because some books are offensive. Even if they are offensive they can teach young teenagers about their past. The books could be about the kkk or the @ORGANIZATION1. Some young teens like to read books like this so they can learn and see what people went threw. The books could be a school assignment. The way i see it is if your teenage child is interested in the history or the violence of the past you should allow them to read what they want. Some book such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS6 are great to read for school assignments. These @CAPS6 book's are very helpful to read because you can learn about your history and about the wars at the same time. I think if your child checks a book out from the library he or she should return it in a week.  The library should give the child a certain amount of time to return the book. If the child dose not return the book in that amount of time they should charge them for every day it is late. If the book is damaged they shud charge who ever checked that book out. The book shud be in the condition it was in when it left so other people can check it out after its returned. the library should keep certain books at the library such as the bible and collage books.  The libary should allow @CAPS6 books to each person. Instead of three or four this would keep books on the shelfs. It would also keep people from loosing books. I think people under twenty @CAPS3 should not be aloud to check out movies or music. I think they should have to show i.d. to prove there over twenty @CAPS3. there should be more rules then just being quit in the library they should make people start keeping books at the library and only allow them to take home @CAPS3 or @CAPS6 books. For instance i check out @CAPS3 book every week and return the @CAPS3 i checked out the same day i go to get a new @CAPS3. I only check out the book i really want to read and i read it and return it. The magazines should never be checked out, so that everyone has access to them. By adhering to these guidelines, the library can better serve the community and ensure materials are available and well-maintained.
1263	4240	2	3	I think they shouldn't be pulled off the shelves because everyone has different opinions. One person @MONTH1 might think a book is offensive, but the next @MONTH1 might not. Some people @MONTH1 think any books with God or Jesus in them are offensive, but that @MONTH1 might just be because it is not their religion. If every person took off a book that they thought was offensive, there would be no books left, because people think differently. Or some @MONTH1 might not like the @PERSON1 books because of the violence and goriness, but to some people those are their favorite books, so that would be unfair to the ones who like the books that others don't. There are many books out there that not everybody's gonna like; the difference is how you think and what you think is right and wrong, and ultimately, banning books based on subjective offense limits the freedom of thought and expression for everyone.
1264	4241	2	3	Censorship in libraries? Is it a problem? Should we fix this 'problem' or is it for the good? People of different culture, background, and life could be profoundly affected by articles and readings. Can these books be offensive? They could be offensive to some but to others only educational. Statements have been made all over the world of people speaking on what they believe is right or wrong. How many people believe that censorship in libraries is really offensive and should be removed from libraries? Who really are the victims when books and magazines are being thrown off the shelves? The author of that specific article, that's who. If it is said that every reading that comes off offensive should be taken off the shelves, then what would be left on them. Some people find romances offensive, or comedy, or horror. Romance could be hurtful to someone only because they maybe just got out of a relationship, or comedy because they are miserable and don't know how to laugh anymore or know what happiness is. Who knows? Opinions such as these would be not only terrible for business but also terrible for the educational and historical parts of life itself.  People of different races and cultures often have another opinion on the situation of censorship. From all over the world, there are cultures spreading throughout. Being born into a religion could be a huge factor on what their outcome is on a book, magazine, or a movie. Movies of past experiences or massacres that happened to a culture can be difficult for some people of that culture to take in. The normal response to a movie such as that would be to become angry or frustrated. Only for others it is an opportunity to learn what those people went through and grieve for the loss of the people during that time, to support the people who made it through those heart breaking times and become a friend to them and learn more about them, their culture, and way of life.  Have you seen protests arise before you? Anywhere in the world? On television, hear it on the radio, or see it in the newspaper. Everyone has most likely seen this type of protest or attack on the opinion of another person. There have been protests in the past of the freedoms of a person or even race. If everyone begins to complain and argue of what is being put on shelves in libraries, what will come of our world? What will we know about the past? What will we begin to predict for the future? Anyone, and even I, can make observations of the acts going on around us. In my experience, I have seen of attacks being struck upon people who only put a picture in the newspaper, or a small article spoke out on television. Who are we to say that everything needs to be removed off the shelves in libraries? These are just people who have been hurt and don't want to relive that experience.  Overall, my opinion on if censorship in libraries should be extinguished is no. Every person in the world is going to be upset, hurt, or broken about something at least a million times in their lifetime from now on, whether it be in books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else. They just need to understand that without every person's culture, there would be no history of life before us, and denying access to diverse perspectives ultimately harms our understanding of the world.
1265	4242	2	3	"We as citizens have the right to say what we want, and do as long as it is within the laws. If they take away some books because they are racy or because some people find them wrong, then they are saying we shouldn't learn the history of our civilization. A great man once said 'those who do not learn from the past are condemned to repeat it.' Censorship is saying that if we take away the books that are even obscured we are taking that history away from our children and they will do the same mistakes that we have done in our lifes. Taking away the content that is obscene will make our children unknowledgeable to the fact that it happened or how the past really was. ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn's"" context is under criticism because it uses the 'N-word' a lot in the text. There is no reason to change the book because that is how the people talked, back in the day, and how things were done. If they change the book they change history and they take away knowledge from the children of tomorrow that slavery was a harsh, harsh thing. When I think of censorship in the library, I think of how the school board is trying to change the past and how it is trying to nerf the childrens history of what really happened. Censorship should be on tv, movies, and music so the little kids dont see the wrong things to early, but when it comes to literature in the library they shouldn't do it at all because only the literate people will know what it means and what the text is actually saying. There should not be a censorship in the literature of the past, the present, and the future, because restricting access to literature ultimately hinders our understanding of history and the complexities of the human experience."
1266	4243	2	3	"In my way of viewing things, I think that books, movies, music, and magazines should be organized in a way that highlights critical perspectives. Some of us want to read or see things that confirm our existing views, like news that seems ""good"" to us. However, others want to understand what's behind the surface reality and want to speak up, but are afraid of the consequences. Therefore, these forms of media should not be removed from shelves, because they can reveal important truths about the world and how it affects us, especially in ways we might not be aware of. For example, I once heard a song in Spanish called ""@CAPS1 The @CAPS2"" that talks about corruption in @LOCATION1 and how the people at the bottom suffer because those at the top don't care. It also says that if you treat them as kings, they will treat you as slaves, and if you give them the @CAPS2 to control you, they will take advantage of it. The song highlights how honest people work hard to bring food to their homes, but it's not enough because of the leaders on top who want everything for themselves. It's a very powerful song that speaks truth, yet nobody does anything to change the situation. I don't want songs or books that show this reality to disappear just because some people don't like them, as access to diverse perspectives is crucial for understanding the world and fostering change."
1267	4244	2	3	I believe that everyone's opinion deserves to be publicized fairly. Just because one person's view is considered to be right, doesn't mean another is wrong. What is offensive to one person might be informative to another. I've read a lot of books that parents might not pick out for their children. In reading these books I see that there is no glamour in doing drugs or getting in trouble with the law. For some teens, books like these can show them the side of life they haven't experienced and find that they never want to.  If a book is too explicit for children, simply place the book in another section. I realize that there are books with graphic sexual details, and those should only be permitted to be checked out by adults. Parents should have concerns about their children's innocence. But I also believe that they should watch over what type of books they're reading to monitor the vulgarity of them.  Some music contains profanity or sexual innuendoes, some contains praise and worship, others even have screaming. Any of these types of music can be found offensive by someone. That doesn't mean to run off and hide all of them. There'd be no music left.  Not everyone shares the same opinions in this world, therefore there should be equal opportunity for people to read, watch, or listen to whatever suits them. I'm not saying that there should be a stock of porn in the library, but if there are movies or books about shunned religions or beliefs then they should be just as welcomed as the ones about common religions and beliefs.  Everyone finds different things offensive. If there was a bible in the library and someone found it offensive, should it be removed? It's one of the most popular books in the world, yet some people still find offense by it. Someone who is Mormon, Muslim, or atheist might find it offensive if there is nothing in the library about them because some people find it offensive.  The library is a place of knowledge, not judgement. I don't believe that certain books should be removed from the library if they offend someone. If you don't like something that is at the library, don't rent it. If you don't want your children to, don't let them. Simple as that. Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech, and we should respect each other's right to access diverse perspectives. Authors express themselves through books and articles, directors through movies, and musicians through their music, which are all valid forms of expression.
1268	4245	2	3	I believe that if it has offensive language then it shouldn't be left on the shelf. It really matters if it has offensive language because you don't know who, where, or when your child is going to learn offensive words, or even say any offensive words. One of the most important things is that if you want your child to never use offensive language or do anything bad, you should watch what you say and do. One reason why is because once he's growing up, he might follow in your footsteps. Also, if the magazine, movie, book, etc., contains something racist, like judging a person based on their origin, appearance, or speech, it can lead to a bad situation. In conclusion, I'm trying to say that it's up to both parents and the book because the book your child has chosen might contain bad things, and the parents should watch themselves and how they act, in order to prevent negative influences.
1269	4246	2	3	Every parent wants to protect their child's innocence. They do not want their children to come in contact with things that might influence their decisions. The truth is though that they are going to run into these types of things eventually, whether it be from other kids at school, what they see on television, or what they see on the internet. It is their choice as of what decisions they are going to make, so I do not think libraries should be censored due to the content of the material. One reason libraries should not be censored is because nobody is forcing a person to pick up material that might have offensive content. It is all about choices. There are a lot of other options on the shelves that do not include such topics. Some people frequently want to read or watch something with such content. Taking these pieces out of libraries would not be fair to them. People should have the option to read or watch what they wish. Censoring libraries would take away these people's right to such topics. Another reason libraries should not be censored is that eventually nothing would be left. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This is a very true statement. After one censoring, people might still think topics are inappropiate, and the libraries would have to be censored again and again until there is nothing left. People eventually will not be able to use libraries. Losing libraries as an option will cause people to lose their right to that resource. A final reason that libraries should be left uncensored is the difference of opinions. What might be offensive to one person might not be to another. How would what should be gotten rid of and what should not be decided? It would be much easier to just leave the people to make their own decisions on what okay to read and watch and what is not. Nobody is forcing people to pick up a book or magazine that is going to offend them. If you do not like what is being discussed, do not read or watch it. It is as simple as that. There are many more reasons libraries' content should not be censored, but here are three reasons that are obvious. Censoring libraries are going to eliminate a person's choice. It will cause problems, as to what is appropiate and what is not. Eventually libraries will have nothing left. Of course every parent wants to protect their child, but eventually they are going to grow up and have to make their own choices. Censoring libraries is not going to stop children from learning about offensive things. All you can do as a parent is raise them well and hope that you have taught them right from wrong. Thus, it is more beneficial to allow open access and guide children through discussions rather than to restrict access and potentially limit their understanding of a diverse world.
1270	4247	2	3	I think censorship of certain materials, books, music, magazines, etc., that are offensive should be applied to people who have yet to mature, unless a parent or guardian approves of it. I think censorship can be a positive thing for little children and younger folk because kids that are young should not view or listen to negative things. These things can be a negative influence on a child's character and personality, shaping them in undesirable ways. No one should hear other kids cursing in public because this can influence other kids to do the same. I know my parents don't want to hear me say or do bad things around my younger siblings because this can influence them more to do it too than if some kid was saying or doing bad things. Some censorship shouldn't be allowed to those who are matured, such as in high school where you have to get a signature from a parent to see some things that should not be shown to little kids because older people have matured and they understand why not to be a bad influence on people. Censorship of certain materials, books, music, magazines, etc., that are offensive should be removed from people that have yet to mature, unless with parental consent, ensuring they have some protection. People who have not matured should not view or listen to anything that is a negative influence on themselves, protecting them from potentially harmful content during their formative years. Therefore, a balanced approach to censorship, considering age and parental guidance, is crucial for the healthy development of young individuals.
1271	4248	2	3	Everyone loves to take their little children to the library and pick out all kinds of books to read, but what if your child picks up that one book that, let's say, just isn't what you want them reading? Then what do you do? Take the book from them? Look for more and just let it go? Well, you cannot blame the library for having the book. Or say you see books you do not like on the shelves at @ORGANIZATION1. Not only books but music or movies. Even if you find it offensive, someone else might not. It should not be a big issue at all because not everyone thinks alike; some of those books, music, or movies could have great information for others, and also every book, music, or movie has its purpose. Although you @MONTH1 not see it every time, it is something that you do not like.  Wow, the world would be SO boring if everyone liked the same music, read the same books, or just watched the same movie over and over again. Everyone has the right to choose what they like and enjoy watching, reading, or listening to. The libraries and stores also should have the right to put whatever they want on their shelves. Yes, some things are not appropriate for others, such as younger kids, but it does not matter. You as a parent should do your best to keep them away from those things you do not want them to see or hear.  Another thing is that just because you do not like something or think it is stupid does not mean that another person does not love it! Not your average teenage girl is going to want to read about building a house or listen to music from the @NUM1's, but does that mean that stores should not sell them? Everyone has a different taste, just like in music. Most younger kids these days are starting to listen to the fast rap music that their parents swear up and down you cannot understand, although in reality, some of those songs have great meaning to us teenagers.  Lastly, every song, book, or movie has a meaning. Not everyone will see the meaning, but it is there. Everyone has their own opinion. Libraries or stores should not take things off their shelves just because one person thinks that it is inappropriate, as diversity in content allows for individual exploration and discovery.
1272	4249	2	3	"I believe that people should not be able to remove books, movies, magazines, etc., from the shelves of libraries. If someone takes offense to a movie, book, or magazine, they should contact the author of the piece and can complain or give their thoughts. Even if someone does find someone's work in a wrong way, people have their own opinions and thoughts about everything in life and are allowed to voice their beliefs and disbeliefs. Also, people can read on the front or back of other people's work which summarizes what the work is going to be about or what the work is talking about. People can decide then if they would like to read or watch further into it. Everyone in this country is allowed to say what they think, and if someone takes the time to get their voice published, then others might want to hear what others think. People can disagree; no one has to agree with anything anyone says. It is alright to not agree with another person says, but everyone does have the right to stand up and say what they think about the situation. For example, if my coaches were to tell me that they think I'm doing something wrong in gymnastics or they think something doesn't look good when I do, I let them speak. I let them tell me what they think would look better or would give more points. Then after they're done talking, I give my thoughts and say, ""I think this because this."" I try to reason with them. For one, it's more respectful, and for two, everyone can have their own thought about something. And who knows, they actually might be right if you give them a chance to speak. But, if you really don't like what another piece of work might say, you can always not read what they wrote, or watch what they produced. There is no need to be rude. If you strongly disagree, you can always write your own book or publish an article voicing your own thoughts, that way someone can disagree or agree with how you feel about a certain subject. That is why I feel that they should keep all books, magazines, movies on shelves, allowing for a diversity of perspectives to be available for those who seek them out. Everyone is allowed to express themselves and explain their actions toward a certain matter, and censorship through removal limits this important exchange of ideas."
1273	4250	2	3	To whom it may concern: The idea of censoring books, music, movies, or anything else from libraries or from the public eye is very offensive. There are many things that could come off as 'offensive' to any individual. Taking books or anything off the shelf because someone felt that it did not go with their certain morals or beliefs is against the writer's freedom of speech. It also can start serious issues with feuding religious groups or persons of different ideas. This also shows that the library, or so far as the country, is under one certain idea and other ideas that conflict with that will be oppressed. One of the biggest concerns is that the freedom of speech is taken away. It could be something as trivial as 'Clifford's Halloween?' now, but if people keep taking books off the shelf because they find something wrong with it, then our freedom is taken away. 'Clifford's Halloween?' was brought up because a mother had actually gotten a certain book of the 'Clifford's Halloween' series taken off the shelf, because her child had gotten scared of the halloween edition. The fact that something could be banned for something so trivial is a frightening thought. There weren't many cases of this specific Clifford scene scaring all the kids, so there was no need to get it banned. When someone finds something even a tad wrong they want it banned and thrown away, never again allowed to be shown to those that might even find an interest in it. A big thing that might conflict with censorship is the idea of religion. The Bible is a published work, whether it is religious or not. Who's to say that it can't be banned? What if someone of a different religion found it highly offensive? This could cause even more conflicts between religious parties, and in turn anything religious would be banned all together. That small, faint line between state and religion is going to get blurred solely from censorship. If the Bible or works for catholics get banned, then so could published works for wiccans, muslims, buddhists, and any other sources of religion. There would be nothing for a religious or spiritual person to find comfort in. Not to mention the fear some publishers or authors will have in publishing their works. It will then become a topic far less talked about, for they would be afraid of getting into legal or social trouble for expressing their thoughts and feelings with their spirituality or religion. This censorship will only cause future issues. This could lead to not only the religious books being banned, but anything that strays from the social norms. If someone was homophobic, they might start having a gay author's works banned, or just a book about the LGBTQ community banned. That small sense of security those in that community have in those books will be taken away. Personally, I find comfort and my sense of being alone is dulled by these books. There might even be a possibility that some books, not necessarily just LGBT books, hold someone up from that pit of depression they are so close to. It is a world someone loves to enter, to hide or confide in. To take someone's mental safety is worse than taking their physical safety. Most people do not realize what sort of trouble they will start with censorship. It might mean nothing, but those that decide whether or not to censor something have to think of the picture at large; Do they lose customers for keeping it on the shelf? Or do they lose customers, and stop giving the rights of freedom of speech? It is a heavy decision to make but the decision could make or break the publishing group or legal party, thus emphasizing the importance of protecting freedom of speech and expression for all.
1274	4251	2	3	Devin @NUM1 @NUM2 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Do you like the libary? There is always an argument about how books, music, movies, magazines, ete., should be removed from the shelves if people find them offensive. Which brings me to @CAPS1 @CAPS2; there is always the choice of a different libary to choose from. You also don't have to look at the book or watch the movie. Being an @CAPS3 author you have the freedom of speech, you can write whatever you feel like writing. First, is your choice of libary. There is sevral different libraries in one town, providing diverse selections. Some have childern sections, where all the books are appropriate for young childern to read. Also the parents of the childern need to keep an eye on what their child will be reading, or looking at. There has to be at least twenty to thirty libaries in @LOCATION1, so you always have a different option. Second, you don't have to read the book, or watch the movie. If you see something you don't like about the book, why complain about it? Just put the book down, someone else might be interested in the book. You have the freedom to pick out the book. Last, is the freedom of speech of the author of the book. Being an @CAPS3 citizen you have the right to write down whatever you want to write down, expressing their views and ideas. So people do not have the right to blame the author for what he or she writes down. Many people have been inspired by certain books that throughout history have been controversial. Where would we be without those books and authors? I have given you three reasons on @CAPS1 view of censorship in libraries. You have the choice of libraries, you don't have to read the book, and the author has the freedom to write what they choose, reinforcing the importance of these considerations.
1275	4252	2	3	Hiding @CAPS1? By: @PERSON1 to the harsh world we all live in, I do not believe it is morally correct for a program, of any kind, to hide the hard reality of our world from any person. @CAPS1 will be @CAPS1 and one shouldn't ever hide what is true from the eyes of another person's mind. If one person makes the choice to close his eyes and go into a fantasy world then that is one person's right as a human being. However, one man has no right- whats so ever- to close the eyes of another person for them. Personally, I myself am not afraid to look into the history of man's choices and take upon myself the burden of the harsh knowledge that I have inherited. I look at the human race of this planet to be whole and to be one with another. This planet doesn't belong to one race, nation or culture of people; it belongs to every single person equally. I made the decision to take on the resonsibility to know the past and use it's lessons to better the future. This world belongs to me as equally as it belongs to you; so my decisions will affect you as much as they affect me. That being stated, every person's decisions impact everyone, not just one's self. People think that we should hide things that are 'offensive' to other people. Racism, world political issues, casualties of war and personal ethics- are some of these 'offensive' things. However, offensive or not, these subjects are very real and very much alive in our world; So why should anyone have the right to try to make these subjects dissappear for another person? In @LOCATION1, everyone has the right to freedom of speech and expression, but how can these freedoms be carried through if people remove these expressed ideas and beliefs from the shelves of the readers? We all have a right to make the decisions that affect our world and if this world is equally owned by everyone, then everyone's decisions are equally burdened by everyone. That being said, we all have the right to know the decisions, actions, and the concequencies of these decisions and actions that our people all create every single day. In conclusion, I believe that our world is harsh and also beautiful, and censoring aspects of it does a disservice to everyone. Being that of which it is, I believe it is every man's right to live and decide the way he wants to. No man should ever make another person's decisions for them. Everyone is resonsible for their own life and how their life affects other people. However, no one has responsibility to hide or change the world around us from any person, for it is the knowledge of the people that make the world what it is and it is the knowledge of the world that influences a person's decisions.
1276	4253	2	3	Katherine Paterson's work seems like a reminder that life moves forward, urging us to seize opportunities. Grab a book from the shelf, both for yourself and your children, because these resources may disappear as others claim them. I would visit the library and find books for my kids. A mother can find educational books, perhaps covering the parts of the body or grammar, enabling early learning as they begin forming sentences. In [DATE1] at Warsaw school, the principal removed the library's contents due to low usage of books, music, movies, and magazines. Items sat in observation, unused. Why weren't parents borrowing materials to read and educate their children? Personally, as principal, I would have preserved the library, encouraging book selection and reading, fostering valuable learning experiences shared between mothers and their children. This way, the kids will get to learn something special from their mom.
1277	4254	2	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I have found that there has been a strong censorship in the libraries and I would like to express my strong disagreement for these actions. I have found that things have been removed from your shelves due to its content. Some of the content is vulgar and explicit and some is very offensive, but that still does not give you the right to remove these things. Books, movies, music, and magazines are very big parts of peoples lives and removing these things can be a big part of someones development. First off you should not be taking books off of shelves for any means. There is a reason these books have been written and published and it is because they have some meaning and can teach people or give them information on things they would not know otherwise. Taking books off shelves is pretty much just sheltering people, mostly kids, from information that would benefit them no matter in what way. Yes some books talk about sex, and yes some books have offensive terms but unless children are exposed to things like this they will not know that it is wrong. If they do not read books about how slaves were treated, they will never know about the slaves. If they never read a book about a married woman having an affair, they won't understand the significance of cheating. When people read these things they learn about them, and with a little common sense they can understand these things are wrong. Books should not be taken off the shelves in a @CAPS1 at any rate and movies should be looked at in the same manner.  Movies now a days have come along way. Flicks like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 use such a high form of technology that people would have no idea how it was done just a few decades ago. Some movies do contain very vulgar language and offensive terms and sometimes even nudity, and I can relate to not wanting a little child to see that. This does not mean that these things should be removed from the @CAPS1 though. In all honesty I do not want my little brother or sister walking past a @CAPS5 container with a picture of a girl in lingerie on the front and I do not think anyone else is ok with that. Other movies should be put on display for kids to rent though. Movies that can teach them history although there is very graphic content. Movies that will help them learn how not to do somethings like kill or rape. Movies that can show these things but also teach how incredibly horrible these things are at the same time. I think that the movies that go past this should be put into an adult only section and I do not think any pornography should be put on display anywhere, but movies need to be available to a very high extent. Movies are very good teaching tools and magazines follow that same path.  In the world today we have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1 that are jam packed with information that can better kids from a young age to even people who have been out of school for a while. I feel like some educational magazines @MONTH1 be graphic and show things that children should not see but on the other hand, seeing it will help them understand. Now I am not saying I want to put @CAPS6 magazines on display for people to see and learn about how little of clothes some girls can wear but magazines that @MONTH1 show the very little amount of clothes people are forced to wear in countries in @LOCATION1. They should be able to view magazines that could show, a little more on the nude side, of people who are starving because they only can eat twice a week. Things like this although can be very offensive maybe to some people should be viewed because it can teach. It will show kids that these people need help and they can be those people that help them. Once again pornography should not be available at anytime but other magazines that have an educational aproach but could contain some naughty things due to the teaching should be able to be heard. Magazines should be available but on the other hand you have to take a more careful approach to music.  Music is probably the hardest to figure out, of these censored things I have spoken of today. People use music to express feelings. Whether those feelings are good or bad they get them out through song. Music is something that brings people together and allows them to be unique at the same time. Music should not be taken away from people going into a @CAPS1 because of its vulgar content or anything of that matter. There is a thing called the 'clean' version of pretty much any song that has curse words in it. Songs that cannot be cleaned up or are not available in that way I can understand why they are taken off the shelves but other than that I think everything should be made available. Music can be so powerful to people and taking it away is not the right thing to do.  In conclusion the censorship should not be done. Yes there are somethings that have
1278	4255	2	3	Have you ever been reading something that made you mad? Well, to be honest I can't remember the last time I walked into a library and found something there that could have offended somebody. But that's just me, I'm sure that there is stuff out there that could really get to a person. No, I don't think that materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. People go to libraries to find out information on stuff that they don't know. If you are checking something out then you already know that there is a possibility of encountering something that you don't agree with. I don't think it should be anybody's business other than the person checking it out. Now, I'm not the type to get all frustrated or upset from something that I have seen on a shelf, but I can imagine that there are people out there who are like that. If I had found something that I disagreed with I would not read it or just think nothing of it. I also think that you should be prepared before walking into a public place where they have all kinds of reading material. To you it might be offensive, but to others it's hilarious. All I'm trying to say is just don't get all upset over something that you have read; instead, recognize that diverse perspectives exist, and it's okay to disagree with them without demanding censorship.
1279	4256	2	3	I believe books are written with purpose, each word intentionally chosen to contribute to the overall message. While I acknowledge the potential for certain words to be offensive, I also believe censoring books with offensive wording alters the author's intended meaning. Removing books from the market entirely feels excessive, because changing the wording, while intended to be less hurtful, could be seen as changing the book itself. It's wrong to include offensive language, but it's also wrong to assume everyone will be offended by it. Authors likely don't intend to cause harm, even when their words do. Some readers understandably struggle with offensive content, perhaps due to past trauma or personal sensitivities, and they should feel empowered to stop reading if they encounter triggering material. Taking a book away because of a single disliked word seems unfair, especially when others are unaffected. A better approach would be to include a warning on the book's cover or back, alerting potential readers to the presence of potentially offensive language. This allows individuals to make informed decisions about what they choose to read, since judging a book solely by its cover can be misleading. Ultimately, it feels like I hold opposing views, acknowledging the harm offensive language can cause while also defending the importance of preserving an author's original work and allowing readers to choose for themselves.
1280	4257	2	3	Libraries are a center of learning. They are there to provide all kinds of different information. So why should you take out offensive material? Even before internet, the all knowing source, people depended on the library for research. I do not think that things should be taken out of our library. Public libraries have always had a good censorship about what they put on their shelves anyway. As Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf, that work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' As she is saying there is, everybody has a certain opinion, they might take offense to different things. Therefore, if anyone could have the right to take a book off the shelf that they found offensive, then we wouldn't have any books on our shelves. If we would travel back to the time where internet was not invented, there would not be a problem on whether we should take certain books off the shelf. That's all they depended on. For example, research and entertainment. People today are spoiled. We can go right to a little screen and type in anything we want to know and we can find out just in minutes, sometimes even seconds. People don't even have to leave the house to go buy the latest movie that just came out, you can order it on the internet or even rent it from Netflix. If people are so worried about what is in the library, why don't they worry about all the explicit junk on the internet. Sometimes people can't see what's right in front of them. Everytime I go to the library and look through the books to find something to read, I rarely find a book that's worth questioning. Libraries are typically wholesome corporations, they have a good censorship on what they let on their shelves. They've always had certain age group sections, and usually people and kids always stick to their age groups. Every book I have chosen too, I've read it cover to cover. In conclusion, libraries have been around for ever. Their material provides research and appropriate entertainment for all ages. No matter if we ever had internet, we always had dependable libraries, offering a wealth of resources without the need for censorship.
1281	4258	2	3	"I think that no movie, Book, album, or any sort of music should ever be taken off the shelf; if you don't like what they say in these categories, don't watch, listen, read, or anything. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean somebody else doesn't. I mean, think about it: is there a movie or a song or a sentence that's so terrible that you need to take it off the shelf? I say no. Also, because somebody might have not got to read, see, or listen to that movie, song, or book, you know what I mean. Plus, all that money and time and hard work it took to make the song, book, or movie; it takes up to like almost three years for a movie to come out, and when a song comes out, you hardly even know it's new because they never tell you, like, ""Listen to Bullet for My Valentine's new song on MTV"" or anything, and when a new book comes out, it's usually like Harry Potter or something like that. But no, no movie should ever be taken off the shelves, nor book, nor music, nor magazine. The Entertainment Software Association should understand that censorship limits access and stifles creativity, ultimately harming society."
1282	4259	2	3	There are certain books, games, and music that you and I know that shouldn't be in the library or stores on the shelfs . One word that we should study, children. Children are the future, everything that happens in the future will be because of them. Now, with that done and said; I would like to explain, and point out why we as people of @ORGANIZATION1 should overcome together and take books, music, movies off the shelfs. Drugs, crime, violance, movies, and etc. Rappers most of the time rap about female, killing people, and etc. Its doesn't mean that they do it, but it reflects on majority of our children. Music is heard everyday @NUM1 hours throughout televison, radio, and i pods. Its take it to even an different level with to male gender. Calling female out of there name treating them how they were tought through music. If they not listening to it, they for sure watching it. Alot of the problems come from letting children watching the wrong rating movies. Rated @CAPS1 is want they our now letting children watch,and buy. So now its giving then a greater chance of failling life. So now we at two stikes with this stuff that we allowing our children to pick up off a shelf. #@NUM2 thing we let them pick up and grab is video games. @PERCENT1 of our children play video games. While the same time as we cant stop them making them, I strongly belive we can prevent from letting children buy them at the age level .Most of the games based on sex, drugs, violances, and languages. At this point children our taking it very serious, and strongly believing they can do the same. Which leading to death or jail. Drug use, school dropouts, and crime rates our highly because of these same video games children our getting off the shelf. Strongly influncing them to grown up fast, skip over the childhood life. So why can't we do it? I don't understand why we can't do it, when we have the power to. It will help us out so much for everybody future. Crime rate will go down, test scores will aprove, and our future will be brighter, showing we can build a better tommorow. For our sake, and our children.
1283	4260	2	3	Let's say you walk into a public library and you look upon a book that is racist or is offensive to you. You believe that the book shouldn't be on the shelf so you take it off. I believe that you have the right to take that book off the shelf. It isn't just books either; it can be music, movies, magazine, or many others. The authors have the right of freedom of speech but it can go the other way around too. There are many reasons why and I will explain this to you.  The first reason why is that the person might not come back to that place. I mean if somebody walks into a library and trys to find a book to read, do you think they will ever come back if they are offended by one? A little while back, I was in the library and I noticed a book that was offending. It was talking jokes about black people. I believe that isn't right because all people are equal no matter how they look or what they believe. Libraries should be welcoming spaces for everyone in the community.  The next reason is that it could cause rate of the materials to go down. If somebody gets offensive about a censored material, they are going to report it and cause the rate to drop low. No library wants to hold books, music, movies, or magazines that have been reported by their community and nobody wants it. How would the author feel about their material getting reported because of somebody getting offensive by it? If the author wants to offend anybody, then they shouldn't even bother to publish it. Negative reviews and complaints can significantly impact the popularity and circulation of library materials.  The last reason is to get rid of the materials. Nobody wants to look at something that offends them. How would you feel that you took a movie home to watch the family and it had bad stuff in it and you didnt like it. You get offended and complain. Complaining is bad for business especially if its a government building. If we just get rid of the things that offend people, then we wouldn't have any problems. Avoiding potentially offensive content can lead to a more harmonious environment.  I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelf if sombody if offended by it. There are really three main reasons. One is the the person might never come back to that place. Next, is that it could cause rate success drop down low. The last is to just get rid of the materials so they are no complains. Now, what do you believe? By removing offensive materials, libraries can avoid alienating patrons, maintain positive reputations, and foster a more inclusive environment for all.
1284	4261	2	3	I believe that censorship within libraries and any other public media source is wrong, immoral, and unfair. Authors, artists, photographers, etc. have the right to freedom of speech. Why should the consumers not have the same right to choose what they expose themselves to? The censorship of any media should not be allowed in public consumer spots, not only because it goes against basic american rights, but it also takes the responsibility, originality, and expression out of PEOPLE'S lives. If a parent or guardian did not wish for their child to be exposed to certain genres of certain media, isn't it their responsibility to intercept that from their child's environment? If a parent really abhors a certain genre, then it is up to that parent to create a surrounding in which they feel that their child is safe. It is understandable that some genres of music, magazines, books and movies contain material that MAY be too graphic or mature for readers of a certain age, but situations like this in today's world are unavoidable. In my experience, I know that when I was too young to understand the happenings of 9/11, my parents intercepted the stories from me. My parents turned off graphic or violent television when I walked in the room. They felt that this sort of material was inappropriate for someone at age 7, so they excerpted that material from my environment. When you become a parent, you take on responsibility for the life of another person. This responsibility includes the child’s health, safety, and his/her surroundings. Why can't AMERICA leave the parenting of children to the parents? When children turn into teenagers and teenagers become adults, they earn many privileges. They earn the right to drive, then the right to vote, then the right to drink responsibly. There is a maturity level that goes into making decisions on your own; if you are mature enough to decide who you want to run your country, how could you not be mature enough to decide something as insignificant as music choice? Authors, artists, composers, and photographers, all by living in AMERICA, all have the right to the freedom of speech and freedom of expression. By censoring what products are published and put in public takes away that right. Some MAY argue that the artists and authors still have the right to express themselves, but they are expressing material that is too risque or graphic to promote. This is an understandable point, but who is the government to promote only what they want to promote? Why should the government have total control over what PEOPLE are exposed to? If this were to happen, could it easily be taken too far by power hungry politicians? Wouldn't AMERICA no longer be a democracy, but rather a communist country, like CHINA? American prides itself in being a 'mixing pot', and being accepting. If AMERICA were to be like CHINA, that would mean the restriction of expression and originality throughout the country. Would you really want to live in a country where originality isn't really original, and acceptance was only what the government decided was acceptable? Would you be proud to live in a place where people don't have the opportunity to express themselves to others freely? I wouldn't. Although the censorship of media through a library is only on a small scale, but censorship is censorship. It is discrimination against composers of a certain genre of works. It is the removal of choice from PEOPLE'S lives. It is denying the composers their right to freedom of speech. Whichever way you look at it, censorship is censorship, and censorship is wrong. Therefore, we must fight against the suppression of ideas and ensure that all voices have the opportunity to be heard.
1285	4262	2	3	Lots of people come to the library to check out books, music, movies, and other things for entertainment. Mainly children use the library more than any other age group. The library is a place where you can be humble and relaxed. No one wants to check out things that are offensive in any type of way, or even books that will influence bad things. Therefore certain things shouldn't be allowed to be checked out in libraries. Certain movies shouldn't be in the library. For example, if a child goes to the library they might see a movie that contains sexual activity and decide to check the movie out. The kid might be underage and the movie would be considered inappropriate. The child might get in trouble by their guardian. In reality, it would be the librarian's fault for letting the child check the movie out. That is why the movies should be censored for age appropriateness. On the cover of many magazines women as well as men's bodies are exposed. That might cause children to be attracted to the magazine. They might even decide to check the magazine out. Children are influenced by the things they see. Seeing exposed bodies would be considered setting a bad example. In today's world all children listen to music, and the music you listen to has a huge impact on your life. The music in libraries should be censored. Libraries should have music that encourages you to go out and be something in life. In my opinion, only influential music should be able to be rented out. Reading is the key to success. Libraries should have books that will help you increase your vocabulary as well as educate you, not the books that will talk about sexual things or even make you wonder about sex. Libraries should only have history, math, and educational books available. In conclusion, everything in the library should be censored to some degree. A lot of children use the library. Therefore it should be age appropriate, and no child needs to be put under a bad influence, so certain things should be removed from the shelves to keep down less confusion and provide a safe environment.
1286	4263	2	3	I think that movies and magazines should be removed from the shelf because they might have some stuff in it that little kids could look at or watch. The movies and magazines will sometimes give some kids some ideas and the books should be removed because it had some words that people will be saying and the music should be removed because they have rap music. People shouldn't be listening to it. The music is sometimes not appropiate for all age and it can give people some ideas of what they say or do. The books and magazines can give people some ideas of what they say or do and they can believe anything of what they say. People should be reading good books and reading good magazines and listen to some good music. They are all offensive because they talk about bad stuff and doing bad stuff or talk about how they live their lives. Peolpe shouldn't be listening to some rap music or read the magazines or read some books that will give other people some ideas. The books sometimes talking about what happened a long time ago and stuff like that and it sometimes offense people like that. The magazines sometimes tell people what happened in the past and thenpeople don't want to read any magzines anymore. The people don't want to listen to any music anymore or read any books anymore. Most people will think that most books, magazines, and music are bad for the kids and for the adults. I think that it is offensive because music is not a good thing to listen to like rap or hip-hop. The people shouldn't be listening to rock music and they should just listen to some music that are appropiate. The books should be appropiate for all age and they should read something that they like. They should read some magazines that they like and that are good and appropiate. The music is offensive because they talk about inapproiate stuff and they shouldn't be listening to it and the magazines have some inappropiate stuff and the books have some inappropiate stuff. The people won't like it and they might not want to check it out again or they won't check nothing out. I think that they should put some books on the shelves that people will like and the music that people will like, ensuring it's suitable for everyone. They should put some magazines on the shelves that people will want to look at or read, providing positive and enjoyable content. Ultimately, choosing appropriate and enjoyable media is key for a positive experience.
1287	4264	2	3	i fell that this test is stupid i hate reading and writing. i think that you all should only make sure that we can read on level and write on level bc alot of kids arn't even going to really try on this test till like their @NUM1 or @NUM2 grade year and also alot of teachers dont even teach this material till the end of the year so i think that some of the stuff that u all test on should be changed like the stuff you test on and how long the test is and should be more focest on reading and writing levels however i do agree that the test should still be here because it helps felter people who passed the class by cheating and who passed it by hard work i think there should be an alternative test that is taken on paper to because some kids test better on paper then on a computer this is the way i feel about the test. i know i was supose to write about offensive material but i couldnt think how i felt about it and this is the stuff that was on my mid so i thought i would enform u think you very much. I hope these changes can be considered to make the test more effective and fair for all students, even those who struggle with reading and writing.

1289	4266	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I have been through some different libraries lately to see what other kind of information they had. I am also afraid to tell you that i have seen a censorship problem with our public libraries. I can understand why they might censor some of the more mature/graphic novels because of the children going in and out of the library all day, but, i do not believe that everyone else shouldnt be able to get the books they want because of content issues. One reason why i think there shouldnt be censorship in libraries is because some people need to find information on certain topics and there might not be any reliable information on it on the internet. If students in highschool or college dont have the information they need to write a paper or do a project for their classes then their grade could drop and also they could fall behind in work becauase theyre trying to catch up to where everybody else in their class are working. Another reason I think censorship in our libraries is because some of the things they censor could be the only copy of the book or the only one thats close to where you live. If they censor the one book that you need then that could possibly ruin the whole book for them. I believe that if a person is over the age of @NUM1, they should be able to take out any book they want and have it be uncensored. Some people @MONTH1 take offense to some things written in these books, but if they dont like something, they shouldnt check it out in the first place. There are plenty of people around this world that have interest in millions apon millions of different topics. Also, some people @MONTH1 not be able to reasearch or explore their topics as much as they would like to because of the censorship problem in public libraries. If people could learn more about their interests they could go on to bigger and better things or maybe even just get a little bit smarter. This lack of access can stifle intellectual curiosity and limit opportunities for personal growth. In conclusion, I believe that censorship in libraries should be banned because of the problems it can cause and the effect it has on people. Censorship is a problem that needs to be dealt with as quickly and effecintly as possible, so everyone has equal access to information.
1290	4267	2	3	Imagine a library without any materials that are considered offensive. In this library you wouldn't find many of the great pieces of literature that have impacted and influenced society today. You probably wouldn't find too many books, magazines, or movies that everyone in the community feels are appropriate. Some of the great classic novels have contents that could be considered offensive to many people. Offensive materials should remain in libraries today because something that is offensive to one person might not be to another person, who could be impacted by the piece of literature that is being banned. Music should also remain in libraries because the artist did not put the lyrics in the song to bring the listeners attention to the offensive material. Also offensive materials have made an impact in society for ages. First, materials that one individual finds offensive could be viewed another way by many others who enjoy the material. Some comedy and action movies are viewed as offensive or inappropriate to some people, but many others currently enjoy the movie. If a movie, book, or magazine has the topic of racism, sexism, discrimination, it could be considered offensive to people who were a part of it, but it could also inform the reader or the person who is watching about the events that happened. If children want to see or read this material they should get permission from their parents first. Next, all music should remain in libraries. The music was created by an artist who made it for enjoyment and entertainment. The purpose of the music is not to bring the attention of offensive material to the listeners. The lyrics in some songs are innapropriate for children, but parents should not let their child listen to them. Lyrics can deal with really mature things that should only be heard and understood by adults. Last, offensive materials have impacted society for ages. Many things the founding fathers of the United States did were considered offensive, but that did not make them wrong, and it made the community a better place today. Offensive materials impact everyday life for better and worse. If all offensive materials were banned, they wouldn't be able to have an impact on society for better. In conclusion, offensive materials should remain in libraries today. The materials currently be controversial, but they still are pieces of literature that deserve to be read and studied by the people of the community. Offensive materials contain many teaching tools in life that could help out the lives of many people. The community would turn into that of the community in Ray Bradbury's novel Fahrenheit 451, where all books were burned and society was not intellegent at all, if offensive materials were taken out of libraries today, leading to an uninformed and ignorant society.
1291	4268	2	3	I think that some books should be banned from libraries that are offensive or use certain words against people, I think that should apply to highschool libraries because it really would matter less in elementaries because they wouldn't know what some things mean. If a class were to read an offensive book and someone in the class from the opposite race that reads the book others could get offended and it could start a fight. Some high schoolers could get offended quicker than others and which could cause a lot of problems so by avoiding that there should be votes on books that should be banned or not be allowed to be read in class or in school period. This voting process could involve students, teachers, and parents to ensure a fair decision. I'm pretty sure people would think its dumb to ban books but trust it me it would solve a lot of problems, but it all comes down to what's acceptable and what's not without hurting other people's feelings and putting them down. I bet all the time in classes there's been a story that has been read that has talked about races which makes others not feel comfortable, and there's always that person that always tries to make fun of something, but if I were in this situation I would try my best to not let others get to me and interfere with my grades and performance. I would just ignore them as much as possible and if it did start getting annoying I would talk to my counselor about trying to talk to that person individually or just removing me from class. I'm pretty sure most schools wouldn't tolerate this type of behavior but you will always have those kind of kids you just have to ignore. You should never not go to school thinking you don't fit in just because someone is making fun of your race or how you look. They just try to make the day harder on you and all you have to do is ignore them or report it and hopefully it is taken care of, ultimately creating a more inclusive and comfortable learning environment for everyone.
1292	4269	2	3	Censorship in libraries differ in certain areas. I personally love reading, and like all kinds of books. And I know that there are some books that I have read that my parents would not aprove of. But has that ever stopped me? Not exactly. I think that after a certain age, people should be aloud to read whatever they want. I mean, if I ever thought I could not be mature enough to read a certain book. Then I will not get or read the book, it is that simple. As far as music, movies, and magazines go that could be a different story. Music is for the most part like a book, just using a different one of your senses. And it is listened to, not read. Movies should be judged a little more carefully in my eyes, because movies are like show and tell. That could easily go wrong if children, teens, etc take it more than just a movie. Movies can have a stronger impact due to their visual nature. I think all things should not be judged by assumption. Everyone has different opinions and likes. So, therefore material should not be removed from shelves, if there are people that like/support what the book, movie, or music has to offer. Considering individual maturity and preferences is essential when determining access to different forms of media, and blanket censorship deprives individuals of choice and the opportunity to form their own opinions.
1293	4270	2	3	What's your first thought when you're thinking about a library? Is it quiet, peace, or calm? Many people would think that until they come opon a certain book, magazine, movie, etc. They would start reading, and soon read something that is completely offensive. Books, magazines, movies, etc. should be censored and removed from a library if found offensive. Although everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I believe that a library is a place of peace. Having offensive literature in a library makes it look as though it's a bit trashy. If people want to read a certain magazine or book that offends a large sum of people, then they should go somewhere besides a library to find it. When I was younger, I participated in events at our local library; such as seeing who could read the most books over a certain amount of time, or other events like that. I liked to explore the library and find new things. I remember back then, and still today, there were always a large amount of magazines sitting on selfs, categorized into their correct sections. Many of them showing half-dressed women and men. Now, I understand that people like to know what is going on in the real world and like to be up to date, but I believe that they can go elsewhere to find such magazines. Having these offensive magazines in libraries for children to see is not good, and could easliy upset the parents of the children. Another reason why books, magazines, and others should be censored is because they can influence teens to do wrong and/or bad things. For example, many books talk about drugs and smoking. If teens read this, they might start thinking that it isn't wrong to do these things. If these type of books were to be removed from libraries, then I believe that the number of bad things that teens are influenced by would be greatly decreased because they aren't going to read them. Limiting access to materials that promote harmful behavior can help protect young people. In my personal opinion, libraries would be better if books, magazines, movies, etc. would be censored. Not only would it make people happier, it would make the world better. Besides, if you are looking to read something bad, you shouldn't be looking in a library anyway! Therefore, censoring offensive materials in libraries would enhance the overall atmosphere and protect vulnerable individuals from potentially negative influences.
1294	4271	2	3	My views on censorship are strong. I think that if a book, movie, etc., is discriminating towards one or more groups of people, then I think that people should have the right to at least have a say in whether it should be on the shelves of a library or not. Although books could be discriminating too, if the book is about something that has happened in the past and is the past of our country, then I think that people should also have a say in keeping it on the shelves. If these materials are using offensive language or actions to harm or discriminate against that race, then they should be taken off of the shelves. If they are part of the history of the world or of our country, then I think that they should be left there for future generations to learn about it and to know that these things happened. Most materials don't try to discriminate any race, and if they did, then I don't think it would be in the library in the first place. For me, censorship could go both ways. It really just depends on the situation and the material. Someone could have an opinion that it is offensive, but that doesn't mean that is a fact. If the book is popular in the library and a lot of people like to come in and read it, then I don't think I would remove the book. People view offensive writing and actions differently from one another. So, I think it depends on the situation. If I was a parent these days, I would let my child read one of these so called offensive books if it was part of the past for our country. My intentions for letting him read it are for all the right reasons. I don't attend to let him read it so that he can act upon the things told about in the book. I would let him read it to learn about the past. I think it is a positive thing for children to know about the past and to engage in critical thinking. So, in my perspective, censorship depends on the situation and the material. These are only my views on the topic, and also these statements are my opinion. So, I can't really say if I am for censorship or not; my stance is nuanced and context-dependent.
1295	4272	2	3	No, I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive for many reasons. If anybody could take books off the shelves in the libraries, there would no longer be any use for libraries, students in school will have a harder time learning about certain topics in the world, it would defeat the purpose of having the ability of freedom of speech, we could easily avoid this problem if needed. One reason I believe that taking books off the shelves is wrong is because, if we all have the right to take books we find offensive, there would no longer be any books on the shelves. This would limit the ability for students to learn about many important topics in the world. Just the other day I heard a lady telling her daughter that she was not going to allow her to go to school the day they have 'the talk' (sex education for students in grade six), because she thought she was too young to learn about that area of education. Yes, that may be true, but it also means that her daughter is not going to know about the many diseases you can get from underage, and or unprotected sex. This could lead her daughter to having sex at a young age and getting pregnant, or some kind of disease, that could have easily been prevented with a little education from library books, or a class at school. Another reason I do not believe in the right of taking books from the shelves is because, when we are taking these books off the shelves, we are taking someone's very hard work and just throwing it into the trash. In my opinion it is very disrespectful to the authors, and anybody else who was involved in writing those books. Just because you do not agree with what they are writing does not mean you can just throw it away. This would be defeating the purpose of having freedom of speech. Taking those books off the shelves is basically telling the authors that they are not allowed to write about what they want and publish it. It is also telling them that they are not allow to state their opinion. This problem could easily be avoided if needed. For example, those books, music pieces, movies, magazines, etc., could be put in a separate section of the library, and only make it available to adults of a certain age. Have the books, and other writing pieces rated in the same way that movies are. This would be a very simple and effective way to solve this problem. Like I mentioned earlier I strongly disagree with giving citizens the right to take certain materials, such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., off the shelves if you or anyone else find them offensive because it could affect the community in many ways, it is very rude and disrespectful to the author of that piece of writing, and there are simple solutions to this problem. Therefore, censorship through removal is not the answer; instead, we should focus on providing context, guidance, and options for responsible access.
1296	4273	2	3	Yes, I believe that books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed off the shelf if they are offensive and inappropriate. People should have the freedom of speech but not in an offensive manner. If people want to have their things shown, such as movies, or heard, such as music, it should be appropriate. Just because other people are doing it doesn't make it right. Some people have little sense of knowledge not to do the things that the movies, or songs say to do. Most people like the songs because it says to do bad things; they just want to be heard, or want attention. When I listened to music or watched movies, I got the same ideas as other kids my age and younger. I did stupid stuff because I thought that it was right. People just want to get their voice out there, and to be heard, especially if they feel marginalized or misunderstood.  I learned to get my voice heard; I needed to do it in an appropriate manner. Some artists or actors don't want to convey these kinds of things to kids, but the only way to get their stuff out to the public is to make it offensive; for example, they might feel pressure to sensationalize their work to gain attention.  I stopped reading and watching this stuff because I learned the hard way, and the only way that I will be heard is to say and do the appropriate stuff. The way I look at things is that content should be suitable and not promote harmful behavior, especially to impressionable audiences.
1297	4274	2	3	Censorship has been around for awhile and a lot of people agree that there should be censorship on a lot of things like telivision, books, magazines, almost about everything. Some people are going a little bit too far when it comes to older teens. There not little kids and they shouldn't have things censored. Like when you go to see a rated R movie and you have to be with an adult to watch that movie. For little kids I think that they should have things censored because there young. They just dont need to be hearing bad language and anything. Parents should also care about what there child hears or reads if there young. Some parents don't even care what they see or hear and they end up getting in trouble with there teachers if they say it. It seems like the younger kids are always learning bad language or bad habits and I think its sad because they shouldn't be around that. They pick up alot of stuff when there young so your like a role model for them. I believe that older teens like 16 and 17 are more mature about this, if they read a book in the library that might have a bad word. Im sure they hear it all the time on the bus or when your in town. They going to hear it anyways so why try to stop it when there going to end up hearing it. Books are suppose to help you and give you the real thing. You can't just throw out books or censor them because they may contain controversial topics. Everybody has there different opinion and this is my opinion. When you get at a certain age you start to mature and realize those are bad things to say or do so I believe high school books or magazines or anything else shouldn't be censored, as older teens are capable of discerning appropriate behavior and understanding different perspectives.
1298	4275	2	3	Imagine discovering that your favorite book or movie has vanished from every public library, deemed offensive and removed from circulation. Wouldn't that be frustrating? Especially if you've read or watched it yourself and found no objectionable content. While some materials are unsuitable for children, outright removal seems excessive. There are alternative solutions that could potentially satisfy everyone involved.  One option is to restrict access to potentially offensive material. By keeping such items under the librarian's control, children couldn't simply access them independently. The librarian could then assess whether an individual, regardless of age, is mature enough to view the material. Another possibility is a separate facility specifically for adult content. Requiring identification and a library card for entry would ensure that only adults access materials deemed inappropriate for minors.  Parental permission is another viable solution. When a child obtains a library card, a parent or guardian could complete an application specifying what the child is allowed to check out.  Removing books, movies, or music from shelves is a direct violation of the First Amendment and free speech. Allowing censorship opens the door to restricting every right we possess. Preventing specific age groups from accessing certain materials is crucial, and the proposed alternatives would address these concerns effectively if implemented. These are good altercations to prevent this from happening if only we take the steps to accomplish them These solutions offer practical ways to balance freedom of access with responsible protection of younger audiences, ensuring that censorship doesn't become the norm and everyone's rights are respected.
1299	4276	2	3	What other people take as offensive might be taken to others as something they value. I believe that all sorts of books, music, and magazines should stay on the shelves at the library. People value many different things and we need to give others an opportunity to explore what else there is. Different types of books explain different types of things. Some people connect with books in a way that others might not understand. Taking certain types of books away can risk other peoples feelings. Taking music, in my opinion, would be the worst because people get lost in some types of music. They use music to escape their problems and taking that away can leave them helpless. People love movies; it helps people understand what is going on in other peoples point of views. Taking away movies could leave people with no entertainment. People like different movies and some movies can be offensive, but, it's not up to anybody else. Magazines help people keep up with news. Most of the news can be very offensive; it is the people around you causing the offensive news. Taking away magazines can be keeping people from the latest gossip and news. Taking away things that people use to connect with, what they use to escape with, their entertainment, and the news would most likely cause people to act out in a bad way. Everybody is different and everybody likes different things, and taking away something that others think is offensive is unfair to the people that think it isn't. What if somebody thought what you liked was inappropriate? How would you feel? Therefore, we must respect diverse tastes and allow access to a wide range of materials, even those considered offensive by some, to ensure freedom of expression and personal exploration for all.
1300	4277	2	3	'The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2', 'The @CAPS3 @CAPS4', 'The @CAPS5 of @PERSON2'. Do these titles sound familiar? They should, because these are only a tiny fraction of the @CAPS3 literary masterpeices that people have enjoyed since their publications. These wonderful books also share another characteristic, they have all been banned from certain libraries across the country and around the world. When a child goes off to school each day, his or her parents are left to think that he or she will be getting a quality education that meets the stadards of their own core values and morals. But certain parents @MONTH1 become outraged when they see the books shelved on schools library shelves that they see as wrong, and don't want their precious children exposed to such immoral concepts that go against their idea of what is right. In all reality though, how is this helping anyone? By keeping a student away from a book or subject, the person causing the censorship is limiting what that student can learn. By censoring things people are not only kept from ideas that might shock them, but also from ideas that might make them think. If a person cannot think for themselves, they cannot draw their own conclusions on things. When one cannot think for oneself or make decisios for oneself, how can this person be considered a free individual. Infamous dictators, such as @PERSON1, burned books to keep his citizens from thinking what he did not want them to think. By banning a book in a school library, a parent is also keeping their child from thinking what they do not want them to think. And when you want a book out of a shool library you are ot only keepig your child from reading this book, but everyone who goes to the school from reading the book. How is that fair? So instead of wanting certain books to be off the shelves of your childs school, I say this. Teach your children to be careful in what they read. If you don't wan them to read 'The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2' tell them not to read that book. Tell your children to follow the moral guidelines you want them to follow, and if certain books keep them from having their own thoughs instead of yours, just tell them not to look, and don't bother everyoe else about it, allowing everyone the freedom to explore diverse perspectives and form their own informed opinions.
1301	4278	2	3	Certain books should be removed from the library because of the materials and the stuff they show to younger children. One reason they should take those books off is because some of them are racist against some cultures. Another reason is that some of the books or movies etc., would have things in them that young children shouldn't be looking at or reading. A final reason is that some books just shouldn't be in the libraries at all. The first reason was that the books should be taken out of the library is because they're racist. They should take them off because they can teach young children the wrong things, especially regarding how they perceive and interact with others. Also, they can teach the children how to treat people differently because they're reading those books from the library. They would also get the wrong idea about people and different cultures, fostering prejudice instead of understanding. Second reason why they should get rid of that bad stuff in the libraries is because they would have things in there that young children should not be watching or reading. Like, they shouldn't have movies with killing and drug dealing or about drinking or anything a child shouldn't be looking at. It gives the children the wrong idea, and they will think it's okay because they saw it in the movies or read it in a book. A more curated selection would protect their innocence. Final reason is that they shouldn't just have those things in a library at all or should just have a place for where the young kids can't use them. Or they would need a parent or somebody that's eighteen so they wouldn't be able to just get these bad books or movies. This would ensure responsible access. In conclusion, libraries shouldn't have books or music or magazines or movies in them at all that are inappropriate for children. They give kids wrong ideas and make them think that it's cool or the right thing to do 'cause they saw it in a movie or read it in a book, but that doesn't make it the right thing to do; that's why they should get rid of that stuff.
1302	4279	2	3	Keep it on the shelves. The reason for libraries is so that people can read what they want to read. If I owned a library I would have everything on the shelves because there are a lot of people and not everyone likes the same thing. Truthfully I wouldn't care because it isn't just about a handful of people it is about everyone's feelings. If people started taking certain things out of their bookstores and libraries it would eventually get out of hand. The reason it would get out of hand is because a certain topic like slavery – if someone wanted to learn about it or enjoyed reading topics like that, it wouldn't be fair because *some* people might find it offensive to put stuff out there for the public like that.  Everyone has their own opinion, but why express your own opinion if the subject you want to express it under isn't harming anyone physically or emotionally? If everyone's opinion was heard and taken into consideration the world as we know it would be boring and outrageous. People like action and adventures, others like laid back kind of stuff. Why take things from people that they have had for a very long time if it's just going to start a conflict and change the way people live everyday life. Maybe it could turn out in a good way but really what are the chances of that – one billion to a thousand.  Things that are offensive to some people are very interesting to others, so keep everything on the shelves. If only certain people are going to complain about it, it's not really a big deal. Maybe someday when everyone in the world agrees on *the same* reasoning then we could change it, but I really don't see that happening anytime soon. The main reason is there is always going to be conflict between three or more groups of people. Everyone can't be happy at the same time, so I say who cares whether something offends someone or not; that's their opinion, and it can stay on the shelf for the people that actually enjoy that kind of stuff until a lot more people are seeing it differently, allowing everyone to have access to diverse viewpoints and reading materials.
1303	4280	2	3	Books? Movies? Music? Magazines? We all like to read them, watch them, and listen to them. It's hard to stop all that. Plus, it's impossible to stop. Everywhere you go you can find these items. Such as the movie store, the mall, a gas station, a yard sale, and even your public library. People of all ages can go anywhere and get a book, movie, a song, or a magazine and it's perfectly fine. But, there is one problem. Censorship. Yes that's what i said, 'censorship.' It means alot to some parents when it comes to their children. Espescially when it comes to the public library where they live. If a parent wants to take their kids to the library and get some books or movies or ect. that's okay but if a parent has to worry about a movie or magazine has 'bad things' in it that children shouldn't see is a problem. They want to be able to enjoy the movie or song or magazine with their children but bad things like nudity, violence, racial pictures, or profanity can be really offensive to parents AND people alone, just not parents. A lot of these examples can be offensive to anyone or everyone and censorship is a pretty good idea. There is no way if I was a parent that I would want my kids to look at or watch or read any 'bad things' because we all know that is not right. Kids are young and don't need to be learning about that stuff at a young age. I think censoring is a really great idea and I think Libraries and other places that have books, movies, music, magazines, ect. should censorize there things. But if they wont censorize anything they should at least put them in catagories such as 'adults' or 'young adults' or 'kids'. If they catagorize the ratings then the parents and you know where to look for and don't have to worry about censorship. Censorship should be practiced everywhere, and implementing categories is a practical way to address concerns without completely restricting access.
1304	4281	2	3	Corrupt Censorship @CAPS1 @MONTH1 occur when censorship decides to remove or block; showing certain media or readable content all pertains to the creator. In some cases, the distributor and less the author, director, or publisher, has no opinion on whether to display the product they have made, but from their own habit of making what they enjoy; it is the will from the store, person or etc. to display these materials. Libraries have an exponential option to publicly put up on their shelves or stock, but restricting too graphic material is all depended on the eduacational rules the library is equipted with.  Any type of content is art, art that should never be even considered to be changed or enhanced because it pertains to one artist. You can never remake, rewrite or recreate that visual material provided from the creator. And you are not aloud to, unless given permission to from the creator. Censoring or removing on the other hand, is permitted to the distributor. Their choice to publicly demonstrate something made by someone is all their choice.  Libraries for example, show that any given media or readable content is publicly displayed for anyone to see, so long as the audience fits their rules or criterias. In some instances, partial side of the audience will run across unexpected media and will have the inexecptional pursuasion to accept what is demonstrated. Though it is not the creators fault to ensure where their content is diplayed, but the audience's fault in whether to see that material. It is choice to read or see whatever you'd like, you aren't forced upon to follow through to what the distributor-let alone the creator- is offering. Enjoying the topic or material is optional.  When you have options in front of you, any given topics or subject to read or follow, it it your will to chose to read or see them. Enjoying is even more harder, but when a library's limit is basically the sky, you should not force it on them to throw out the book just because the censorship isnt up to your level. It is not the library to blame, but your own. Everyone has different views on certain content and it isnt your obligation to view it.  When you take down materials @CAPS2 intended for those who chose to view and enjoy, you destroy not @CAPS2 art a creator has made, but the joy that filled a viewers taste. Libraries shouldn't exceptionalize for certain people's expectations because not everyone finds censorship a solution. Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so deos everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Therefore, the key is to respect individual choices and avoid imposing censorship based on personal preferences, as it ultimately limits access to diverse perspectives and artistic expressions for everyone.
1305	4282	2	3	Nowadays, people can get offended over anything. In these trying times, readers, listeners, and even writers, seem to prioritize their own agendas over the consumer's desires. Even if some stories, books, or articles are completely bogus, it shouldn't matter; don't let others' opinions ruin it for everyone else. Many people get offended nowadays over absolutely nothing, and they feel the need to do something about it, which necessarily isn't a bad thing, but isn't a good thing either. It is freedom of speech, or so that's what the Constitution says, meaning folks have the right to read, write, or say anything they please. Fake and bogus writings are a small problem for readers and writers, although some might find them harmful. People are reading articles and books and believing every bit of what they read, write, or even hear on their radios in recent times. It is hard to believe anything nowadays because you never really know the facts unless you experience them yourself. Opinions are the big thing folks have to look out for, but still, that goes back to the freedom of speech. Reading and writing is a wonderful thing to do and has been around longer than any human will ever know. Just don't let other readers' opinions get in the way of a great thing, and allow yourself the chance to enjoy the written word for what it is, regardless of what others think.
1306	4283	2	3	Controversey and offensive content. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' (Katherine Paterson, Author.) Paterson makes a very valid point here. Right off the bat, I can think of many offensive or inappropriate books, movies, songs, and magazines. There are equal amounts of good and bad publications, and the decision of what is good or bad is very controversial. The creator of each song, movie, book, magazine, or any other publication has made their product for a specific customer. Playboy magazine was not created for five year olds, but for desperate sex-crazed men, and cartoons like Spongebob Squarepants and Blues Clues wasn't made for adults, but for young kids. Usually, the intended purpose of the product is not meant to be negative. It breaks my heart to hear of the rising amount of people of varrying ages getting into pornography. I think the whole idea of it is wrong, degrading, and utterly disgusting, but others firmly disagree. Some religions think the Harry Potter series is blasphemous evil, as others don't agree at all. Controversy fills everything in our culture. We all have our opinions and choices. Should I have the right to take away books from my child? My mother would not let me read the Goosebumps books when I was younger. She felt that it was from the devil and pure evil. That make me desire to read it even more than before. When I entered middle school, I read the books anyway: I had the ability to make my own choices. I didn't see the devil in the books. I actually felt the opposite feelings toward the book. The books reflected upon good vs. evil, which I saw as God vs. Satan. My opinions and views were very different than my mother's. If I would have read the books when I was younger, I might've thought differently. I think that my mom protected me from what could have been bad. I think it is perfectly fine to protect your kids by setting up rules and boundaries. Parents just need to be aware that once the kids are older, they will make the choices on their own. All in all, certain books will be in the kids section for a reason, and others will be in the adult section for other reasons. We must use our judgement and trust our kids to make good choices on what they allow to enter their brain and consume their thoughts, while also understanding that exposure to different viewpoints is a part of growing up.
1307	4284	2	3	No, I do not believe there should be any censorship in libraries. We have freedom of speech for a reason; this is a fundamental right. Sure, some materials might not be suitable for all individuals or particular age groups, but ultimately, everyone will inevitably encounter perspectives, content, or situations they may not appreciate, enjoy, or concur with. Shielding people entirely is impossible, and exposure to diverse viewpoints, even challenging ones, is essential for growth and understanding. Therefore, censorship in libraries is not the answer.
1308	4285	2	3	Do people take offensive books serious? There are lots of stuff in books that people in @MONTH1 think is offensive. Some other people in @MONTH1 think differently. I pretty sure libraries have censored shelves, but if not people shouldn't get so worried about it and here are ways. I feel that certain materials that young people see in books, music, and movies are at the library. They see stuff that's around them; they also see what there mentor and parents are doing/watching too. The author of the quote (Katherine Paterson) can't just blame it all on the library.  In the paragraph I wrote before this, I said that children see things that there metor and parents are doing. Now today in the @NUM1 century parents really don't keep a good eye things and what they leave out for what they child can get. Kids like to play with stuff they first see. If parents don't want there child seeing offensive material and other stuff on the shelves in a library then they should watch what they kids are doing more carefully and watch over their backs.  I really don't care that the shelves in libraries are offensive. I just don't pay any attention to it anyway. We are living in a better world that it was years ago. If people still are getting mad over petty stuff like that, then what are they still here for. When young children get older they are going to end up seeing things that they couldn't see that's still going to be on the shelves in a library.  We shoudn't take books offensive. After all they are just words on a piece of paper. I believe that offensive materials and other stuff should stay on the shelves of library. Besides, some people need to know the truth sometimes in order to understand stuff more clearly, so we should not restrict access to these materials.
1309	4286	2	3	"I think that the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves. If a book, magazine, movie, etc., is found offensive then you should just walk away and ignore it. Don't go back and keep looking at it because what you find offensive someone else might like. The world won't change around you so you should do the smart thing and ignore it. If something is found offensive regarding censorship in libraries then maybe it's not a good idea for you to be where you are in that library. And if something does offend you, you should still act appropriately and deal with the situation the right way. When I was younger I used to see books with a cover titled ""dirty"", ""nasty"", ""vulgar"", ""rude"", etc., and would think it was funny, but the adults didn't think so. The books are put there for people to read not just to look at. The books, music, movies, magazines are not there to offend you in any type of way. If you find something offensive then you should just move away from that area, so that you won't worry about having to be offended. Different people like different things, so they will have many different varieties to choose from in a library. They might have some things that really offend you or they might have some things that you really like. You have to make a wise choice and know that if something is going to offend you stay away from it. Censorship in libraries have every right to put up any and every piece of book, music, movie, magazine, etc., because it is in their facility. They shouldn't have to worry about people being offended by anything they put up. They shouldn't have to worry about people being offended because 99% of the time the things they put up are not bad at all, it might even be helpful, but to one person it might be harmful or offend them. In America, censorship in libraries should be able to post or shelve anything they want. If you're offended or not offended they have every right to shelve whatever it is, because in the real world you don't always get what you want, and you won't always like what you see, which is why personal choice and tolerance are so important in navigating diverse collections."
1310	4287	2	3	A library is a safe haven. A place people can go to escape the world and stick their head into a book. It is a place filled with knowledge and information. You can find information on anything in a library, from any point of view. Information in libraries should not be censored, even if the information is considered offensive. A library should not be biased. Removing certain information from a library would be biased to whatever group believes in that knowledge. Whether or not something is offensive, the information should be out there for one to learn about if he chooses. Having information in a library that might be offensive does not mean a person is obliged to read it. Katherine Paterson brings up a good point when she says, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...and you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. If everyone could remove a book that offended them, there would be no books left. There are many different views on many different subjects and everyone should have the opportunity to be educated on others' points of views. For example, there are many different religions in the world. Many of the religions have very conflicting points of views and some of their view points might offend each other. That does not mean that we should not provide information on different world religions simply because a person from another religion might be offended. Every person that goes to a library should have the right to educate themselves on others' religions. If we censored all the books that offended people, we would live in a very uneducated world. A library is a place of education and learning. It is a place one can go and learn about any subject he chooses. If libraries censored information, then it would no longer be a place that is unbiased. It would hold a sway to a certain group of people and therefore, no longer be a safe haven for all to go and escape the world. One could not go to a library and get different points of views on every subject. Therefore, to ensure the library remains a true source of knowledge and diverse perspectives, censorship on books and other materials in libraries would be a very negative thing.
1311	4288	2	3	Hi, my name is @CAPS1 and I am writing this article today to talk about things that shouldn't be in the library. There are many, many things that shouldn't be exposed to children such as, sexcism,racism,rarted @CAPS3, pornography. So i am here today to tell you all about them things. First off books that have racist comments in them should not be exposed to our young children. Why? Because that is setting a bad example for them so they might think they can say and do the things thats the book does. Another thing is sex in books. I know you have read stories that talks about sex and how to do it and all sorts of things. So to sum this up they shouldn't be allowed in public libraries. The second thing that shouldn't be allowed in public libraries is @CAPS2-@CAPS3 movies. Things such as horror movies, porn, and many more. So young children should not be exposed to these such things because it damages there mind at a young age. It teaches them things that they shouldn't know about until they get a little bit older. The last reason why I feel that many things shouldn't be in the libraries are for the @CAPS4 magazines. Those magazines just show everything they have all type of naked photos in them. These really do not need to be exposed to our young children because. Our little girls will think it is ok for them to take naked photos of themselves and post it in books and on the internet. So all in all, all of these things should be banded from the libraries for many different reasons. So the @LOCATION1 should think about what I am saying. Just think if it were your children being exposed to innappropiate things. These materials can negatively influence developing minds and promote harmful behaviors, so libraries should prioritize protecting children from them.
1312	4289	2	3	As a small child I remember my mom reading me stories to put me to sleep. There was always one book that I remember the most named, 'A light in the @CAPS1' by @PERSON1. As i was walking into my public library the other day i was looking at the books that had been cenored because it encouraged, the following; mistreating parents, offensive language, bad habits, and other things. I was mad that this book had, essentally, been erased from all of children literature just because a few people @CAPS2 that it gives a bad message. Think about it though, when you are a child either having a book read to you, or reading one yourself do you honestly pay attention to such small details?  I do not think that books and music should not be censored, because society does a good job of thinking and figuring out what is acceptable and what is not. I understand the idea of warning labels, but i feel that censorship is too far. In the example I used in the paragraph above, that actually happened to me. So, i do not think that things should be censored just because a small group of people think that it is inappropriate. Even when i read that book today i do not see any of the reasons that were listed in the book. Therefor beleive that it was unjustly censored, meaning that a really good book will never reach the eyes and ears of child that deserve to hear and read it.  Over the years many things have been censored, some had an actual reason, others maybe were looked at and censored because somebody did not like how they read the book. the point is, is that people should have a choice of what they can get from their public or school library. Maybe, they should just give an idea saying that there is potentailly inapprapriate materail in that certain book and should not be read to or by a certain age group. when you look back to your childhood and think of all the books that were read to you that you enjoyed, how many of those books have been cesored for reasons that make no sense? That is the primary reason why I believe there should not be any censorship, ultimately hindering access to potentially valuable and enjoyable stories for future generations, based on subjective and often unfounded concerns.
1313	4290	2	3	Almost every city in the @LOCATION1 has a public library. A place where the citizens can check out books, music, movies, magazines and more. Inside a library, there are different sections. There are kids sections, adult, fiction, and many more. Just like any ordinary store, there are items in a library that are not subject for children. A common question has been coming up everday life, 'Should we remove these offensive items from our shelves?' Libraries have been around for years and so have uncensored things that are being put in front of children. As a child, you want to explore and know everything. Bad things will always be put in front of you as an obstacle to make the right choice. Just like these degrading items found in everyday stores, libraries, or in general everywhere you go. A library, however, is not just intended for adults, teenagers, or young children. A library is made for everyone's access and not everyone is alike. Therefore there is plenty of variety in these libraries. It should never be a libraries fault for containing things not appropriete for children in my belief. Almost every library is very organized into categories. If children are separated and exclusive to adult material, I see no problem in having these items on the shelves. When I visit a library, these items are very out of reach for children. Society knows what should and should not be brought upon a child, so they know not to put it in any reach of children. Libraries often implement systems such as age restrictions or parental advisory labels to further guide patrons. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope non of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' said Author, Katherine Paterson. Katherine makes a very valid statement. If I have a child one day, I could think of plenty of materials I would hope my child never came acrossed. However, as a parent it is their job to protect their children from these things. Coming from a teenage perspective, at a young age, I was very clueless about all the terrible things sitting around me. A majority of children would not be able to get their hands on such uncensored items, nor would they understand them if they did. This lack of comprehension further minimizes any potential negative impact. There are things in this world that are much worse for children to see then taking a quick glance at something not for their age at a library. If anything, concerned parents should be paying more attention to what their children come in contact with at stores, the people they are around, or what they are listening/watching. The internet is probably the most uncensored place a child can come acrossed. Reaching out to libraries about what they put on their shelves should be of their least concern compared to what is really out there in life. The digital world presents constant and easily accessible challenges to parental oversight. I do believe that no children should be handed or put in front of uncensored adult conduct because one-hundred percent unacceptable. If these items were placed in spots where only adults can get ahold of, then I see no problem in the situation. The children of our generation and more to come will always encounter something they should not be put in fron of. However, that is life and there will always be something come up in your life that you should not witness or be apart of. If libraries continue to keep these items out of reach of children, then there should be no censorship in libraries, allowing them to serve their diverse communities without compromising access to information.
1314	4291	2	3	Censorship, @CAPS1 or @CAPS2? I can understand why libraries would decide to keep certain books off their shelves. Libraries are a place for learning and work, and the environment should reflect that. If you were sitting near someone at a public library who was reading smut you could feel awkward, and it could be distracting. Although some people @MONTH1 find certain items unoffensive, other @MONTH1 disagree. Imagine you are a mother with a young child who decided to wonder through the library. Your child finds a magazine. It's '@CAPS3'. Not something that you are going to want to explain to your child, and potentially scarring. If the library were to have not kept the magazine, it never would have happened. Libraries are a public place that should be taken seriously, especially when children are involved. If people really want to find something that is inappropriate they can find it somewhere else. The modern world today makes it easy for people to find just about anything without a large hassle. Therefore it should be fine to keep certain materials out of our libraries. How can people take libraries seriously if there are dirty books, or books with rude language, and scandalous themes? If you are trying to get work done or learn and there are distracting items on the shelves then it @MONTH1 make things more difficult, hindering the library's purpose. Libraries are serious places and should be treated as such, and curation is key to maintaining that environment.
1315	4292	2	3	There should be a certain age bookshelf that only certain aged people are aloud to look at. It's like the adult section at the library. Theres no reason why they should be removed off of the shelves. I would understand if the little kids could come see the books and movies and be offended by it or scared but thats why you would make a certain section just for older more mature people. It would just depend on what offends people and what would make them offended. Some things could or would be bad to have little kids see them, but just make sure they couldnt get in the reach of young kids or not matured people. The only way i would say remove them if it was really offensive such as racism and things like that. Censorship in libraries in my opinion is a good thing. Just because the fact of some people might not like the things that would be in a library or things that they have in the library, does not mean that the material should be removed for everyone. So I would have to say yes on cersorship in the library, but only when dealing with truly harmful content. Creating age-appropriate sections allows for a balance between access and protecting younger, more impressionable audiences, while still preserving the availability of diverse content for older individuals.
1316	4293	2	3	There are many books, movies, and magazines on shelves that can offend people in many ways. These can be books of war, slavery, and even religion that could aggravate people and make them feel the need to remove those books from the libraries without hesitation. There are indeed many books out there that could offend people and could be discriminating, but should those books really be taken out? I believe that books were made for a purpose. Each book and even magazine has a fact of information regarding what is either happening in the world or what could happen. Even for the books that are unrealistic they are also made for a reason and should be allowed to have their place in the library. The library has over thousands of books and movies to choose from. If there even was one book that someone found discriminating or offensive they could always just pass by it and choose one that suits what they want. I feel that it is the person's choice of what they want to read or watch not the books or movies fault. The books and movies are also split into genres into which each movie and book belongs in. So if you don't specifically want to see something than you can just skip the section the movies or books are in that you find discriminating and go to the ones that you feel okay with. There are also many books and movies out there that might seem discriminating but they could actually teach you about life and what could happen and how to solve these problems. One example is when I was child growing up I was reading about this girl getting into a car accident and losing everything just because she was drunk while she was driving. My mother didn't want me reading the book, but it actually helped me a lot because it taught me the valuable lesson of never drinking and driving, because of reading that book at such a young age and implanting the story in my head I know that I will never in my life do what that girl did to herself. This shows that even if a book might seem discriminating and wrong it can still teach people life lessons and danger that they probably wouldn't know about unless they read that book or watched that movie. I feel that even if we removed the offensive magazines, books, and movies that don't have any potential what so ever, people would still find a way to get what they were looking for, even if it is from the library or not. There are many people that are wrong in this world and banning certain books from the library probably wouldn't stop them from doing what they want to do. Music is another thing that shouldn't be that troubled about. Some people listen to certain types of music to calm their nerves down. One example is the rapper @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1. His songs consist of severe sadness and frequent cussing, but in his songs are messages that can relate to other people and listening to that certain song might stop them from doing illegal things or even committing suicide. The songs can symbolize their lives and make them know that they are not the only ones living that way and that they aren't always alone in what they do. I feel that each book, movie, and magazine has at least one thing that a person can find offensive. If we start removing each one that someone finds offensive than there probably wouldn't be a single book left on the library shelves. The books we read, the magazines we glance at, and the movies we watch will probably have something offensive in them but I do not think that they should be censored or removed because there is always a chance that those books, movies, or magazines could help you out later in life, so we must acknowledge the potential benefits that can arise from even the most challenging or controversial content.
1317	4294	2	3	Freedom of speech and the freedom of press is a privilege we as AMERICANS are lucky to have. I don't believe in censorship in libraries. Authors, publishers, editors, and directors all have a right to express their opinions in their work. If they would like to express some adult subjects in their work that is their choice. They have a right as people to portray their books, magazines, and movies anyway they want. We all have the choice to what books and movies we want to check out at libraries. Movies are required to have ratings so the audience knows the extent of the maturity you must have to watch the film. For example if you are a 10 year old who wants to checkout a movie but, it's rated R that is not the best choice of movie. It WOULD not be the best choice because movies rated R let the audience know its for a mature audience over the age of 17. As for books, I often use a book review website that allows me to see the content the book has. If I see that the book contains material I don't wish to read about or think the material is too mature, I don't read it. I hold the power to choose the books I read and the responsibility to choose the books best suited for my age and maturity level. There are many ways we can track the content of the things we can checkout. Just because a movie or book is released doesn't mean we have to watch or read it. We all make choices in our everyday lives. Some are big and some are small. Picking a book or film to checkout from a library is a small choice, but it is our choice to choose what we can handle. Author's, directors, and editors should not have their work punished if some people don't agree with the content they are putting in their material. Everyone's opinion varies on what's right and wrong. Therefore if you believe something is inappropriate you have the choice of not reading or watching it. I do believe we are lucky to have this freedom of opinion and speech. Although we shouldn't abuse it we must not forget we have no right to tell others how to use this freedom. As we have the choice to read what we want to, authors have a choice on what they want to write about. Libraries shouldn't take away this freedom that allows us to make our own decisions on what we view or read, as restricting access undermines the very principles of choice and individual responsibility that underpin a free society.
1318	4295	2	3	Do you ever feel like books, music, movies, magazines and etc., are offensive sometimes? To my experience of listening to music and watching movies it can be offensive sometimes without even knowing it. I have listened to rap before and all the cuss words they use, and watching movies with only white people or black people. So I think some music, movies and etc., could be taking off. If I think something is offensive I pretty much blow it off like its nothing. I do that because I have watched **movies** like **Remember the Titans** the white and black people didn't get along, and they had to play football together. Then they finally got along and won the champion game. To me I think that's awesome because people were offensive, and got over it and now they're friends. So don't take **media** offensive. I say that because how do you know that the actor or the writer was or is talking about you. I look at this like it's a little deal. I like **media** like that I find it entertaining. It can also help you learn, about what's happening to our world, and what we have accomplished. So I really don't take this **media** as offensive. But, other people can take it offensive and that's their problem. There is nothing that can be done it's over with. If something is offensive then don't listen to it or don't watch or read it. So don't think it's right to pull it off the shelf and abhor it. They can have a really good meaning behind it. There are many movies, songs and books in the world that are good. So don't abominate it and go on in life don't let **media** get to you. That's why I don't think it's right to pull it off the shelf and take it offensive. That's why I think it's not bad to take **media** offensively, and ultimately, it's best to focus on the positive aspects and broader messages that these forms of expression can offer.
1319	4296	2	3	Dear Newspaper, I would like to start off by saying yes, books, magazines, music, movies, etc., are great for the kids in the library. I think that's the best thing for them to do when they don't have anything to do, go to the library and read or work on stuff in the library, and I think that some things should be in the library because we are in high school and we need to learn some things here, but some of the things we learn are not very appropriate. In high school, just walking down the hallways, you're going to learn a lot of things you probably don't need to know yet, but when you walk into a library, they don't need to encourage it by putting books of drugs, alcohol, and sex on the shelves. Books about drugs are alright to an extent. If you're reading about medicines you can take and being in the doctor's office and getting prescriptions is alright, but when you got books about pot, weed, crank, or meth, that's a little much. We need to learn about those drugs and what they could do to us if we use them or abuse them, but we don't need to know how to roll a blunt or make meth. Books about alcohol are the same way. We need to know the dangers of drinking, but we don't need to know about teen parties and things to do when you're drunk. Advertisements, magazines, etc., are the worst things for us kids because every one of them has something to do with drugs, alcohol, or sex and trying to get us to do those things in high school. The front cover of magazines always have people who have got caught with drugs who is dating or sleeping around with who, and I know that we will and need to know these things, but I don't think we need to read them out of books because then we read it and see how other people did it, and we feel the need to do it or try it. I believe these books that are over the line about alcohol, drugs, and sex need to be taken out of the libraries so that the kids have something to learn about and ask their parents about. I have been in the libraries, and I know for a fact that the first books I go for have one of those three involved in it because those are interesting, and we like reading about stories at parties or someone getting pregnant or an STD, but also when I read, I think about it, and I think I want to go to a party; they made them sound fun. This is what I think about some of those books on the shelves and what I think should happen, as keeping these books can influence our choices negatively. Sincerely, @LOCATION1.
1320	4297	2	3	Libraries Do you go to libraries? Many people all over go to libraries for many different reasons. Sometimes when you go there, you have to have a reason to be there. You also have to be very quite. Libraries are very interesting in many ways. Some people ask what a library is; well, they are good places to go. People can go there for many different things. Most of the time, when people go to a library, they go to get books. Not only can you get books from there, but you can also go there for school tutoring, for a place to read, and just to go somewhere quiet. See, libraries have many things to do. Why do people go to libraries? Well, I personally do not go to a library, but many others do. People that like to read go there to get a kind of book they want. I would go there for tutoring for school; I honestly need it. It helps you a lot and gets your homework done. My mother goes there on some occasions, like to get information from a book or a computer. They have a lot of information that you can look for. Then there are online geeks who like to get online for video games. I get on the internet, but not for video games. There is another reason why people go to the library. My little sister loves going to the library. She is only eight years old. Why am I telling you this? Well, when you go into a library, you cannot get a book if you are underage. In that case, you have to have parents' permission to be able to get one, but not only that, you have to have a library card in order to get a book. I know, stupid rules, right? So then again, you have to have parents' permission for that too! Well, after the permission is all said and done, when you go to get a book, you have to make sure it's your own grade level. I have to watch that with my sister all the time because if not, then they will yell at you. I personally think that is good for most kids. So now you know that libraries are very strict. Now that I told you all about libraries, I hope you learned something from it. Remember that they are very good places to go to for information, to get books, or just to go somewhere quiet. You can always find a library around; there are NO EXCEPTIONS! Well, if you don't like to read or be quiet, then you shouldn't go. I'm going to leave that up to yourself to decide.
1321	4298	2	3	In @LOCATION1, people like to do many dfferent things for fun. Some like to go to movies. Others perfer a nice walk through the park. Now a days everyone is all stuck up and think that we should not see and or read bad, nasty, offensive things. I believe that we should be able to see what ever we want. The first reason we should be able to read what ever we want is because we have the right to. There are lots of things that we cant do but reading should not be one of those things. We shouldnt have to ask some one if a book is ok to read or not. Its not fair to those who want to read it. Its really a matter of personal choice and freedom, and restricting that feels very dumb. The second reason we should be able to read what ever we want is because if you dont like it, dont read it. This is a very simple an straight forward concept. Everybody today is worried about what everyone else is doing. If yo dont like something then dont pick it up and read it. If i knew there was a boook that i didnt like because it was offensive to me, i wouldnt read it. Its just that easy. The third and final reason why we should be able to read what ever we want is because its none of your bussines what other people do or read. Everbody today is so worried about the next guy that its not even funny. If we all just worried about our selfs, then we would be better off. If i read a book that i found offensive or bad, i wouldnt go around telling others its a bad book and that is should be pulled off the shelfs. Its not right and its not fair. We should be able to read what ever we want. Its our right to read it. Also, if you dont like it, then dont read it. People today are too worried about other people. If other people want to read a book that you find offensive or bad, there is nothing that you can do about it. That is the way life works, and imposing restrictions just creates unnecessary conflict and limits individual freedom.
1322	4299	2	3	If you take offense to certain things, you shouldn't read the pieces of literature that make you feel like that. Ask some of your friends or research the book/magazine before you read it. Sometimes the front can be deceiving so make sure you read the description first. Many people that read certain things in general take them the wrong way and think they say something they don't really mean. Which is why they take offense to it, but the more you understand a piece of literature the less you are offended. You should try to at least accept some of what the book/magazine says just in case you need it in the future. You get upset when you read something for the first time, and not notice that it could help you when you think about it. Thinking about things is a great way to learn how to deal with being offended, just look from both points of view. They both could have good ideas and functions to them. Try avoiding them if you are still offended by them, don't read a lot of books/magazines that have offensive things in them. Ignore the ads on the television or computers that have more than what you need to know in them or if they make you feel uncomfortable watching them. If you read them it could make you feel worse or make you mad. Sometimes they can even make you stress a little. If you are really offended by something the best thing you could do is avoid it. Avoiding something helps you to not read them or think about them. This works for a lot of situations not just this one, so if you need to get away from the stress just ignore them, allowing you to maintain a more peaceful state of mind.
1323	4300	2	3	Books can always be amazing things in how they take us to whole new worlds and how they enlighten us to new ideas we might have never thought about before. However, are some books just too much to handle and should not be read? Well think what you will, but I believe all reading and media materials should stay on their shelves in libraries because people should have a right to know what is in the real world, even some of the bad parts. Different assortments of media should definitely not leave libraries or be banned from them because people need to be educated in all that exists, they need to know even the bad things in this world so they can hopefully be educated enough about it they can go away from evil acts and help fight against them, and first and foremost it is their right to choose what they want to read because each individual must have the option to be who they want to be. Though we can only hope that by giving people such knowledge they can rise up and do what is right. Even education today is being influenced by people saying that students can not be taught certain realms of knowledge, but in the long run does this really help people? If people were educated enough to know about everything we know and what they themselves as an individual choose to learn, wouldn't that help them from becoming curious and learning lies from an invalid source, instead of the array of resources they would have open to them at a library? Each individual should have the right to learn what they want to learn and should not be closed off from any resources, otherwise they will never learn the real truth behind a topic, which would work against the whole point of learning. These seekers of knowledge should always be able to seek as they please, so that they learn and hopefully make new advancements for everyone's benefit, but they can only hope to this with proper education. Another point to look at is that people need this variety of education, so they can work for causes important to them. With knowledge people can make new innovations and create and spread new ideas to help make the world better. Although this can only happen when they know both sides of the story, so that if they oppose something they can know what they are talking about and what they are pushing against and what cause they are pushing for. The only way people can truly make their ideas heard will be when they can understand all about their topics. Without certain points of information that could be taken out, people have no backbone to what they are saying and then they would even hamper other people's learning processes as well. Also another reason to not have censorship is that we all have rights in America, and hopefully globally someday, to be who we want to be in the pursuit of happiness as long as we do not hinder anyone else's dreams in our own pursuit. People really just need to be who they really are in order to help the world and make differences, because if we were not allowed to be our own individuals then people would never advance. Without this advancement, people would have just remained the same in their cultures and beliefs, but instead people chose to seek knowledge, and in doing so gave us the technology people have today. Harry Potter even argues in his popular books series that we must know the enemy to fight them. Would he have become such a hit if others did not believe this as well? To change this would go against the rights people have found for themselves, thus meaning if we gave these rights away, people would have regressed. People should always be allowed to access all types of media, especially in libraries. These media types help shape who each individual is and helps them to help make contributions to the world in their lives. Though there will always be bad media, we must understand even the bad in this world, so that hopefully people will make the choice to combat it. We all certainly would not be the people we are today without all the influences on us and by taking away even parts of knowledge we would end up only debilitating ourselves. These choices all help us to hopefully advance and continue forward into the depths of understanding, so that knowledge will continue on forever.
1324	4301	2	3	I believe that if some people don't like a certain book or movie then they should be able to tell the library about that item and it should be removed from the library. The library should allow people who use the library to take away things that are offensive to their customers. Some parents who come into a library with their children let their children go off and look at books by themselves which is what my parents used to let me do when I was a kid. If children are by themselves with no adult supervision and wander into an adult reading section they could look at something bad. They could also buy a magazine that looks perfectly fine on the outside but have offensive images on the inside.  When I was ten years old, my family and I went on vacation to Florida. We were watching a baseball game that was on commercial break one night. We were flipping through the channels waiting for the game to come on. We were all watching the television when an offensive image came on the television that children's eyes shouldn't see. That occurrence happened when I nor my parents wanted me to see it. That image was an adult image and was meant for adults only, but children's eyes can see it as well. Libraries should think of this when they are putting books and magazines on their shelves. They might be making a little bit of money but they are effecting a child's life in a negative way. Things like this could happen in a library also because children who are young won't always know what is a child's book and what is an adult magazine. Children also might ask their parents for music that the case of the music might look fine on the outside, but have cursing and bad things on the inside. This is the reason why all items in a library that are offensive to people should be removed from libraries.  If people who go to the library don't like something on the shelves they should be able to ask the library to take the item off the shelve. The library might not do it everytime, but taking items off the shelves would make libraries more enjoyable and safe for children. If the library doesn't take the items off the shelve it could effect their business in a negative way. The library should only take off the items that regular visitors to the library ask for. The library shouldn't listen to someone who has visited the library only a few times. The library should listen to its customers that visit the library often, because they are the people who use the library the most.  I think that all offensive images to people that visit the library should be taken off the shelves and removed from the library. The library should listen to its customers not only because it could effect their business, but becasue it could effect the lives of children in a positive or negative way, and a safe and enjoyable environment for all patrons should be the library's top priority.
1325	4302	2	3	The offensive things found in a library. In many libraries now a days there are all kinds of vilent and bad books talking about vilenst. Should libraries take these books, movies, or music off the shelfes find out. The library should not have to take these tipes of things out of the library. If they have bad related books they should just make a different section in the library for them. For rated @CAPS1 movies they can have them in the library. You have to be over @NUM1 years of age. For music if it has an @CAPS2 sticker you have to be over @NUM2 to rent it. If the parents dont like it then dont get it. They should make different sections in the library for the offensive books that they have, perhaps labeling them for mature readers. Kids under a surtain age should not be allowed to read the books. If they still want the book they have to get parents permissition to rent it. Rated @CAPS1 movies they should be allowed in the library. You just have to be over @NUM1 to go in that area and with an adult. If you want to rent a movie you need to have parents permissition. You also have to watch this movie with an adult. Music if it has an @CAPS2 sticker you have to be over @NUM2 to rent it. You can still rent it if your parents say its ok. They should make the @CAPS5 behind the counter. So that little kids can not see the front of the cases. If the parents dont like the libraries rules then dont rent anything from the library. So dont take off the offensive books, movie, or @CAPS5. If you were head of the library what would you do? Take out the offensive things, or just put them in different sections; I would choose to create distinct sections and implement parental permission policies.
1326	4303	2	3	Reading is very popular. It is something to do when you are sitting at home and also when you are in the classroom. School libraries are filled with different varieties of books and magazines and such. Some of these books could be arguably offensive to some people. These books should not be taken away from the library shelves. There are some books that some people find so offensive that they can not even continue to read the rest of the book. Whether it be sexual or even political, if the reader finds it offensive they will not read the rest of the book. There are books out there that describe in detail sexual scenes and many parents do not want their kids to read these kinds of books. This is no reason to remove the books from the library shelves. It may be offensive to certain people but if you took it off of the shelves it would not be available for others to read who can handle that kind of story. Parents' kids should simply not read these books. Libraries can not take the books away all together from readers who enjoy these kinds of books. There are also books about politics. Majority of people stand firm with politics and do not budge when it comes to discussing what they believe is right or true. When a reader comes across a book that is against the way they see politics, there can be a real problem. With politics being a serious matter, many people can overreact when someone tells them what they believe and think is true is really not. Politicians themselves especially. Still, many authors write about political matters and some books can educate the reader about points that they have not yet seen before. If a reader does not agree with what the author is writing or they find it offensive, they should not read the book. There are plenty of other readers out there that would like to read that book and to learn more about politics. If a reader knows that this kind of reading offends them, then they should know better than to pick up the book in the first place. Many libraries offer music, movies and magazines to check out and to take home. It is true that many of these movies or the lyrics in the songs could strike someone as offensive. For this reason, they should not check them out. Many people enjoy music or movies that have offensive language. It is something that adds to the song or movie. People know their limits and if they know the contents then they should stay away. As long as there are other readers and people who like those kinds of books and music then they should keep them on the shelf. Taking them away would only take away from the number of people who visit the library. You could go to your local library and find people looking through the music section, and the music section is the only reason they come to the library in the first place. The music and movie section should stay in libraries. The people that are checking them out should be mature and responsible enough to know if they find the contents offensive. Libraries should not take certain books, movies, and magazines away that some people find offensive. Some books and music do have contents that are offensive to some readers and viewers. However, if it is offensive to the first person, it does not mean it will be offensive to the next. The libraries need to keep these sections in their libraries for all different kinds of readers. Reading is an extremely popular activity. Readers want a variety of books, music and movies to choose from, and libraries should provide these diverse options to cater to all interests.
1327	4304	2	3	In every school or library many people see books that are inappropriate for their taste. Everyone has their own opinion, and what might seem offensive to you, might be something that someone might want to know about. So should we take the books that only the majority of the people think are offensive off the shelves, or should we keep them anyways? Here is what I believe we should do. Books are meant for learning and for pleasure not to try to offend anyone. They each have their own purpose and there was a reason for why they were written. There are tons of books out there that many people dont like, but that doesn't mean someone else doesn't. We should keep the books in the schools and in libraries, because they might help someone in a way and if they weren't there, how would that person get help if nothing else was avalible? One thing we can do is categorize the books by the genre, so that way people know what they are looking for. Many people find these books that are 'offensive' because they come across them randomly. If each book was put into a certain category then that incedent wouldn't happen. It also helps keep everything organized that way. So when you go into the library you know what you are looking for, you can just go right to that section and not look at anything else that might be offensive to you. Keeping books on shelves is what all libraries and schools intend to do. That is the main reason for libraries. They help you learn and get information about things that maybe you can't get anywhere else. If every library took off the books each person complained about what the point in having the library? There would be nothing left. In all, everyone is entitled to their opinion and has a right to think that a book is offensive, but the reality is that it was written for a reason. If the library or the person who published it thought it was going to be a big deal, they probably wouldnt have put it out there for the world to see. So keep the books on the shelves, and allow readers to make their own choices about what they want to read.
1328	4305	2	3	Going to the library is always a struggle when someone is faced with so many different genres of books. That isnt the only choice they are faced with either. There is music and magazines too. Just within the books, there are so many different subjects and catagories between kids books, biographies, autobiographies, etc. On top of that there are alot of different types of music to fit everyones different styles. Some people might say that some of the books and/or music could be found offensive or not appropriate. But out of all the meterial in the library, I don't think there should be a problem with staying away from a the things that you might find offensive. Therefore I do not think that certain books or music should be kept away from the shelves due to a few self opinions. There are multiple different books in a library and just because one might find one book offensive doesnt mean that the book should be pulled off the shelves. The reason being is that someone else could find that book as a good resource and might need it for something they are doing. People should know what they are looking for at the library and if they think that a book might be offensive then they could keep their self from checking out that book. This problem is similar to others around the world. For example, when you go to the mall there are shops that you know you like and go to, and you stay away from the ones that you dont like or might find offensive due to the items they sell. That doesnt mean that store should be banned from the mall. Thats because some people might find that store interesting and want to purchase some of thier items. I think the same reasoning goes for different books and meterial at the library. A way that a library could adress this problem with out pulling theses books from the shelves is maybe taking a survey from thier local visitors in thier town by asking them what they think on some of the different genres of books and different styles of music. After taking this survey the library then could seperate these items into different catagories or sections within the library, perhaps with appropriate content warnings. This could help this problem tremendously due to the fact people could stay away from those sections that they might find offensive and find what they are looking for alot easier. I know when I sit down and read im not always caught reading the most popular subjects. I like to read subjects such as murder files, drug bust, biographies, and autobiographies. And then when it comes to music I listen to a wide variety of music such as hip-hop, country, alternative, rock, etc. Some people might find that wierd and unusual but it just goes to show that not everyone wants to read and listen to the same thing. Therefore the library should keep the wide selection of different meterial and keep everyone happy, catering to the diverse interests of its community and respecting individual choices.
1329	4306	2	3	I think that libraries should not remove any of the books they have now. If parents or people don't want to read those type of books they don't have to, but they shouldn't be removed. I agree that some books are inappropriate and have bad language in them but that's part of the book and how the story was made. When a book is made the way it is and is already published there shouldn't be any changes made to it. If a story contains a certain scene that a person believes shouldn't be in the book, that person needs to put that book back and choose another book they think is appropriate. Some people like to read stories with details so they can picture it in their mind. I know I do. In libraries they have books with inappropriate language and scenes described but to a certain age. I think you have to be thirteen or older to read them, and that's a good thing because by that age you know things better and your parents shouldn't be too worried. So in my opinion I don't think they should be removed from libraries. On the other hand movies that have scenarios that are disturbing should be removed. Movies are a whole different thing than books. They show the material that is being described and I don't think teens should be watching that. They can be very inappropriate and disturbing to some people like me. I wouldn't want to watch that in front of my mom or dad and especially a younger sibling. Then again it's just my opinion. If parents are okay with their child or children watching that then it shouldn't be a problem. Music isn't that bad. There are a lot of parents who don't want their child or children listening to a certain type of music because of their religion and what they believe in. I totally agree. My parents at the beginning wouldn't let me listen to music where all they would do is sing about sex and curse over and over. As I got older they didn't care much because I wouldn't listen to it as much. I'm a teen and I also believe that some of the music now in days in not very appropriate for anyone at any age. Some of what they sing doesn't even make much sense. In libraries I think they should only have music that relates in some how to the books. Magazines are not really a problem. Most of the magazines talk about beauty and fashion tips. They have horoscopes and give advise. A lot of the magazines keep people updated on celebrities and their life style. It has some what gossip. There mostly for older teens and grown ups. For younger teens and kids there's more appropriate magazines where they talk about younger celebrities. This is my point of view on things. I know that a lot of people don't entirely agree with me but this is what I think. I also know that there will be a lot of people who agree with me and they'll most likely give the same reasons as I did to support their choice, but ultimately, libraries should aim to provide a wide range of materials while allowing individuals and parents to make informed decisions about what they choose to read, watch, or listen to.
1330	4307	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials; books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelf if it is offensive to some people? Accordingly, I do not believe this way. If we were to take books off a shelf for everyone who thought it was offensive, we wouldn't have any books left on the shelf. According to my prior knowledge, I know certain materials will affect different people in different ways. I have had my own experience when in school. Some people do not want to say the pledge due to saying 'one nation, under God.' We all have various opinions on subjects; so we all will react differently. However, that doesn't mean we should take away something he or she finds offensive; others find it appropriate. Observing others when in offensive situations previously help find a solution to these problems. The solution is certainly not to remove what some find offensive for many people will disagree until eternity. Censorship in libraries should be based on separation. Materials that fit under one category should be put in one section. Often times, this separation helps people find what they need and not be offended. In our own constitution it states that all citizens are free; freedom of speech in particular. All materials are written by someone with an opinion so by taking their books off the shelf, we are taking their freedom of speech away. It is how they express themselves. If someone finds it offensive then they should quite simply not read it. Removing the material might frustrate and offend the author or other readers. It is plain and simple: We shouldn't remove certain materials due to someone finding it offensive. Censorship in libraries should be based on separation, not people getting offended easily. It's based on choices. People should get to choice what they want to read or watch without others taking it away from them. So now what do you believe; Should certain materials be removed? Ultimately, restricting access based on subjective offense is detrimental to intellectual freedom and personal choice, and separation by category is a more reasonable approach.
1331	4308	2	3	Have you ever sondered through the library just to specifically find that one good book, magazine, or even CD that didn't involve inappropriate material for once? You feel like a little kid in the shopping mall just impatiently waiting to find that one toy, but it never shows up. You spend seconds, minutes, even hours still slowly pacing back and forth shelf to shelf, and finally you find it and you open it and see the most inappropriate picture ever, or maybe listen to the most vulgar language, or even take a skim through the most offensive reading yet. Do you wish it'd change? I visit the library every time after I finish my book; I have loved reading from the time I was little. Lately, I feel like my reading interest has gone down though, not due to my act of being involved in other things, but possibly because lately I feel like every book I pick up comes off offensive. For example, I went to check out a new book; I was mind-boggled at this time because unlike usual, I had no clue on which book I was even interested in reading next. The librarian directed me to their new bestseller and addressed it and said it was as hard to put down as a lollipop. I checked it out, and after the first paragraph, I wanted to throw up. This book was too gory, and I felt like it downgraded women; I was anything but satisfied. This wasn't the first book me or my friends had checked out like this, and I have a feeling it won't be the last. I just hope I could check out a book not so offensive and actually worth my time, but it seems like lately, they are all changing and becoming too much for me, and it really upsets me. Our library seems to be over-packed with magazines, which isn't a bad thing because I love them. I label magazines as a light read and very good at passing free time. I never get tired of all the pictures, all the gossip, and all the jokes at the end. Lately, my opinion has changed though; these magazines are starting to alter, and I don't like it. It seems as if I can't open my page without seeing a half-dressed girl, some inappropriate advertisement, or even tons of personal display of affection. Seeing these vulgar images are enough to make me not only flip the page but also never second guess about opening a magazine again. Music is like a drug to me, and I am addicted. There is never a day that goes by that I do not listen to music, but lately, music just isn't the same. I go to the library to check out some new CDs, and it seems everything I bother listening to uses every curse word out there. I was furious after my purchase, but also disappointed that people actually sell this garbage. I am somebody who listens to music to relax, not develop a new inappropriate vocabulary. It makes me wonder about the selection process and the standards being applied. I know there are plenty of good books, magazines, and music out there. We just need to find it again. I hope that we can banish these offensive, vulgar, and unnecessary items at the library. I know I'd greatly appreciate it, and from what I heard, many others would too. We want reading utensils worth reading, we want magazines our eyes won't mind to take a glance at, and we want music that won't pollute our brains, so that libraries can once again be a trusted source of enriching and appropriate content for everyone.
1332	4309	2	3	I don't think certain materials should be removed from library shelves. People have the option to get what they choose from the shelves; the librarians don't force them to choose the item. It is a free country, and I think people should choose what they want to read or watch. If people don't like it, then read the back of the movie or book before selecting it from the shelf. Ultimately, individuals should have the freedom to decide what they consume, and libraries should offer a wide range of materials to cater to diverse tastes.
1333	4310	2	3	I believe that there should be no censorship in the country of the free. In the country of the United States there should be no such thing as censorship. This country has the freedom of speech where we can say anything we want. This one band got banned in the United States for their music. How can your music get banned in the land of the free? I think that there should be no way that anything can be banned in a library; there should be no such thing. And how can we know good from bad if we never have seen bad? I know that there are some movies and magazines that parents don't want their children seeing. So, don't censor it; still have it, just make it where you've got to be a certain age to see that movie from a library. There should be no censorship in the land of free speech. How would we be called the land of the free if we are censoring everything? That is why I don't think we should censor anything in the United States, because limiting access to information contradicts the very principles upon which this nation was founded.
1334	4311	2	3	I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelfs if someone thinks they are offensive. Just because one person finds them offensive doesnt mean that they should be taken away from others who may like them. People are different, therefore we like different types of things. Different music, books, movies, and magazines. If you find it offensive, dont listen look or read it. Listen to the music you like, watch the movies you like, and read the books and magazines you enjoy. But just because you dont like something dont try and take it away from those that do. People are very different in many ways. But let someone express who they are through their likes and dislikes. Censorship has always been an issue but i believe that if people would just stick to what they know and like and leave everything and everyone else alone all would be ok. I understand that some people might find some things that are on the shelfs today offensive. But if you dont like it dont look at it or listen to it. Let it go and stick to what you know and like. After all the world is a very diverse place and we were not all made the same. Ultimately, the freedom to choose what we consume is important, and respecting that choice is key to a harmonious and diverse society.
1335	4312	2	3	Do you believe that if you just take a book off a shelf you or your kids won't be exposed to offensive material? If you do, then you are wrong. You can't isolate your family or other families from the world because you are scared that they might pick up something bad. Everyday, whether they read a book or not they are still exposed to vulger behavior. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any us.' Katherine Paterson's quote also helps understand the concept. If someone were to take a book off of a shelf at their home, a public library, or maybe even a store that they found offensive at any point in the book, then there would be no books left for children and even adults to read. In every book there is some form of material that people may not be a fan of. There would soon be nothing left.  There isn't a day that goes by that a kid doesn't hear something offensive. Even at school, where it's supervised, children bring words that they have heard their parents say or things that they have seen their parents do, and they share them with other kids. You can't protect them from every small encounter they are faced with.  Some books are by far more offensive than others, but are you going to give a kid a book that has vulgar language or, will you give a child a book that's about a bear running out of honey in his jar? Most children don't go to a library or a store without supervision if their parent is careful about just books. Therefore, their parents probably aren't going to allow them to pick up a obscene book or magazine, and in fact they would probably try to hide it from them.  If a book is put on a shelf then it is there for those who enjoy that material. If you can't make the world kid safe, then why would you try to make a library the same exact way. There are other people out there that might find the very material that you that is offensive fascinating, and a library is there to suit everyone's needs; it isn't there for just children, and attempting to sanitize it completely would ultimately be a disservice to the broader community it serves.
1336	4313	2	3	I think that we should definitely debate removing certain things like movies, music, and books because people are doing things these days that they never have before. For example, music is a great cause of people being motivated to do things and getting really into the songs. They try to do the same things as what their favorite artist or actor does. I hear some songs and they talk about illegal things, and I look around the world and hear children talking about those things and they ask their parents what it is. But they just don't want to tell them the truth, but once these kids get older, they will know what it is, and it will be their choice if they want to follow that path or think about something else. But about the people who are singing this, they're putting it in a way that is not bad, like you could do this all the time and enjoy it without getting in trouble, and in reality, these kids are blind and don't know what they're getting themselves into. Also, many books have offensive language that kids read all the time, but people don't even notice. That's how kids could get in trouble in school because they learn a new word in some book they never read or can't even read because they're too young to understand, but they do it anyways because of curiosity, and they don't know what they're doing. That's a way how a child becomes a bad person when he or she becomes older because they learned things that they shouldn't have learned. I think that we as a good country should make sections into what people can read and can't read, and it should depend on how old the person is. Some school libraries have movies that kids could watch, and it could be if you're an elementary school, middle school, etc. But some of these movies have offensive language and some inappropriate scenes, that kids would want to learn how to do those type of things. Or how they see the actors in the movie and they curse and they think it's cool because they're doing it as well. I think that elementary students should watch only PG movies, middle school PG-13 and down, and for the high school, we should be able to see basically any movie, but at the same time, I think most of the high school students have to be more mature; that's probably why we still don't have the privilege to see any movie because people don't know how to handle themselves. Finally, I really think they should minimize some movies, music, and books because kids are learning things they shouldn't be learning until they get older, and that those three things change the world in so many different ways, some are good, but most of them are bad, these are my opinions, and it is vital for us to carefully consider the impact of these forms of media on the younger generation.
1337	4314	2	3	There are a lot of issues concerning offensive material that are used for entertainment purposes. Sometimes these things should not be on the shelves. Such as movies, books, magazines, etc., they can be seriously offensive to other people that are different races or different religions. Censorship can be used to solve this problem, like in the book *Fahrenheit 451*, it was used to keep books out of the picture completely, to keep the society from becoming offended, or for that matter, thinking. However in this matter it is the complete opposite, having all kinds of negative material and not caring what it can do to other people, or potentially damage other people. However this can also be argued. The people that are offended by the material, whether religious or race, really don't have to be around the material in the first place. For example if the material is in a library, then the people don't need to go to the library. In conclusion, people don't have to be near the offensive stuff if they are offended, but people should not be so cruel; finding a balance between freedom of expression and sensitivity towards others is crucial for a respectful society.
1338	4315	2	3	Personally in my opinion I have no problem with anything found in libraries today. Yes, there will always be something you disagree with, but it's not hurting you so just ignore it. Kids don't walk around in the adult section of the library they go to the kid section so there is no need to worry about them. Kids are maturing at a much younger age these days. I believe there is no harm in libraries, it is a place where you go to get all the information you can. So why would you remove valuable information. The library is a place for all people no matter who you are, how old or ugly. Everyone can use the library for any reason, many times involving school. Personally I do not much use public libraries, but I often come to the school library to get stuff done or find a specific book. For example you might find a certain historical figure to be a horrible person that you don't want your kid knowing about. For me I am someone who wants to learn more about my own culture no matter of how bad it is. So why take that information away from me. Taking away a learning experience just because a group of people don't like the book does not mean everyone doesn't like it. I want to learn knowledge about myself and where I come from, even the difficult parts. Everyone is going to have their own views and beliefs. Overall I think the library is not a place to take things away when any one is welcome. It is a place to get away from it all, I think they should leave them just how they are, allowing access to diverse perspectives and knowledge.
1339	4316	2	3	I do not think people should take books off the shelves because the town libraries have those types of books available for those who wish to read them. People should enjoy reading all types of books. Some people only read different books. Little kids like fantasy and picture books, teenagers like romance, and others like nonfiction. It should not matter what other people think. If people brought books off the shelves then what will the other people read. Before you bring books off the shelves, you should ask and write down what other people like instead of doing what you think is right. Think about what would happen if u brought down books off the shelves. What would happen? I will tell you, you would lose customers. If you don't want children to read inappropriate books, then you should make a card saying that your parents give them permission to read those books. If that won't work, then make an age limit. Have the parents show you their birth certificate. Have a restricted section in the library. In order to get a book from the restricted section, then have a parent sign a note saying that their allowed. Children the age of thirteen and under should not be given magazines. If their the age of fourteen and up, then they can get a magazine. Music should not matter to parents, so there should be no problem there. If the movies are bought by the parents, then there should be no problem there either. The other things you can figure it out on your own. This is what I think should happen to books in a library. I told you how a library should work. I told you what I thought should go on in the library. I will give you some advise. Think before you do. That is all I am going to tell you, and I hope these suggestions will help keep libraries a place for everyone to enjoy reading whatever they choose.
1340	4317	2	3	I believe that all materials should be allowed in libraries, because we all have the right to choose what we want to read, listen to, and watch. Even if people banned some books from the library, other people would find a way to get them. We as the people of America have the right to live freely, which also includes the right to read freely. As for music and movies I think we have let ourselves go a little too far. We have made pornography an easily obtainable thing, and music that promotes sex, drugs, violence, and alcohol. The only thing keeping us from pure evil is the Motion Picture Association of America and their ratings on movies, music, and television. With magazines it's a little more complicated than the others; magazines have their own set of standards. We all know about *Playboy*, Oprah, and *Time*, but think about all of the magazines that we don't see. The ones that stay behind closed doors and rarely ever come out. Thus, while regulation is needed in some media, free access to information remains an important right that must be protected.
1341	4318	2	3	Books, magazines, movies, and music are created with a huge diversity. Fiction, @ORGANIZATION1 non-fiction, horror, fashion, sciencefiction, and many more categories of literature are made. There is something out there everyone will enjoy. What would you do if you did not have the choice to read, listen to, or watch the materials you like because someone else had an ill opinion of it? Everyone has an opinion. It @MONTH1 could be in favor of something or it @MONTH1 might not be. I believe every book, movie, magazine, and other piece of literature should have a rightful place on the shelf. To some people it @MONTH1 may be offensive, but that does not mean they have to read it. Someone @MONTH1 might enjoy a piece of work another finds offensive. It is all a matter of opinion. The opinion of one person should not effect materials being able to be on a shelf or not. If you walked into a libraray and the shelves were filled with books, but only books everyone had a good opinion about the shelves wouldn't seem very full. It is hard to get two people to agree on the same thing. Imagine trying to get everyone to agree on the literature in a public libraray. Censorship is understandble to an extent, but I believe the libraries should organize all their literature into categories and sections. In these categoires and section people @MONTH1 could look for the materials they wish to see and avoid the offensive materials they do not. Libraries have rated @CAPS1 R movies. Many people could consider rated @CAPS1 R movies to be offensive, but many people could enjoy watching rated @CAPS1 R movies. Who wins, the people who find then offensive or the people who enjoy them? It is a hard choice to make. I believe the libraries should carry the movies and if someone finds them offensive they should simply not watch them. The same goes for books, magazines, and music. If you find it offensive simply do not read it or listen to it. There are hundreds of different sytles of writing, plots of movies, lyrics of songs, and covers of magazines. They have such a diversity because everyone has a different opinion of the lyrics, covers, styles, and plots. They can not censor things just because some people find them offensive, as others @MONTH1 will enjoy them. What would you do if your favorite book was not allowed in your public lirbaray? It would be a great loss to not have access to something you enjoy, and that is why censorship based on personal opinions is detrimental to a diverse and inclusive library collection.
1342	4319	2	3	I do not think that books, movies, music, magazines, etc., should be removed just because some people do not like them. Maybe some others do like them and like to read them. There should be no reason that one person or persons should try taking something off of a shelf at a library just because they find it offensive. Many people like many different things and somethings that you read might affect others, but you don't care about that; you just care about what you want and like and what is offensive to you. What if something you were watching or reading or listening to was offending someone else, would you care? Would it bother you if someone told you it was offending them? Everyone likes different things, and some others might not always agree with what they are going to be interested in. Therefore, restricting access based solely on someone's personal offense seems inherently unfair and undermines the principle of diverse perspectives.
1343	4320	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? What I am going to discuss is whether I believe certain materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. I will also talk about my introduction, body, and conclusion. Do I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and anything else on any bookshelves or any other shelves that is offensive to anyone should be removed? I think this because nobody should be offended by anything. Everyone should not live offended by anything or anyone. I just explained and talked about if offensive things on shelves should be removed, and I answered yes. I also talked about the introduction, a body, and the conclusion. Ultimately, the goal should be a world free of offense, achieved by removing potentially offensive material.
1344	4321	2	3	It is known that anybody is able to rent books, movies, music, and magazines in libraries. It is also known that some of the material in libraries may be offensive or inappropriate. While some people believe that such items should be removed from the shelves, I believe that books, magazines, movies, and music should not be removed from the shelves. People should be able to read, listen, or watch whatever they want to; if someone doesn't want something that they find offensive in their house then he or she doesn't have to get it, and it doesn't mean that something that seems offensive still isn't enjoyable. The most important reason why I believe that items that appear to be offensive should not be removed from library shelves is because people should be able to read, listen to, or watch whatever they want to. Anybody is entitled to his or her own preference. Some people prefer R rated movies or music with explicit content. If that's what people are interested in then so be it. Anybody should not have to stop renting something that they want just because someone else doesn't want them to. Furthermore, if someone doesn't want something that they find offensive in his or her house then just don't get it. No one is forcing anyone to listen to or watch something that they don't want. It is actually a very simple matter. It's a choice whether someone wants to watch or listen to what they want, and they don't really have the right to be able to tell someone else that they can't watch or listen to what they want. If someone doesn't prefer something then they don't have to get it. Finally, just because something seems offensive doesn't mean that it still isn't enjoyable. The perfect example that I can think of is a movie that is R rated. Just because a movie is rated R doesn't mean that it still doesn't have a good story or moral to it. There are plenty of rated R movies that have won Academy Awards and plenty of other rewards. Another example is the singer Eminem. While his music may be offensive, there are still many people that enjoy it. Certain things that offend people can be enjoyed by other people. In conclusion, no one has the right to be able to stop anyone from renting what they want from a library. People just really need to mind their own business and not worry about what other people find enjoyable. Certain books, movies, music, and magazines are only offensive if certain people believe that they are. People can only choose what they want, and nothing more, so attempts to restrict access based on personal offense are inherently misguided.
1345	4322	2	3	I do not believe that books or any different materials should be removed from the libraries shelf. No, because them books or materials is not for everybody to look at. Like if you have kid's you should keep them in a kid's area. We cannot just start takeing down every book off the shelf because one person thinks it was not a good book. The reason why kid's should stay and the kid's area is so they want pick up that book thats not for them. We want the read to be reading childrens book.If a kid's pick up a bad book you should explaine to them that this book is not for them. Some books are inappropriate for kid's to read. so thats why they have there on area to be in. Kid's should not leave there area for a inappropriate book. I think that kids should list to appropiate music and a libriary. The inappropriate book or materials are not for the kid's to read so they should not be and that area to pick up a bad book. i feel like there are no bad book out there if you dont like the book maybe someones elese will. but like movies, music, and magazines should not be off the shelf because if it was inappropriate it would not be and the libriary and the first place. Everybody is not going to like everything but thats just life, and libraries should reflect that diversity of opinion and experience.
1346	4323	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a complex issue with deeply personal views. Individuals should be aware of their own boundaries regarding appropriate content. Libraries shouldn't be forced to remove materials they've already acquired. Censoring these items feels wrong. A solution could be to create a separate section for potentially offensive material, accessible to those who choose to explore it. Libraries are havens for escapism, offering diverse resources beyond books, like music and magazines. Removing materials would deter patrons. The internet and television are often more offensive than library content, so singling out libraries seems unfair. If libraries are to be censored, then all entertainment industries should follow suit. Ultimately, each library should have the autonomy to decide what's best for its community. Moving potentially objectionable materials to a separate area allows access for interested patrons while respecting the sensitivities of others, thus allowing the library to remain a resource for all.
1347	4324	2	3	I think that any book or movie should have some warning signs upon it, to ensure that all people know what they are going to experience before reading or seeing anything. Some movies or books read or watched, should have an age limit too. Some of the things people find offensive, other people do not, and if taken all of the stuff out of movies or books it could cause people not to go see or read as much movies or books. In a lot of music some things might be offensive, but if you don't appreciate what they say in the song then don't listen to that group. There are some rap artists that say some things people might not like but, you don't have to listen to them; there are a lot more bands and different kinds of music to choose from. It would be hard taking stuff out of movies and music like that because it might take a lot of what the people want to see. In magazines a lot of people including I like hearing the truth about celebrities and interesting facts about people and movies, that a lot of people do not know. If parents don't like their children reading those kinds of books have them go buy a set that they will enjoy having their kids read. Ultimately, providing warnings and age limits can help people make informed choices while avoiding excessive censorship that diminishes artistic expression.
1348	4325	2	3	My name is @CAPS1 and my views on censorship in libraries are that if any material that are found offensive should be take off the shelves. I have never came across a material that was offensive to me, but maybe someone else has and it really offended them. I'm not the type of person who would start an argument but i am a type of person who will speak whats on my mind and tell you what i believe in. People are concerned about if libraries take off certain kinds of books that their will not be books left on the shelves for anyone else. I have to say there are other places you can buy books at beside the libraries such as stores as in @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, and etc. Like i said i have never came across a book that i think should be pulled off the shelf, but of course i don't read a whole lot either but the books i have read i have never came a crossed any that were terrible. Books that have like how people can kill themselves, or how people get pregnant, and so on, them can be pulled off the shelves, but if you have a child in the library they shouldnt even be in the adult book section anyways, they should be in the kids book section. I have never heard of a kid book that is terrible and that should be pulled off the shelf. Most authors are smarter then that, or at least i would hope so. Music is a whole story its self. In my opinon if you don't want your kids to listen to adult music then don't let them. I know a lot of music that is bad and that i would never let my children listen to it but i know well enough if i don't want them to listen to it them i'm not going to play it while their around. I grew up around rap music so thats all i listen to, but when i have kids i know what they will be able to listen to and what they wont be able to listen to. Movies is the one that i have a problem with the most because in libraries, and other places such as, @ORGANIZATION1, and book stores they just put out movies for EVERYONE to see and it doesn't matter what's on the cover or what it's called. Now movies with bad covers and bad titles could be pulled off the shelves such as all the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' movies. The name of the movies aren't bad but the movie its self is not for a child to see so why even have it out on shelves for kids to see and want to watch it? Magazines and etc i don't have a big problem with because libraries don't have bad ones, but book stores do such as 'playboy and play girl' but they are usually put back in the very back behind all other magazines so children can't see them only adults can. The only way a child would see them is only if you point them out. I think i've said all i can say about my opinions and my experiences about books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries that should or shouldn't be pulled off the shelves. I havn't had a lot of experience but maybe that's because i don't have kids yet, i guess i will find out when i do have kids. I happy to explain my experiences and opinions to people who really care and want to know, and hopefully these viewpoints are helpful as we navigate these important issues together.
1349	4326	2	3	Library Censorship Libraries shouldn't have 'offensive' books removed from shelves. Parent supervision, librarian supervision, and your own common sense are three of the reasons why books shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are considered to be offensive. Parent supervision is one of the top priorities for knowing what your children read. If they don't want their children to grow up being 'stupid' then they should teach them to focus on educational books more. When they see their child in a row of books that they think is inappropriate, then they should remove their child from that area and take them to another area. Parents can guide their children toward age-appropriate and enriching literature. The librarian's supervision is also an important priority. Maybe they don't know the children's actual age, but if the librarian sees them in a place that they think is inappropriate for someone around their age, show them another book shelf. Just like parents, librarians will try to find an educational book that the child @MONTH1 enjoy. But, librarians obviously like to read since they are around books all day, so the child @MONTH1 be lucky and the librarian finds an adventure book for the child, or something else that the child finds interesting. Librarians can offer suggestions based on their knowledge of literature. The person's common sense is also a reason why 'offensive' books shouldn't be removed from libraries. Most people know how old they are and what kind of books they should read. If they are in an area of the library that other people @MONTH1 think is inappropriate for them to read, go to a different area. Individuals should be responsible for their own choices in reading material. Once again, I don't think there should be a censorship in libraries. If parents want their children to read books that won't 'rot your brain' then they should observe what books their child reads, trust the librarian to show them the correct books to read, and expect their child to have good common sense; therefore, censorship in libraries is unnecessary and undermines individual autonomy.
1350	4327	2	3	I think that books are fine if you take *that part* out. Your should be 13 or older to take them out of the libraries or stores if they are really that bad. If they are that bad they should have something on them like movies that are rated R. I have read some books that are really good, but kids shouldn't read them. I read this book called 'A Child Called It' and *the content* is really sad. *It's* about this child and he tells us what his mom makes him do when he was little. I liked the book but *the story* was sad, but I read *it* because people were talking about *it*. Some parents won't let their children watch certain things on the t.v. because they think that they are bad. I was watching this t.v. show at my grandma's house and she said that I shouldn't watch *the show* but I do. I'm 13 years old so I think I should be able to pick what I watch. I don't think she likes *the characters* because they yell a lot on the show and she says that is why I yell. Some movies are better if they have bad things in them, *bad language* makes them funny sometimes and that is what everyone likes. I would rather watch a funny movie then a kid movie. I watched them before though, so I think it's up to older kids and teens to decide what they want to read and watch.
1351	4328	2	3	No, the books and etc. should not be moved, because anybody can be interested in them. Someone could come in the library looking for any of them items and can't find it because the library removed them. First, there will be no reason for removing the books from the library unless more new books and etc. are coming in to replace them. Everyone is into different materials, books and stuff. That's why I say do not remove the items. People might come in the library looking for a book that they want. If that person can't find it they might complain, or take there bussiness else where. Then the library could start losing bussiness. Second, if they library start losing bussines it might be forced to close down. Then if the library close down the people who come there often won't have no place to study or work or nothing. What if those people don't have transportation they will not be able to get to another library. The owner of the library can lose money if it close down, because everyone don't have computer's and books at home. They can come do there research and rent books. Third, some people go to the library for peace and quiet, and the library is their only place to escape distractions. Little children go to the library looking for books and etc. to and if they can't find the book they want they might start crying. If they start crying people who are working can be disturbed. Then that person or people who are disturbed might leave and never come back and thats money lost. Students school's might not have the book they are looking for, and they come to the library and the library don't have it that student won't have a book. In conclusion, these are some reason and examples why I don't believe the books and etc. should be taken out of the library, as maintaining a diverse collection ensures the library remains a valuable resource for the entire community. Someone can be really interested in them items and they come to the library search for them and can't find them.
1352	4329	2	3	You are the mother or father of a young child, and you take them to the library. While there, you see some advertising for a new book. The sign is all bright and flashy, so you stop to read it. It turns out to be advertising a book and some movies that you believe should not even be available here, for they are far too inappropriate and offensive. What would you do? Personally, I believe that if you see something like that, that you believe is offensive, you should say something. Talk to the librarian and state your case about what is going on. Having offensive articles in a public library where kids of all ages go to do their homework, is just plain wrong. What if that certain library had no restrictions on who checked out what? So many kids could check things like that out, and not even know what it actually is! Could you imagine your child coming home from the library, and handing you a book, magazine, or movie that was way beyond anything they should ever see at that age? It would be disastrous! I may not have children, but I do have younger cousins. I know for a fact that if they brought home something inappropriate or offensive, their parents would be having a major talk with the librarian and quite possibly the library board. Libraries should have major restrictions on what gets checked out by who. For example, my library has three different kinds of library cards. One card is just to check out regular books. Another is so you can check out movies, music, and books. Then the third and final card is so you can check out books, music, and movies from the adult section in a small room at the back of the library. However, to even be eligible for the third card, you have to be eighteen or older and show proof of age. I strongly believe that if a library does carry materials some may find offensive, they need to be kept in a small room at the back of the library, or behind the librarians desk. This way, no one who does not want to see the materials doesn't have to. If someone did want to see or check out these materials, they should need proof that they are eighteen or older. This would make it easier for the librarian to keep track of who looks at or checks out the materials. Another thing, what if someone finds something offensive that someone else doesn't? Well, I honestly think that at least two or three people should comment on it being inappropriate or offensive, before it is actually taken off the shelf. If more than one person does say something, the librarian should place the book, magazine, movie, music, ect., in with the other offensive materials, where there is an age restriction. This is how it is at my neighborhood library, and I strongly believe that this library is a model for all libraries wanting to have more restrictions. If all libraries had more restrictions, it would be better off for everyone. Parents would not have to worry about their young children wandering around and finding something that is totally wrong for them. Older teenagers and young adults would be able to get their homework or projects accomplished without having all the distractions of the offensive materials. In conclusion, I hope you take all that I have said to heart. I hope you write an article talking about the restrictions in libraries, and how they would make everything better off; implementing these restrictions would create a more positive and secure environment for the community. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
1353	4330	2	3	I believe that some materials in the libary should be taken off. Some people @MONTH1 find them offensive because they might have bad things in them. Some types of music have bad language in them and people dont want little kids finding them. If a little kid saw that stuff then they would learn bad things. And they would say it in front of everybody and then everybody would being saying it. Alot of books are ok to read because they dont have bad things in them. some people like reading books that have drama and some people dont. Most books re ok to read. But some can have langauge in them and ahouldnt be aloud in the libary. But they can still be in there because some people might want to read them. If people dont want to read them then they shouldnt get them. Some movies have bad stuff in there. That kind of stuff should not be in there because alot of people dont want to watch movies like that. And if a kid would walk in there and get one and if it had that stuff and the parent fount out then the libary could get sewed for having that stuff. So they should be taken out of the libary so people wont get them. The libary can keep children movies in there to watch because they are not bad. It is important to protect children from potentially harmful content. If i worked at a libary then i would take magazines out. Sports magazines would be ok to keep in there. But alot of the others ones should not be there because they have alot of bad things in there and i wouldnt let people take them so i wouldnt have them in there. But sports and stuff would be ok because sports are not bad for people to read. People like reading about sports because it is interesting to read. That is just what i thank. Other people might see it the other way and they can. People are different and they will thank different things. Some people might want to read that and some people dont. So it just shows you that people are different because they thank things different then other people do. And some libaries have that stuff and some dont. sp if you are one of those people that like that stuff then go to one of them that have that stuff. And if you are one of those people that dont then go to one that dont have that stuff so you can get what you want and they can get what they want. Ultimately, the library should consider the community's diverse perspectives when making decisions about which materials to include or exclude, balancing freedom of access with concerns about potentially harmful content.
1354	4331	2	3	
1355	4332	2	3	The library is a public place. Everyone is allowed access to the library. It supplies everyday people with information that they are seeking to learn about. There are so many different forms of information and entertainment offered inside libraries. Books, music, movies, etc, they all can be found there. Since they all can be found, censorship in libraries should not be allowed. Genres were created for a reason. Certain items have different forms to them. There are many forms of music. Classical, rock, and blues are some examples. Since music is categorized in such a way, there should be no need for them not to be on the shelves at a library. If a certain type of music or book is known to be offensive, then that certain genre can be avoided. There is no need to even visit a section of the library if one knows that he or she finds it offensive. In the United States the American people are given many rights that are often taken for granted. The freedom of speech is one. It is a privilege that if taken away would tear America apart. The freedom to say what you please also includes singing. Certain music that is on the shelves at a library does have the right to be there. Just because a certain group of individuals finds the type of music offensive, does not mean everyone also thinks that way. For this reason any genre of music can sit on the shelves at a library. Another freedom given to the American people is the freedom of press. Anything put onto paper is legal. Criticizing the government or fantasizing about school, it is all legal. Books can be offensive to many people. They can persuade one in ways that is unbelievable. Like music, books have many categories. Whatever is put inside those books is allowed to be there no matter what. Movies are located at libraries as well. They are categorized just as much as books and music. The term 'don't judge a book by it's cover' is true sometimes. This can also be used with movies. The title of a movie or book will tell what it is about. Certain movies that are not meant to be seen by children are rated R or PG13. These ratings help censor things to a certain extent. It is not illegal for a library to have a rated R movie. It is illegal however to check one out to a child of a young age. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries. All types of genres of all types of entertainment can be found in libraries. From books to videogames there are ratings and genres. If someone is offended by these types of entertainment they should not visit that section of the library. It is not illegal to have certain types of music, books, movies, etc inside a library. As long as no laws are being broken, there should be no problem, upholding the principles of free access and individual choice within the library system.
1356	4333	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I do not think it should matter whether we have music, movies, or magazines in the library. Some people like to come into the library to relax and look at a magazine or listen to some music. I do not think it bothers anybody by what other people are doing there, and if it is not bothering them, it should not bother anybody else. I see people sometimes reading a book and listening to music; it does not bother me when they do this. It is a way for them to drown out the world and enjoy a good book. The only reason why we should consider limiting certain materials in libraries is if their use creates a disturbance. Specifically, if some people get very loud when they're looking at magazines, or when their music is turned up way too loud, it could disrupt others. Other than that potential for disruptive behavior, I do not think we should keep those types of materials out of libraries. I am a reader myself, and I like to read in peace. So, I like to listen to my music while I am reading. I also like to read magazines every once in a while; it is really relaxing to me. These are my reasons why it should not matter whether we have those types of materials in the library, provided they are used respectfully and do not disrupt the library environment for others seeking a quiet space.
1357	4334	2	3	I don't think that books, movies, music, or magazines should be removed from the library because doing so would likely cause a loss of customers. Most people enjoy reading; I read to study, and removing study materials would be detrimental. Teachers also utilize the library for research and obtaining books for their families.  Music provides benefits to many, aiding concentration during homework, work, or stress. Offense taken towards such resources seems unwarranted, especially considering the lack of prior complaints.  While I haven't personally borrowed movies or magazines from the library, I acknowledge that others, especially parents and grandparents, do so for children. The library typically offers age-appropriate content. Depriving children of these resources seems unfair, considering their harmless nature. Ultimately, removing these resources would negatively impact library patrons of all ages and backgrounds, and there is no good reason to do so.
1358	4335	2	3	Did you know that libraries contain books, movies, music, magazines, etc.? Yes! They have it all, if you ever need something for research or a project just go there. But if there is something that you do not like, just keep going. I do not think that the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I think that if it is something that offends you then you should just keep going; explore other options. That 'something' that might offend you, could be helpful to others in their learning or exploration. So, now you know if you ever see something that you don't like in the library just walk away and find something that better suits your needs. It could be helpful to you and others to have a wide variety of resources available. If things offend you, how would the next person learn and expand their understanding of diverse perspectives? They won't. Don't only think about yourself, think about others in the situation also, and recognize the value of having access to different materials.
1359	4336	2	3	I don't believe that we should censor or take away anything off of our library shelves that seems either offensive or inappropriate for viewers, but I wouldn't recommend it for the kids who are not ready for that sort of material until they are at the age of where they are ready for that sort of viewing. The reason why I say this is because that I believe and know that people sooner or later are going to see, hear, and go through that sort of viewing and/or experience sometime in their lives, it has happened to many people and it will continue to happen to everyone in their lives. The events that happen to many people are awful but yet are true, the **realities** that go around in the world should be known to other people and why, so people can know how to deal with the situation or at least know what to do; we should know how to go-by when certain events go through like an example: if a certain person of race and is minding his own business passes a group of race oppressors and they began offending him by words then he shouldn't worry. Because if a person is only going to constantly use words then you should know that he/she is just a weak person just trying to get on your nerves and won't do any physical harm to you. There are many **truths** that people don't like and try their best to hide it from others, but that would only make **those truths** worse for everybody and would lead them clueless if some people got exposed to what some people attend to hide; We shouldn't hide **realities** from others and keep them from not knowing what has happened or what is going on and leaving them clueless. I believe that nothing should be held back for the people who are ready to see or know what is going on, no matter how cruel or painful it is; they should know what it is and how to take care of themselves when they'll experience it at first hand, allowing them to be better prepared for the world and its harsh realities.
1360	4337	2	3	Censoring literature? We all know that language is the foundation of human legacy. Language is spoken to mean anything the speaker is trying to communicate. To take books from the shelves is to steal the words from the mouths of many great speakers. We have the obligation to keep the legacy that we have created alive. If something is forgotten, it is as if nothing happened. If nothing happened, it will reoccur- good or bad.  To hide away words from our children is wrong. If not by word of print, word of mouth will lead them to the same discoveries as they would have come to if reading it from a book. But even more importantly, what good is hiding the truth? When many speak of tragic incidences, they speak, 'lest we forget.' If we should not forget, why should the youth not learn? There is nothing in print that can not be conveyed in a different communication form.  Our legacy is written on the pages of literature. The books we read are the property of all humanity and should be read by all to educate us of our mistakes as well as our triumphs. A commonly debated topic in the world of censorship is 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.' Huckleberry Finn is a novel that displays what life was truly like in one of America's most racially barbaric times. One might argue the fact that it uses an offensive 'n' word more than a few times. To some Huckleberry Finn one might argue that Jim, the runaway slave that stood by Huck was loved by Huck. A book in Huckleberry Finn's time displaying a friendship between a black and a white man is truly a ground breaking feat. The 'n' word was common place in Huckleberry Finn's time period- a friendship between a black man and a white man was not. Is it really important that a child knows of just another offensive word that they are bound to discover eventually anyway, or is it more important that they learn that color of skin does not change a person? Do not take the opportunity for a child to learn what really matters away.  To take one book away is to take all of them away. Censoring one piece of literature opens the doors of debate for every other piece ever created. The world has seen what can happen when things get censored. During Hitler's dictatorship, nearly everything from the internet, to books, to newspwpers, to television programming, to movies, to music, to magazines were censored so only what the dictatorship wanted got through. The people were brainwashed, and those who were not rose up, and when they did they were shot down. Do not let the world come to that. We are better than that and our literature shows it.  In other words, to censor media and the literature that surrounds us, we deprive ourselves of education and freedoms that are critical to the well being of future generations. Do not hide the free speech of authors, do not hide our legacy from our children, do not let us make the same mistake that has been made before. Let us educate our children for the future of humanity. Let our legacy not repeat itself. Let us innovate and create a new, better world. Let us allow our words to flow freely, so our legacy can live on and inform the generations to come.
1361	4338	2	3	The Author Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does anyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I do believe certain materials, such as music, books, and movies shouldn't be on a childrens shelf to read, but rather on an adult shelf. I believe every author has his or her right to express ones self and to be accepted for that. We all have our own beliefs and standards that we would like others to respect even if we dont agree on there beliefs. If every book that was found offensive was taken of a shelf we would soon have no books left. The reason for that is because everyone finds certain thing offensive. Many children are intersted in certain thing and we cant hold them back from that unless it is inappropriate or goes againts family morals or valus such a religous beliefs. It would be a good thing to monater what your children are reading, wacthing and listening to. On the other hand adult shelfs will have many diffrent things that would be offensive to many diffrent people unlike childrens books. Writing is a way to show a persons expressions and what they stand for although it might not be pleasing to me or any other person. But what if we write a book and sombody does not like it then we wouldnt like it if they took it off the shelf; that would show direpect to a person who has thought long and hard on there work. Therefore, it is important to learn to stand proud on what you believe, respecting others' views, and ensuring children have access to safe, family-friendly materials, thus maintaining a balance between freedom of expression and responsible curation.
1362	4339	2	3	I'm against censorship for good reasons. Everyone is for censorship, but I'm on a different perspective. If you're not old enough to get a movie or a book, that's for a reason. On another note, if you are, then it shouldn't matter. People should have their own choice. If they want to go out and get a rated R movie and watch it with their kids, that's their own choice. It's definitely not the person who makes the movies' choice to censor cusswords and stuff out. That's why they make edited CDs so people can buy them instead. People have different beliefs, and whatever they believe in is how it should go; and if somebody else with different beliefs doesn't like that, then I guess they need to write a paragraph like I'm doing now. Also, people want everything censored out; eventually there isn't going to be nothing to read, watch, or listen to. So all you people that want everything censored, I hope you're happy when the world has nothing to do because of you, ultimately resulting in a bland and uninteresting society.
1363	4340	2	3	Censorship for the future kids of america. Personally I have read some disturbing books also watched some grotesque and twisted, disturbing rated R movies. Not even talking about all the messed up music I've heard so far in my lifetime. What it comes down to is a lot of the music today is about sex, drugs, money, and violent crimes and gangs. The movies have a rating system which helps out for little kids. Books any one can get from a public library and some are about murder, rape, gang, violence, and all the horrible reality of the devilish deeds in the world.  I personally don't have a kid but if I had a kid and he read a book that was bad or heard a dirty song with some of those lyrics and if he watched a rated R movie I would wanna file a complaint because that's not how I want my kid growing up. With a twisted mind and a vocabulary of a little punk with curse words every ten seconds coming out his mouth. Also I wouldn't want my kid kissing his mom with that kind of stuff coming out of his mouth.  But the government needs to keep all that stuff away from kids until they're old enough to go get it on their own like they need to be 17 to go see a rated R movie. That is how it should have always been, ensuring a more protected and innocent upbringing for our children.
1364	4341	2	3	I feel that materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Some people like offensive things that they have in the library. Some people would sometimes want to know about certain things that are offensive. Most people could be offensive to a lot of different things. Different people have different things that are offensive. What might be offensive to you probably is not offensive to me. People that don't like offensive things just shouldn't check it out, and people that like offensive things just could check it out. I feel that they just shouldn't be removed just because people don't like offensive things; they just shouldn't check it out. You just can't remove things that are offensive just because some people don't like offensive things. Everyone does have their own right, but some people like offensive things. I read a book that was offensive to me, but it told me how to react to the situation and how to overcome my situation. So some things might offend you, but some things you just have to read about it more because some things tell you how to overcome that situation, or it will tell you what to do about the situation you had been offended by. That's why I feel that you shouldn't remove offensive books, because the information within them can be helpful even if the initial exposure is uncomfortable.
1365	4342	2	3	Moving @IDEAS The @BOOKS @SUBJECTS In @LIFE! When you enter a library or a book store of course you will find @SUBJECTS that you like and dislike. You're opinion @MAY not be the same as someone else. Sometime you can feel a little bit uncomfortable with the situation and the way thing are going. People have diffrernt looks about different @SUBJECTS in this way of @LIFE. You are going to come across good @SUBJECTS, bad thing, happy @SUBJECTS, sad @SUBJECTS, @SUBJECTS you agree about, and @SUBJECTS you disagree about. I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else should not be removed if they are found offensive to anybody. The reason I state that is because if any of those items offened one person they might not be offensive to another. Different people have different intrest in many different @SUBJECTS. So therefore it should not be any reason that the materials should be removed from the shelves. Especially if they are not hurting anything or anyone physically. Speaking from personal experience there were many times i felt offened about certain @SUBJECTS. I feel that abortions can come off a bit harmful to a @LIFE that has not been born yet. Killing a child that has not experince the thing you have is not right. But some sometime the way i can feel can be alot different to other people. So who am I to tell another person what they can and can not do. That comes with voicing your own opinion. You can not change the way another person is thinking or feeling. If you find a book or anything like that hard to deal with it is crazy. Think about the @BOOKS situation that you might come across and can be offensive to you. It will be alot of times you will disagree or have an opinion but can not change or do anything about it. @SUBJECTS will be much easier and less @BOOKS if we sometimes deal with the difficullt @SUBJECTS in @LIFE. Ultimately, engaging with diverse viewpoints, even those we find challenging, fosters understanding and allows for personal growth, enriching our experience of life and promoting a more tolerant society.
1366	4343	2	3	No, they should not have the CDs, books, and etc. off the store shelves. They should leave them on the shelves, I think. They should only remove the old video games, and perhaps very outdated books and music that no longer sell. Keeping a diverse selection is important.
1367	4344	2	3	In many PUBLIC libraries across the nation, a numerous amount of books, magazines, movies and music aren't provided because they are found offensive. I do not believe this should happen because everybody is unique and MAY find different types of work offensive. Who is it that chooses these items to be taken out of libraries and why should they be the only ones to say what goes and what stays? Everybody is different in their own way and everyone has their own interests and opinions. Some people are athletic, gothic, preppy and nerdy. The library is open to anybody that wishes to enter. What happens if the people that choose what content is provided in the library, doesn't like scary books, so they take all of the scary books out? What if their is a person that only reads scary books? What then will they have to read? I bet if that person had the ability to choose what stays and what goes in the library, they would only have horror in the library. I do not believe that anybody should have the right to censor what content is provided in PUBLIC libraries. Everyone has their own opinion and interests so they should have everything open in libraries.  There is a reason that PUBLIC libraries are called PUBLIC. That means that it is open to anyone and everyone. There should be all kinds of different genres to read and all sorts of movies to choose from. Just because one person doesn't like a certain kind of genre, or doesn't find it appropriate for a certain viewing audience, does not mean that they can take it out of a PUBLIC library. That would be why there is such thing as sections in libraries. If you don't find a certain type of book appropriate, place it in the 'TEEN ADULT' section of your library. For example: STEPHEN KING, he is a very popular author to many different viewing audiences. His ideas are very different than most. He writes horror but displays gore and a lot of sexual content in his writing. It is his own writing style. If the people that choose what is in the libraries, don't find that appropriate or if they find it offensive, they should put it in the 'TEEN ADULT' sections or even the 'ADULT' section. It should be up to the childrens' parents what their kid is reading; not the library itself.  I do not believe that anyone should choose what is and isn't provided in libraries. Everybody is unique, different and have their own opinions on different things and ideas. If you remove a specific type of book, movie, magazine or music from a library, and it's the only kind a certain person reads, what then will they have to read? What if somebody took out the kind that only you like to read? What then will you do? If everybody had the choice and right to do this, I don't think that anything will be left in libraries. All genres of everything should be available to the PUBLIC. If you don't find a book appropriate, place it in the TEEN ADULT section of your library to still have it open to anybody. That would just be a big DISAPPOINTMENT to anybody who decides to pick it up and read it. You need to think of everybody, not just yourself, as censorship in libraries ultimately limits access to diverse perspectives and restricts intellectual freedom for all patrons.
1368	4345	2	3	Should books, magazines ect... really be censored, taken off a shelf in a library, just because you might find them offensive? Some of you who are reading this would say yes, but why? What would be the reason behind it? So to answer the first question I asked, my answer would have to be no, because a library is a public place for all ages, and each area is labeled or should be labeled the genre of book, magazine, ect.. it is. I myself read almost just about everything I can get my hands on, and for some people its the same way. Yes, I understand that if it is offensive to you that you probably would feel they should censor it, but what about those that it isn't offensive to? What would you say to them? How would you explain why it was offensive? Most of all how would you react if they held it against you?  If it was because of one person or a small group of people that one of my favorite books or series was censored, in all honesty I would be pretty ticked. Books are for everyone to read, they shouldn't not be able to read the books they love because they have been taken off the shelf. I think that if a person really doesn't like the book and finds it offensive should then just ignore it, and move on to find another book, they shouldn't have looked at it in the first place. Books will be offensive to some one some how, usually a book is written to target a certain group of people, for instance what if someone found the romance novels a lot of people love, offensive? What if that was all the person read? Well, the people who only read romance novels wouldn't have a book to read because, someone had them censored and taken off the shelves, which seems unfair.  Books have been written, to help teach, get away from the real world, create a place to go for a person with an imagination, give someone hope, mystery, excitement. Books aren't something that should be taken off a library shelf, they are a bit of something for some one who just loves to read. Yes, there would be books you don't want your kids, grandkids, nieces and nephews to read, but that can't be helped, you can't censor every book that you don't want them to read or find offensive for them. If you did there wouldn't be a single book on a library shelf. The library can be a place to foster thought and discussion, and banning books limits those opportunities.  So for those of you who have read this, think about it, when you pick up a book and find it offensive do you want to make someone else upset because you had it taken off the shelf? You never know when that might happen to you, think about it before you go and tried to do that to a book. Consider the impact of limiting access to information and diverse perspectives, because at the end of the day, reading is a personal journey, and we should respect each individual's right to choose what they read.
1369	4346	2	3	I don't believe that any certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc; Should be removed from the libraries shelves, because anything can be offensive. What if someone needed to research about the Civil War? Well they really won't be able to, if all the books about the Civil War were taken off the shelves, only because someone found it offensive. Now days, everything is offensive to somebody. For this, people need to understand that it is what it is, and if you were not apart of that problem, then what do you need to worry about. This day and age is evil all around the world. There are going to be things happening that are going to make people feel a little offensive. Just like all the earthquakes around the world, I know that there is some people offensive about that, but what if somebody was in college, and they wanted to learn more about what happened, so maybe they can get a group of people, and make there lives better. People are hurting and I understand that, but us people are not here to judge, we are here to help the poor, and the sick, get by with what they have, and just help them see that there is a way out. With all this said I don't believe that we should remove the books, music, movies, and magazines off the shelves in libraries, because censorship limits access to information and ultimately hinders learning and progress.
1370	4347	2	3	When I go to the library, most of the time, I'm doing research on a specific topic. The information I want is the facts that really happened, or took place. This would not be possible if they censored all the material that offended somebody. Leaving libraries uncensored gives us the full effect of what we're reading or researching. It is important for readers and researchers to connect and take in all the information they read; that is what keeps us interested in what we are doing. Authors write the things they write for a reason. Taking their hard work off the shelves because some little thing offends someone is not fair to them. Besides, either way, someone is getting offended, because the author is going to get offended for taking their hard work off the shelves. As you can tell, I am against censoring our libraries. The way I see it is that if something offends you, then don't look at it. Censoring the library limits access to information and silences voices, ultimately hindering the pursuit of knowledge and understanding for everyone.
1371	4348	2	3	I disagree with library censorship. Every person should be allowed to produce their reflection of their beliefs or ideas. If certain books found offensive were to be removed from libraries then there would be nothing left for anyone to read. If parents are concerned with what their children are checking out from the library to read then they should read it before their child to see if they think it is appropriate. In my opinion children should be able to read whatever they like and by doing that they can teach themselves many things. Books can also help children to escape from everyday life. Admittedly, children should not always escape, or use reading to hide from real life, but occasionally they need to. I know as a young child when things were not going so well I could always turn to reading to get my mind off of the bad things. If children are allowed these escapes they can do better on their school work and with their peers. Reading can help a child to expand their imaginations. If a child reads a couple times a day it is proven that said child will do better in life. No one likes boring people, and how can you be boring with such a wide imagination? It is impossible! In recent online polls, parents whose children can access books say that their children do better in school and in everyday life. By reading, these children can easily expand their vocabularies. With this knowledge they can learn with less difficulty and can excel in academics with ease. Such reading can also cultivate critical thinking. In conclusion, if certain books are censored from the libraries they will be unavailable for children to read. Children need books to provide an escape, to expand their imaginations, and to help them in school and life, fostering a lifelong love of learning. Do not let libraries censor books!
1372	4349	2	3	Some materials in libraries @MONTH1 have information that is offensive towards others. But should they be removed if they are found offensive? Some people believe that they should be removed depending on how bad the offense is. But materials @MONTH1 be removed if it is sexual, racist, or life threatening offense. Some material @MONTH1 have offensive comments that is sexual. If its an offense that is sensored and the author or artist of the material went too far, then that @MONTH1 be a good reason for the material to be removed. It @MONTH1 make the person feel emotions that bring them down. It @MONTH1 also make the person feel violated and offended. The sensitive content could create an uncomfortable and hostile environment. There @MONTH1 be material that has racist comments. Racism is one of the biggest conflicts in the world today. It is something that starts fights and arguements. It also causes individuals to feel bad about themselves. Racism can cause people to feel very hurt also. So if there is too much racism in a material, then that should be removed. There are some material that @MONTH1 have offense that seems life threatening. Say that it is a book about the whole nation and the author slips in something that @MONTH1 seem like the nation would be in danger, someone @MONTH1 feel offended and want that material removed. Material with too much threat in it @MONTH1 make one feel like their life is in danger or like something bad is going to happen. They would feel a life threatening offense and want it to be removed from the shelves. So should offensive materials be removed from the shelves? Yes they should. If they were to be found sexually, life threatening offense or had racist comments, they should be removed so individuals won't feel these offenses are life threatening, hurtful, or cause negative emotions, fostering a more inclusive and respectful environment for all library patrons.
1373	4350	2	3	Taking 'offensive' books from the shelves of libraries is like taking away the right of speech. There is not a point to it. People in this country have the right of speech. Along with that comes the right to have your voice be heard. An author's opinions may be offensive to some but does that mean he or she should not have a voice? Writers get their ideas from somewhere; society plays a huge role in what ideas these authors conjure up. Taking these books away will not change the way people think and feel, and most importantly citizens of this nation have the right to make their own choices; that being if you don't like a book don't check it out. Writers often state things that to some degree might offend one in a million people. Others see it as freedom of speech and writing. An author who writes a story that involves sex is not trying to extend their writing and thoughts to second graders. But if a person has a problem with the way the author sees the world, simply walking out their front door will show that same thing. Some books may be fictional, but that does not mean they don't get ideas from somewhere else. Society plays a big part in the ideas and thoughts of most writers. So when they write a book that has 'inappropriate' actions in it, they got it from the way people truly are in the world. Banning a book from the library that has a sex scene or provocative language does not --by any means-- make the world stop having sex and saying curse words. Kids are learning this through hearing their parents swear or their peers in class talking about sex. Reading a book about it will not change the fact that they are still learning about it in many other ways. If the books that swear were no longer on library shelves, society still will not change. There is no perfect society. Setting a book on a shelf with offensive language does not cause harm to anyone. If an individual doesn't like the way an author expresses themselves through their writing that person should not check that author's books out from the library. No single person is forced to read a book they are offended by. Getting rid of a book because of an unhappy parent does nothing but waste paper and intelligence. The library is not liable for the feelings of the readers. If the reader does not like the book they are able to close it. No one has glued their fingers to it. Many people in today's world would agree that banning books from our public libraries will not have as much of an effect as some would like it to. Banning books is an unknowledgeable thing to do to keep your kids from learning bad things. Society shows that the writers are getting their ideas from somewhere; taking these books away will not take away the way people think and behave, and if someone does not like a book they should not read it, which suggests that censorship through book banning is ultimately an ineffective and unnecessary measure.
1374	4351	2	3	One could understand why some would wish to censor libraries and remove all rude, unwanted, or offensive forms of media from their shelves. However, one must take into account that, as Katherine Paterson said, if one person has 'the right to remove that [a] book from the shelf...then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' With that thought in mind, do we honestly think that censorship of libraries is a smart idea? If everyone was able to pick and choose which books to be taken off the shelf or which music to ban, then we would have nothing left. You simply cannot please everyone. Are there benefits? Of course, there are benefits. One certainly wouldn't want one's child exposed to certain material at a young age. But one must not censor libraries! If one wishes, as a responsible parent, that their child keep away from a particular book or movie, they should take that matter into their own hands and not condemn the book off the shelf. By condemning the book, one condemns the author. As an AMERICAN, one has the freedom of speech, and this applies to media as well. The author has the right to author a book that some INDIVIDUALS view as offensive, and no one has the right to remove his or her right from the standing. Paper burns at 451 degrees FAHRENHEIT. In the classic novel by Ray Bradbury, FAHRENHEIT 451, the protagonist struggles through life in a world antagonized by the banning and burning of books. The story takes place in the future; however, it contains an interesting undertone that hints at the possibility that this 'future' MAY be nearer than first imagined. To be blunt, the protagonist's life is horrible; he lives in a world that bans books, yet he is quite the bibliophile. He is employed as a fireman, not to clear fires, but to create them. Ray Bradbury's firemen are responsible for the delicate task of book burning, which is a rather frequent occurrence. However, with the main character's love for literature, how can he burn books? Throughout the novel, the character tries to come to terms with himself and attempts to put an end to the madness, only to be forced out of civilized society. The book is frightening but an amazing read: it emphasizes the dire reality of censorship. It's everywhere. Now, one certainly doesn't need to worry about Ray Bradbury's futuristic hell coming to life any time soon. But one should know the dangers of censorship. No one person has the right to remove a book from the shelves that they feel is offensive, let alone ban it entirely. The banning of books is a banning of freedom: freedom of speech, freedom of ideas, freedom of thought. Another dystopian world that comes to mind is the world of George Orwell's 1984. Though, granted, our society is certainly not headed for that any time soon, if ever, it is still a valid point. Once some freedoms are removed, others will follow. Libraries should remain entirely intact, forever. Every person, every man, woman, and child should have ample access to knowledge. Whether this knowledge be gained through books, magazines, movies, or music, it needs to be readily available. Instead of banning certain media, one should label said media with a warning. Parents should have enough sense to pay attention, and thus, the problem is solved. Censorship is wrong, censorship is unnecessary, and there are a plethora of alternative means for protection against potentially 'offensive' media; thus, the case can rest with the knowledge that all forms of media need to be available, no matter what the content.
1375	4352	2	3	There are many books out there that parents would not want their children reading. Some books have violence and crimes, others have love and romance. But it is not the best idea to use censorship in libraries. There are many books out there that might not be good for children to read, but it might help them make better choices in real life. Also, we can not forget about freedom of the press. With freedom of the press anyone can write about anything they want. They can write about the good, the bad, violence, crimes, love, and romance. Everyone has their own way of writing and their own imagination. Without imagination what fiction would there be for children to read. There would be nothing to write about without imagination. Without imagination there wouldn't be any storytelling or creativity. With censorship, there would not be any books on the library shelves for children to read.  If the libraries were to censor the books on the shelves there would not be any books to read because every book has something to censor. Whether it is swearing, guns, killing, romance, or love. There is something in every book that is inappropriate for children to read. If the libraries were to censor the books on the shelves there would nothing left to read, and the intelligence of children would drop dramatically. They would be limited to only the most basic stories, and their critical thinking skills would suffer.  Children read for many reasons, like to expand their minds and to enter a world where the book takes place. But what children might not know is that reading also strengthens their vocabulary. When children read they learn many new words that are in that book. While they are reading the book opens their mind to much more then what they are used to and normally around everyday. When they are reading the children expand the minds and also helps them with everyday situations. This is why I do not believe that censorship in libraries is not a great idea.  If libraries censorship books and everything else on the shelves there would be nothing left for children at the libraries. They would be stuck reading books where they do not learn anything. They would read the same books over and over, they wouldn't learn anything new. There wouldn't be anything the could expand their minds with. That is something we certainly do not want for our community or anywhere for that matter. Therefore, allowing children access to a wide range of books, even those with potentially challenging content, is essential for their intellectual growth and development.
1376	4353	2	3	The scary book that you don't want your children to pick up off the shelf, I think if your kids read it they would be scared, having nightmares, and you probably don't want that. And if you have the right to move it, your kids will have the right to move it because they see what you do; they're going to want to do so too. It might be best to do it when they are not around. And yes, I believe that certain materials, particularly those with intense or frightening content, are better kept out of reach until they're older, showing how parental discretion can help manage a child's exposure.
1377	4354	2	3	Have you ever picked up a piece of material while in a library and it offended you? Would you want your children reading, watching, or hearing stuff that was offensive towards them? I don't think no parent wants that. Think about it, how do children have access to things like that? Is it all around or do children go and find it? Not every single child in our community is going to be protected from bad materials. Most of the time after school, children stay in the house and do stuff instead of going outside. Inside of their house they have access to televison, computers, and music. They think why go outside when I have all this stuff inside? Truth be told children hear so much harmful things from everywhere and anywhere. Nothing is censored like it was back in the day. Now a days nobody cares if materials are offensive, just as long as they sell. That's not the way it suppose to be at all, everybody should want best for the children and young teens. People wonder why their is violence, bad attitudes, crimes, etc., because all the stuff we have access to. Schools could help prevent this probelm by removing offensive materials off the shelves in the libraries. It's sad that type of material is available in a school, but thats how the generation is today. In a library only certain things should be done: Reading, using computers, working at a table. Children shouldn't be able to get on a computer and play games, or listen to music with bad words in it, or prehaps pick up a dirty magazine. Library should be a place for learning, doing work, and reading. If their is less offensive materials in a school enviorment that's one step into fixing this problem. Censorship is much needed everywhere, it would help out a lot, creating a safer and more nurturing environment for our youth.
1378	4355	2	3	The common phrase 'knowledge is power' accurately paints the situation at hand. Through censorship in libraries, which are meant to allow free access to all media-related materials, we take away the opportunity for people to empower themselves through knowledge. The reasons for not censoring media in libraries are numerous and include, but are not limited to, unconstitutionality of censorship, the lack of proper definition for 'offensive', and the contradiction censorship poses to the core of what a library is. The first, and most blatant, reason for not allowing the censorship of materials in libraries is the unconstitutionality of the matter. Freedom of speech and freedom of press are both protected by the constitution upon which our country was founded. Censorship of said materials will effectively undermine both of these rights. Authors, illustrators, journalists and the slew of other individuals who compose the materials available in libraries are exercising their right to free speech through their works. They are constitutionally protected in the things they say. Notice that Americans have a right to free speech and not a right to free speech so long as no one is offended. The freedom of press is the means by which they share their ideas and concepts with the world. They are utilizing their free speech by means of press. Censoring library materials would be limiting the means by which artists can share their ideas with citizens of the United States. This would be a clear failure to uphold the rights of the citizens. For this reason, we cannot censor libraries. The constitutional concept of equality of man plays into the situation as well. There is no adequate legal definition of 'offend'. People could be offended by something as serious as a personal attack on their beliefs and personal entity or something as light as a personal distaste for certain mindsets and ideas. So, because all men are equal, we would have to respect the 'offense' taken by all people and to all degrees. This leaves every single work of art, whether it be a book, movie, magazine or any other form provided by libraries, open to the fickle definition of offensive and vulnerable to the personal feelings of every individual. If said offense taken by individuals to works is able to mark a work as 'offensive' and thus make it open to removal from libraries, we are effectively allowing citizens to undermine the rights of other citizens. This is something that cannot be allowed in our libraries. The final core issue is the essence of censorship versus the essence of a library. Censorship is meant to create a politically correct and non-offensive environment through the limitation of exposure to materials. Libraries, however, are meant to allow public access to works that stretch and challenge knowledge, beliefs, notions and all ideas held by people through the works of others. Censorship cannot be implemented without a clash with the essence of a library's purpose. If censorship were to be enacted, a library could not provide new information if someone else did not like what was being taught. A library could not provide works that challenge and stretch individual beliefs if someone was offended by the means by which the stretching occurred. Pre-conceived notions could not be defeated with the presence of factual knowledge if someone did not like the truth. In all of these ways, and many more, a library's core ideals and purpose could not be upheld with the induction of a system of censorship. All in all, we can see that censorship could only hope to destroy the system libraries abide by. The constitutional rights of citizens would be infringed upon, the fickle nature of humans and the lack of definition for 'offensive' would allow people to undermine the rights of others, and the essence of what a library really is would be ravaged. We cannot, as Americans with rights, employ a system of censorship.
1379	4356	2	3	I think kids should be able to read what they want. Kids should never get told no when it comes to learning. Plus, there is not a bad book that your kids will find at school anyway. Why should kids not be allowed to watch and read what they want? This is how we learn and grow. Unless it was of adult content, which would be against the law for them to get, haha. Our kids' minds are not something we should waste on things that they don't want to read anyway. When a kid starts to hate his or her work, it starts a long chain of hating school and the books inside it, ultimately hindering their educational journey and passion for reading.
1380	4357	2	3	I don't think that certain materials in books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves because I think that everyone has the right to say what they want to say, but I do think some things in books, movies, and music that might be appropriate for a high school student aren't appropriate for an elementary school student. Some things can be really offensive to elementary school students but not so much to high school students, it would just depend on what they are reading, watching, and hearing. I've never experienced anything offensive in what i've read in any book before but I have experienced some in music i've heard. I didn't say really anything about it I just thought someone shouldn't have written this certain song that I was listening to and I didn't think it would really be that bad. It's mostly in rap music that i've heard that's really offensive and I think shouldn't have been even written. But I still think everyone has a right to say what it is that they are wanting to say, although I do believe some content is better suited for more mature audiences.
1381	4358	2	3	We all have our favorite books and some we like others do not. Have you ever walked into the library in hope of finding your all time favorite book that you nearly forgot about, or maybe a book a friend recomended to you? What happens when you get there and the book has been censored? Most books we see in our public or school libraries are books that are well liked or are favorites of many. Books open a new world to everyone and should not be taken away. To begin, I will explain some problems in our libraries. Some people believe the books and magazines in our libraries should be censored and removed from the shelves because it could be offensive to some people because of racial slurs or comments. This is a big problem because most books written years ago took place long ago like *To Kill a Mockingbird* for example, may be considered offensive but, this book gives a glimpse of what was going on in this time period and without it some people would never know what happened and we couldn't learn from those mistakes and make better choices in the future. Some books that are censored have great educational value. Everyone has there prefrence on books and what some say should be taken away because of what they think others do not. If all books that are bad or offencive were taken off the shelves then eventually we would have no books left. We have the right to read any book out there no matter how horrendus it may be, besides you can go to church and read worse things that are being censored out of our libraries. If we couldn't read some books like many classics it would take educational value away from us all. Think about all the books we have read and learned from that have the possibility of being censored. Before someone gets into a book they should read the informational part on the back to see what it is about before they start to read something not suited for them. I believe that no book should be censored and should have the freedom to sit on a shelf and be read by anyone who wants to read it. Being censored is not protecting anyone it only makes things worse. If someone feels offended then they shouldn't read it, it's their choice to pick it up or not. Hopefully I have persuaded you that no book should be censored and everyone has the right to read what they want, as restricting access undermines the very purpose of libraries and the pursuit of knowledge.
1382	4359	2	3	Killings, murders, and homosexual books can all be offensive to one person or another, but that doesn't mean they should be taken away. That is like saying I get offended by homework, take it out of school. Some of the most interesting books to read are about murders, I think. I believe they shouldn't be taken out or else no teenage kids would read in school. Teenages like to have mystery and romance. I know that one of my favorite books, The Hunger Games, would offend some people because it has murder in it. That certainly doesn't mean it was not a good and interesting book for me. They can just overlook these books and pick another. If you want to keep your school students interested you shouldn't take out books that might offend someone. By taking out some books not everyone would be happy. Some kids might not even read any more because you took the best books out of the library. Every book in one way or another would offend someone. They just need to overlook those books and read a different one. I have seen some books at my school that offended me, but i did not tell the librarian to take it out of the school. Another student might have loved to read that book. Everyone has different opinions so there would not be any books left if they took out all the offensive ones. The only books that would be left would be Clifford the Big Red Dog and children books. I do not know of any school student that would want to read Clifford the Big Red Dog and give a speech about it in class. I'm not sure how the teachers could do book reports any more; all the books we read in class could offend someone. If everything that offended someone was taken out of the school there would be nothing left of the school. See everyone has a different opinion on everything. That just isn't right. In conclusion, books that offend someone shouldn't be taken out of schools and libraries. They keep the school students reading and growing. Without some of these books I myself wouldn't like reading, so let's be mature adults and keep all the books on the shelves and ignore the books that offend us.
1383	4360	2	3	Censoring any type of media such as books, magazines, movies, or music from a library is not right. A library is a huge amount of information put in common places for people to seek out knowledge. When something is found offensive, you should not hide it away as though it was never there. If any media is offensive, it should be the person who is looking up the information to choose if he/she wants to use it. When someone, for example a child, has something offensive, the first thought is to take it away from the library or television. Instead, just explain what it is they're looking at, and they will eventually understand the reason it is offensive, but how does someone know what is offensive or not? Just because something is found offensive by one or two people does not make it right to just take it away. It should be talked about or discussed by groups of people on the subject, then decided whether or not it should be taken off the shelves for being offensive. If there is a book or magazine on the shelf and it might be offensive, it should be a decision made by the people surrounding that type of information to take it off the shelf and not to be hidden away; ultimately, access to information should be preserved, allowing individuals to form their own opinions.
1384	4361	2	3	"Are offensive materials offensive to everybody? Does everyone think the same material is offensive? Who is to say what is or is not offensive? Offensive material can be anything someone wants to think of. Children are going to see this material anyways, whether we take it away or not. Offensive material, such as cursing or rage, is a form of expression and of relieving stress. Such things can also show anger, hate, and depression. Children will see and hear offensive things anyways. Even as it is now, parents try to hide such things from their children; this makes them curious, and they will do anything to understand it. Offensive things are part of everyday life, and the more you hide it, the more children will seek it out.  In movies, books, and music, this is a form of expression. It relieves stress, rage, and shows this so that *the audience* is given a true picture of what is going on. People cannot imagine someone truly angry in a book when it says, ""... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You don't know what you have done!'..."" You cannot show foreshadowing, or show the anger. You cannot see how a character truly feels. For example, ""... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You will perish! You don't know what you have done! Death will come!'..."" *Now*, you have an idea of how the author will play out the story and how the character really feels. You can see the foreshadowing. The author could be saying that a good man has died, who was going to stop evil, or an evil man died, and people will revenge him.  In such ways, this can show anger. Some people would find the example offensive or out of line. Cursing to me is not offensive, but it shows how the character, writer, or singer feels when it was written without it having to state it. Offensive material can also express grief. This shows that someone is hurt by what has happened, amplifying the story, allowing the reader, watcher, or listener to expect more and want more. So the reader, watcher, or listener would wait for more, and by the music, book, or movie, it puts interest into the material.  Only certain people can agree on something offensive, such as family, friends, or a group of close people, but it applies foreshadowing, interest, anger, grief, and sometimes, passion. Your children will see it if they truly want to, so why get rid of something that they will see anyways? Why remove something that interests them and makes them want to read more, watch or make movies, or listen to or make music? Why would something that, yes, is offensive to some, but would grab, promote, and keep some within it, be censored, when it can be a powerful form of expression and engagement?"
1385	4362	2	3	I don't think something should be taken off the bookshelf just because it offends someone or you dislike it. Just because you don't like something or you don't approve of the reading material doesn't mean it should be taken away. If it was like that, then there wouldn't be any reading material or books or magazines.  In my opinion, if it offends you in some way or another, then don't read it. Plain and simple. Because I'm sure that there are thousands of books, magazines, newspapers, etc., that offend a lot of people every day.  I don't mean to be harsh in any way; that's just the way I feel. This is only my opinion and that's how I feel about this situation, so ultimately, the choice to read something should remain with the individual.
1386	4363	2	3	"Have you ever thought about why teenagers are changing each day? Sometimes parents don't pay attention to why this is happening, because they think their kids are growing up, or because they need more freedom, or even because they need more time. When time passes, they stop and think, ""What happened to my kids? Why are they changing so much?"" But they don't know why we behave like that. You have to stop that, because we are changing because of what we see in magazines, movies, and books, and also music; sometimes music has offensive words that we learn. But also music, books, magazines, and movies are good, but only when they don't have offensive words or bad things in them. Sometimes they affect us in a good way, but the majority of the time they affect us in a bad way because we learn bad things. Sometimes little kids read books with bad and offensive words. I remember when my friend and I were 8 years old, she started reading books with offensive words, and her mom got mad at her. After that, she started insulting her mom and calling her names, and her mom was feeling bad, but she didn't know why her daughter was acting bad. The next day I went to their house, and I told her mom that she was reading bad books and watching movies with offensive words, and I told her mom where she was hiding all those books and movies. When she got home, I was there, and her mom had all the books and movies in her hand, and she gave me a bad look, and she told me that I was a bad friend because I told her mom. I started crying because she made me feel bad, but she didn't know that I was doing it for her own good. Before I moved to Los Angeles, she went to my home and she said, ""I am sorry because I treated you like that,"" and I told her that I did it because I loved her and because she was like my sister since we were little. We started crying; now we are still best friends. These days, little kids know everything, and it is because of what they watch and see. You can help us by taking all of the bad and offensive words out of the books, movies, and magazines, so we can learn positive values and behaviors that will help us to become someone important in life."
1387	4364	2	3	Ok some books can be really offensive and some magazines can be bad like this one sports magazine i read talked about some atheletes and their accidents. like one article was talking about @PERSON1 playing basket ball and he had the stomach flu and he was having a hard time playing cause he had to use the bathroom alot.'I mean who would want to let the world know that they used the bathroom on themselves'. thats bad! And another thing why do libraries have books that have sexual things in them. Theres quiet a few books that are like that for an example theirs this book called 'wake' and its about a girl who gets pulled into other peoples dreams like there was this girl who had a dream and it was sexual i thought wow why is this book in here. It also had alot of cursing in it i enjoyed it but I think it should be removed from the librarie. Cause theres kids that arent of age so they should'nt read them. I don't know thats all I have to say right now other then look at what your kids read theses days you might get upset because some content can be inappropriate, and it's important to be mindful of the material available to children.
1388	4365	2	3	Katherine stated that if everyone had the right to take a book off the shelf then there wouldn't be any books left. I think what she is saying is that many people think of a book that is innappropriate, but in another persons eye the book could also be appropriate. Censorship is a big deal no-a-days. Nobody wants there young children to read about drugs and/or violence. I have many opinions upon this issue. First I will state why I think the books, or movies, or whatever should be taken off the shelf. The books, movies, magazines, ect. should be taken off the shelf for being to innappropriate. The books and movies are innappropriate by having drugs, sex, violence, and many other things in them that young children shouldn't be subject to watching or reading. I know if I was a parent I would not want my young child reading of a violent murder, or gangs. The other thing about censorship that it is the peoples choice to read an innappropriate book, or watch an innappropriate movie. As a kid myself that is growing up, I didn't really care for reading anyways, but the books that were the best sometimes were the ones with violence in them. Also even thought the book *might* be innappropriate, the child still should have a say in what they are reading. This is where my next thought comes in. You have to think about the kids that are mature too. The kids that are mature, and it is just a hobby to read, *might* not have any books of their style left to read if they were all 'taken of the shelf'. This goes for parents too. If they have a book at their house, the child could easily pick it up and read it there. What the book stores, libraries, and movie stores should do, is put an age limit on the books and movies. I know that for @CAPS1 rated movies there is an age limit, but for explicit books i do not think there is an age limit. They could also maybe even get a letter or a note with parent concent on it, so the children could get the book or magazine. Maybe the parent should even just come in and get the book or movie for the child. The libraries, or book stores, or movie stores could also easily put a warning on the side of the cover to show that the book *might* be innappropriate to some. What the children read is only up to two people: the child and the parent. If the parent doesn't care that the child is reading or watching an innappropriate movie then it should be no problem. Therefore, I think in order to withhold the buying and selling of books, there has to be the option to obtain the innappropriate ones. I feel that even though the material *might* be explicit, the kids, with their parent's concent, should have the option to check out or buy mostly anything. Afterall, the book *might* be about violence, drugs, or sex, but the children are still reading which is always good. Ultimately, it comes down to parental guidance and responsible choices to ensure a balance between freedom of access and protecting young minds.
1389	4366	2	3	I do agree with this topic at hand, some of the material that is being displayed on the shelves at our local library is inappropriate or sometimes vulgar. Way too many people get away with way too many things in this day and age. Our society we live in is just a total wreck and complete, utter disaster. Something has to be done to put an end to this madness.  Someone would think that if a librarian put an inappropriate book up on the shelf, that it is inevitable that a child or someone irresponsible would find the book. Yet we still witness children reading or looking at a book, type of media, or entertainment that is not suitable for their age group. Sometimes adults find books that are not pleasing; why would we put them on a shelf to be publicly displayed? That is a question that I have yet to find the solution to.  I got home from school a couple of days ago and I heard this hip-hop music coming from my nine-year-old sister's room. I started to listen to the lyrics and they were absolutely awful, she was singing about drugs, sex, and alcohol. I went in her room and turned it off and questioned her where she got the CD from. She replied 'the library.'  That's just another example of what I'm speaking about. If someone at the age of nine can check out a CD like that, then imagine what is available to me at the age of sixteen. Adolescents do not need those kinds of thoughts and words in their vocabulary. I'm just afraid for the next generation; what are they going to be listening to? What are they going to be reading?  And it's not just the library, it's everywhere! We can't even live a day of our lives in this society without hearing something bad on the radio, on TV, or even in public. Everywhere we turn is something bad or vulgar. So we need to think about ourselves and our children and try to clean up our acts a little bit. We need to stand up for what's appropriate and what's right, and work towards creating a more wholesome environment for ourselves and future generations.
1390	4367	2	3	I don't believe that we should remove any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from our libraries due to many reasons. This is the real world and the things you read about or watch in a movie may be something you don't want your kids to read about or even see. Life is about learning new things. To learn about these ideas, you usually read about or see them somewhere. The only way I would ever remove any of these items from a store is if they were going to seriously harm the people or have a negative effect on them. If I were to walk into a public library and I saw a book about a girl cutting herself or someone killing another person, I would be the type of person to turn away from it; even though it is what many kids are reading about today. Of course, every library has books that cover all kinds of topics. If you were a parent that was worried about your child reading about these kinds of things, well welcome to life. Most books have a true story behind them and I believe that everyone needs to learn about this kind of stuff sometime in their life. Most of what we learn today comes from the books we read, providing context and different perspectives.  Also, everyone today listens to music. We find music as a way to relax and have a good time whether you're riding in a car or at a party. Many of the songs today contain foul language and have sexual meanings, but that doesn't mean that you have to listen to them. Many older people don't want to listen to these kinds of songs but it is what many kids are listening to today. What many people don't see though, is that these songs have true meaning behind them and it is really a way of life, reflecting current social issues and personal experiences.  Finally, I believe that magazines, movies, and any other types of media, shouldn't be removed from libraries. Many people turn to magazines as a way to relax and read about the latest fashions or their favorite athlete. We watch movies to also relax and have a good laugh every once in a while. No one should remove these sources of entertainment from our people even if some think they are inappropriate.  I strongly believe that removing any books, magazines, movies, music, or any other typed of media would have a negative effect on a lot of people. You would be removing sources of entertainment and ways of learning from people. How would you feel if you went to your local library one day and most, if not all, materials had been removed? What would you do if you didn't have any of these materials available to you anymore, limiting access to information and diverse viewpoints that contribute to a well-rounded understanding of the world? Therefore, maintaining a wide range of materials is essential for fostering intellectual growth and freedom of expression.
1391	4368	2	3	"I believe that the book that none of us read should not be on the shelf of any bookstore; if grown-ups do read it, no child should have the right to. Also, some of the music on shelves should be removed from all stores. Children under the age of @NUM1 shouldn't have access to some of this rated R music; certain music shouldn't be on shelves for little kids to get a hold of.  So now let's get to the movies that are playing in some of these shows. No child under @NUM1 should be able to see half of the things that are showing in movies because no child should be exposed to such things that grown-ups are most likely exposed to. That is another way that young children are doing half of the things they are doing; the people that make certain movies need to think about the children and how they would act toward the things they make.  Most magazines that are being sold today are giving children the wrong idea. When magazines are filled with a lot of ""he said, she said"" things, the kids in the world do nothing but think it's real or okay to do; that is sending the wrong message to the young children. And I know you are thinking to yourself, like, how is that true? Well, kids these days listen to whatever they think is right, and half of these magazines make things sound so real, contributing to the negative influences on children."
1392	4369	2	3	I think people use books from Mexico, that work you have is right. When you hope our people write good, it is important. I like book reading time when my finals happen. Many people like reading books. Much people go to bookstores, and my finals, so you're right to call me for more information. If a book will be scored fairly in school, it should have conventions to help people benefit from the contents because it helps many people look forward to a special occasion, like a show or party, when it finally happens, and sometimes it is really like a book. When I came to school, I was not reading naturally, so I go to my room. Reading one book is good for you, so I read. I like one book; I read it. So, when I go on vacation, I pack two books, so I read in the Rancho. When I get back to school, I like book reading during my finals. You like books? Yes, why? It is good reading. I see my friend; he likes to read one book too much. Therefore, reading is a great way to learn and enjoy ourselves.
1393	4370	2	3	No I as an @CAPS1 cetazine do not feel that any materials should be removed. There are many reason I feel this way and I hope that after people have read this they will agree with me. THere are three main points supporting my opinion and i plan to list them below. First and for most is the fact that this is @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is suposed to be the land of the free and the home of the brave, or at least thats what the national anthem tells me. So to me if some one removes a book or movie from a library becasue they find it offencive they are trying to take away one of my right as an @CAPS1 cetacine. The right they are messing with to me is the right of freedom. I should be free to be able to walk into a library and grab any book i wish. I should be free to go to the movie store and find and rent any movie a choose from the shelf. If they put a movie or book away if they make it to were i can't get to it then they are messing with my freedom, and this is somthing i can't stand as an @CAPS1. I should be free to read or watch what ever i choose to. Which brings me to my next point. This point is a simple and logical one. My second point is that people have the choice to read or watch the movie. Just because it is there it does not meen that they have to read or watch it. If someone doesn't like a book good for them don't read it. If someone doesn't like a movie good for them don't watch it. It is rather quit simple in my opinion if someone doesn't like said book or movie then just leave it alone and don't mess with it. They shouldn't have the right to ruin it for everone else. Just because one or two or even twenty people find a book offencive doesn't mean they have the right to remove it. There @MONTH1 five million other people out their who love said book so why ruin for everyone just to make a few people happy. They do have the right to say no and not read or watch the movie, but they don't have the right to say i can't. Finaly people say that said book or movie should be removed because a child might get it and it is not apropreat for children. Well to that I have to say it is the parents job to make sure a child is not readind or watching something they shouldn't. If i child gets a hold of a book that is said to be bad it is the parents job to tell them to put it back. People don't have the right to completly remove said book or movie just because a kid might get it. So there is my opinion on this little matter. I don't feel that libraries should be censored. I feel we all have the right o make own decisions and that we have the right to read or watch what ever we choose. It is not fair to get ride of a book just because a few people don't like it. Hundreds of othes might love it, and like I said before if someone doesn't like a certain movie or book then don't read it or watch it. Don't ruin it for everyone else though. Ultimately, maintaining access to diverse materials, while acknowledging parental guidance, ensures that everyone retains the freedom to explore different perspectives and make informed choices for themselves.
1394	4371	2	3	"Many people have different views on different types of things. There is not much that can be helped with that. No one can never make everybody happy. That is a major part of life. I do not think they should remove materials from libraries just because some people find them offensive. You cannot make everyone happy, some people enjoy those materials, and everyone is entitiled to their own opinion. The first reason they should not remove offensive materials from the library is because you will not make everybody happy by doing that. Just because some people take offense to certain things, does not mean that everyone does. If they do not like it, they do not have to read it or listen to it. They have libraries so you can pick out books (and other materials) that you like. You have a choice there. There are lots of books that are at libraries around the world. People are going to be mad whether they are there or not. Have you ever heard the saying ""Don't judge a book by its cover?"" Well, that could also be a reason people want materials removed. They might see a 'suggestive' cover or something, and they might take total offense to that. Just because a cover of a book might make people take offense to it doesn't mean they should remove it. The second reason offensive materials should not be removed is because it is enjoyable for some people. There is a reason it is in the library, and that reason is because some people enjoy it. If there was a book or magazine that never got checked out, do you think they would keep it? Nope. I am pretty sure if it never got checked out, they would get rid of it. Obviously someone has to read, listen, or watch it. People get offended by things everyday. Removing 'offensive' materials from libraries will not be much help to the problem. It might help a little, but there are still going to be people who get offended so easily. The third reason they should keep materials is because everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Just because some people think that there are offensive materials in the library does not mean other people do. For some people, taking away things like that would be like making kids at school wear uniforms. It takes away freedom. We are living in America. America is supposed to be a free country. It is really not a free country when you have people taking away books and movies because they are offensive to people. I got news for you. If you don't like it, don't read it. There is no harm at all by keeping materials on shelves. No matter what, someone is always going to take offense to something. The world is not perfect, and it is never going to be perfect. Taking materials off the shelves because it is offensive to some people isn't going to make the world a better place; it will only limit the resources available and create unnecessary censorship."
1395	4372	2	3	Some books are offensive but not all of them. Some libraries have begun to censor their book collection by removing ones they thought could be offensive. I believe there should not be any censorship in libraries. One reason I do not believe that there should be censorship in libraries is that tons of good books are lost because of it. Some libraries do not carry @PERSON1 books because he uses curse words. They should not remove the books completely; they should just warn people of the language. A second reason why I do not believe in censorship is that some books on different religions get removed. I once saw a librarian throw a book away simply because it was about the @CAPS1 religion. This was a horrible action because the @CAPS1 religion is an extremely interesting one, and now many people will never know anything about it. This limits access to diverse perspectives. A third reason is that they @MONTH1 end up offending some people by removing a book. I once heard of an @CAPS3 family complaining about a library because they removed a book about the @CAPS3 religion. I found this upsetting because everyone deserves to have access to the books that they want, regardless of the content. I propose that instead of censorship, the libraries separate the books by different subjects and genres then put up signs warning anyone that goes into that section. This way, everyone can get the books that they want to get. The libraries also would not have to worry about people being offended, preserving intellectual freedom for all. In conclusion, maintaining open access with appropriate warnings is the most equitable solution, ensuring that libraries remain a resource for everyone and that diverse perspectives are not suppressed through censorship.
1396	4373	2	3	Throughout time, fellow people have struggled to censor or ban material that they consider offensive. It can be the way they were brought up, or simply what they believe. I do not believe that it should be up to anyone to say what should and should not be censored for anyone but themselves. Everyone has one life, and in this one life we create our personal opinions and beliefs on what is wrong and what is right. We are completely unaware of many people throughout our life cycles, and saying what should be banned from everybody is almost claiming you know the morals, beliefs, and customs of everyone in the world. If I came to school one day and brought a book that contained material that I think is relevant and not just pure exploitation, then I should be able to read that as long as I don't influence others against their own will. Let's say another student sees me reading that same book and he has grown up in a household that taught him that the situations and material in my book are overly offensive, I do not think he should be able to create a ban of this book just because of his own upbringing. There is such a thing as mass agreement, but there is also a thing called mass ignorance, and to say that I know what should and should not be shown to other people is completely ignorant on my part. I think the only allowance of censorship should be from parent to child. That is the only situation that someone should be allowed authority over someone else, because they have undeniable duties as parents, and they should be able to say what is right, knowing they are creating a child to think what is wrong and what is right in their mind, and it is ultimately up to the individual to decide what they want to consume and believe.
1397	4374	2	3	At Jeffersonville High School, we don't have the right to remove a book from the shelf. If there's a book that's not for you, simply don't get it, like a bad movie. It's like getting a bad lunch; you're not going to get it. So, why get a bad book or a movie? It's a matter of personal choice and responsibility, and we should exercise that freedom by choosing materials that suit our individual interests and maturity levels.
1398	4375	2	3	Censorship is when a group of people agree that a certain book, song, movie, or magazine is found offensive in any way. Mainly parents and educators find these materials such as books offensive and do what they can to get this book taken out of libraries at schools. Censorship was originally started during the 'MIDDLE AGES' in EUROPE with the 'PRINTING PRESS'. It was used to hide information from the public by taking all records of it away from the public's use. In AMERICA, we are a democracy, but we still choose censorship to hide certain information from certain people. In some parents' opinions books are great and educational for children, but in other parents' opinions books do things like promote homosexuality, use false language, or even show drug use. Most of these books are not trying too promote these things but they are just part of the story. So pretend like we hide all the bad events or situations in the world from occuring infront of our children. They have no knowledge of this part of life, so what happens when they get in the real world and grow up? We can't just hide drugs from them, we can read these and teach them the harm drugs can do to someone and how to avoid them. If we send our children out into this world without any knowledge of drugs things will get out of control. Majority of these books that contain 'harmful' things to children, but they teach lessons that parents don't think of, they just think of what written down on the paper instead of the moral overall lesson that the story is bringing to a child. If a story has false language, our child will ask us what these words mean and we will tell them not to use them and what they mean so the child knows not to repeat them. If not, they can go into school and another child will tell your child to say these words and your child (not knowing the meaning of the word) will go out and say it and be awarded with a detention or even a suspension. Personally, I don't want my child receiving a detention or suspension. Censorship is a growing issue in the USA. It can do good things like hide actual sexual interactions from children, which should be hid from children anyways. Censorship can also do the bad things like I discussed earlier, which do more harm on a child then good. When your asked on your opinion on sensorship, just always remember what's best for your child, and knowledge is always better then clueless, encouraging a balanced approach that considers both protection and preparation for the realities of the world.
1399	4376	2	3	Going to the library is one of the best ways to explore new things. Some items are not appropriate for everyone though. Certain books, movies, magazines, and music should not be accessed by everyone. Having an adult only section would be a way to solve this problem. Removing certain materials from the library would not be in good interest. Any popular material should be available at the library. Many best selling books would be wrong for children to read, but they would be perfectly fine for adults. That doesn't mean these books need to be taken out of the library. Children should be restricted from viewing the explicit materials though. Having a section in the library from which only adults can rent the items, would remove this problem. People under @NUM1 should also be restrained from looking through these materials. Having a childrens' section in the libray would also keep them away from adult materials. The library needs to make itself user friendly. People who frequent the library often pick up a book, not knowing what it holds. When inappropriate material is inside a child might innocently read into or see something they are not supposed to. Parents should not have to worry about their kids seeing inappropriate pictures or text. They should feel safe letting their children look through all the books at the library. Library workers should also make sure the adult materials stay in the hands of adults. Allowing children and their parents to feel safe and welcome is an important part of the library. Taking adult materials out of the libray is not a good idea. It would lower its popularity. Everyone has different interests, and they want to research them at the library. The safety of children is also important. Making sure children cannot reach these materials is a concern. Having separate adult and children sections could solve this problem. Not allowing anyone under @NUM1 to check out explicit materials would also help. Keeping the libray full of information but still safe for children is the ideal situation. Therefore, by implementing adult sections and age restrictions, libraries can maintain their appeal while ensuring a safe environment for younger patrons.
1400	4377	2	3	I believe that not all books should be banned, but some books should. For example their are many good books that are banned because it may have a little bit of cussing in them but I believe that is ok, I mean it isn't like the child wouldn't hear the same words maybe even worse if he turned on his TV. But if a book talks about certain things it should be banned, such as hate against other races, or it talks negatively about someones religion. For example I read a very famous book called The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. This was a very good book but for some reason it was banned in my school library so I couldn't check it out. I had to go to the public library to get it. I don't understand what is so wrong with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn that it is banned by schools. This book may talk of a mischevious youngster who runs away, does alot of differnt crazy activites, and even smokes but this is no worst then what we are exposed too on TV. If I was a administrator in a school I would look at what is the meaning behind the book and what it is trying to express. For example if a book is offensive to some one for instance a book written by the Nazis, this piece shouldn't be aloud on the shelve. But if it is a book about the Jim Crow era and the South's view on slavery this would be ok. Because the Nazis book is more hate than anything it is for instance promoting the Nazis and that isnt right. But the book on the Jim Crow era and the South's view on slavery is a part of our history it shows differnt ways of thinking of the time that we don't really know if they were right or wrong it is just what they believed. So my point I am trying to express in this piece is that don't hate a book because maybe the language in it or the events in it may not be what you agree with but judge the book because of the message that it is trying to express. Hopefully you will agree with me in this. But if a book talks about certain things it should be banned, such as hate against other races, or it talks negatively about someones religion. I have expressed my opinion on this matter I hope you agree with me and can maybe convince the school that they need to take a second look at what kind of books we keep on our shelves and what kind of books we take off our shelves, ultimately ensuring a balanced collection that promotes both learning and respect.
1401	4378	2	3	Everywhere you go these days, you see violence in every store around the world. Children growing up in this world are our future, and they are exposed to that negative output. A lot of kids and young adults thrive off of the offensive materials the world puts out there.  I think that the offensive things should be taken off the shelves and sold in stores for adults that are twenty-one and older. If people sell offensive things in stores where it allows young teenagers to buy those products, then we are just putting ourselves at harm. I was just in a bookstore the other day, and I saw magazines that were not appropriate. I thought to myself, how could they sell these types of magazines? Music, movies, and magazines shouldn't even be sold in a bookstore; that's why it's called a bookstore.  It's not called a movie, music, or magazine store; they call it a bookstore for a reason. If students read books or listen to music that is offensive, they are going to grow up thinking it's okay to be that way or treat somebody differently because of who they are or what they represent. I'm not saying take all the books out of the store, just take the offensive ones and have a twenty-one-or-older sign, so the kids don't end up getting a hold of the book and learning something they shouldn't.  When I was young, I went to the bookstore all the time with my mom. I would just pick up any book there was and start trying to read. A lot of the time, my mom would take the book from me because it was offensive; I didn't know that at the time; I was just a little kid. In today's society, kids are growing up quicker than they really have to, and that's not a good thing. Kids should be able to be kids and read kid's books.  I guess it doesn't really matter for middle school and high school kids because those kids really don't like to read at all. The kids that we have to look out for are the ones in elementary because those kids actually want to learn how to read. And if we put a book about drugs on the shelf, those kids will read it, and those kids will learn about it and be curious as to what that drug has as an effect on you.  In the end, it doesn't really matter what I say because people are going to keep making books, any type of book. It is all based on how much money they can make. It doesn't matter if it is a negative or a positive book; the company wants to make money, and so does the author, which means that the accessibility of potentially harmful material will likely persist, despite concerns about its impact on young minds.
1402	4379	2	3	There are many different topics that could be offensive; it just depends on the person's own personal judgement. In my opinion, I do not believe that materials should be removed because not everyone has the same view or opinions. If someone comes from a different country or even a different religion, topics like abortion and racism are going to be viewed very differently. I think having a variety of topics will help expand different thoughts and make the readers of the material see things in a different way. When I am older and if one of my elementary children was to bring home a book over abortion, I would be concerned. Honestly though, I do not believe schools would let inappropriate topics for younger children read books like that. High school is a little bit different with a junior or senior student though. Their maturity level is going to be mature enough to handle the material and I do not think high school is right for schools to remove something that could actually help someone. In the book, 'A Child Called It', there is a lot of detailed events that happen. Some might say abuse is too graphic for children but the reality of abuse is, events like those happen in today's society. It really opened up my eyes and I am extremely happy I read it. The realization actually made me want to help those children who grow up in homes like the one described in the book. I believe it had the same effect on other people too and some children might even grow up to help others in that horrible situation. Libraries should be able to have a variety of different books. I am not saying however that they should have books on murder and saying abuse is alright but books that will help expand the children's minds. Abuse could even change their lives. Some books are a sensitive topic but who has the right to tell someone something they should believe? It would mean more to someone if they found their own way and beliefs then having people tell them what they should and should not do or believe in. I have also read a book recently titled, 'Unwind'; it is about the government granting the ability to unwind your children and then the body parts will go to those in need. It is sort of cruel in one way but the topic the author is trying to get across is not. A quote from the book is, 'On one side you have people killing abortion doctors for the right of life and on the other you have people getting pregnant just to sell their fetal tissue'. It states that everywhere you go people are going to disagree and agree on things but not everyone will believe in the same thing. It shows that just because one person thinks one way is right does not mean another will. The book changed my perspective on many different topics and helped me open my eyes on different views. Racism, abortion, child abuse, unwinding your children, what ever the case may be, some people will support it and some will not. I think it is time for children around the world to discover for themselves what they truly believe in and taking 'offensive' material from the school libraries is not going to help any. My opinion on this topic is strongly advising to leave the material alone because for there to be a book about it, the author had to have had a reason to write it and honestly, what is better for the future then a generation of children grounded to their own true beliefs?
1403	4380	2	3	Since the beginning there has always been someone who is offended by certain media. Books, movies, and music have been the main focus of the subject of this controversy. There have been arguments over it so severe that it has went to court! The people that have been upset over media have caused there to be certain censorships over these materials. I believe that there should not be censorship in media. I think that there are books, movies, and other media materials that can be found offensive to someone or a group of people. This is why they should have labels or at least a description on the back of these products that explain what could cause someone to become upset by it. If something is considered too vulgar for the public eye then they should have it somewhere more discret, but not be taken off the shelves. I disagree that media materials should be taken of shelves for being offensive. Media is all about someones free expression and trying to share it with the world. There are around 8 billion people in the world and at least one of them is bound to enjoy the same type of media you do. A great example of a media material that is challenged every day in every part of the world is a book called the bible. The bible is considered to be one of the oldest books in the world and is still in print. People of different religions can sometimes find the print of bibles over there religious books offensive and there is always great controversy about it. All these movies and books though are great because they are different and free! The world needs people who challenge ideas and religions. Every single person in the world is unique and I think it is great for everyone to put their opinions out for others to find so they can have a new view on the subject or at least contemplate it. Society has already put parental advisory warnings on cds, put ratings on movies, and labeled books as challenged. All this does is restrict the public from finding new ideas to compare to and form opinions. I believe in freedom of thinking because it is the most valuable resource that we have, it is what sets us apart from each other. Let media be free so men, women, and children from all over the globe can be unique and wonderful! Censorship will be challenged in years to come and I will help challenge it for all to be free and happy. Therefore, it is important to continue advocating for free expression in media and to resist attempts to stifle creativity and diverse viewpoints.
1404	4381	2	3	Books, music, movies, and magazines that are in libraries should be appropriate material. But in some cases it's fine to have some offensive literature because people can learn from it. There needs to be an age limit to checking these items out. So I do believe we should keep offensive literature on the shelf. There needs to be a certain extent to what we leave on the shelves. Books, books, and more books, there are so many books and many other kinds of literature in libraries today. Libraries are a place of silence, and to some people that's boring. So like me when I go into a library I go to the books, or magazines that seem very interesting to me. Although they might seem interesting to me, others might find them offensive. Like it might be a comic book that may say something that someone may take offense to.  Libraries can't please everyone that walks through the doors. Just because someone does not like the offensive stuff that's in there doesn't mean they have to take it out, because there might be someone like me that likes those kind of books, or magazines. There are offensive stuff all over the world so you can't avoid it everywhere you go. I believe there is a good outcome for keeping offensive literature material on the shelves.  I think that keeping offensive material in libraries might have a good cause to it for one very good reason, learning. Like I said before it might be offensive to some people but to some it's not. So some people might like to learn about offensive things. Maybe they never knew those things that are in those books. They might also never know what's in those books unless they keep them on the shelves. They need to have a section where offensive books, magazines, music and movies go. If something is offensive put it on the shelf, and they must be 18 years old to check it out if it's on that shelf.  Yeah there might be a downfall to keeping offensive things in libraries, but you can't hide from it all your life. So instead of going out into the world and learning about it the hard way go to the library. You could pick a book up learn about it and how to deal with it. It's just part of life there is offensive material everywhere. You can't be sheltered your whole life.  So in my greatest opinion I do believe that we should keep these offensive material in libraries, it could be a learning experience. By keeping this material available with appropriate age restrictions, libraries can provide valuable opportunities for learning and understanding different perspectives.
1405	4382	2	3	I am not in agreement because young children should not be exposed to certain offensive books. However, I believe that books should not be removed or censored in the libraries because separating or washing away some potentially problematic things will ultimately be a bad idea. The act of removing books could lead to a slippery slope, where increasingly more materials are deemed unsuitable based on subjective criteria, thus limiting access to diverse perspectives and hindering intellectual freedom; therefore, open access to books, even those considered offensive by some, is vital for a library to fulfill its role as a center of learning and information.
1406	4383	2	3	I think that the censorship in libraries should definitely be relevant. Such as, I think that if someone wants to check out an adult book, they should be required to show ID at the desk. Many children take advantage of this; they rent books and games they know parents would never allow. A censorship system should be quite a simple arrangement for the public library systems. Private libraries can do as they choose; they are not under any state law. On the other hand, public libraries are under state and city law; they should not be able to show adult things to children. For example, in many libraries around the U.S., there are books called manga or anime books; a lot of them show partial nudity and other graphic things not suitable for younger children but are only rated 13+. I think there could be many changes in the library systems; it is your choice if you want to change them or not, and implementing some age verification for certain materials could be a beneficial step.
1407	4384	2	3	I do not believe that materials in libraries should be censored. If parents don't want their children reading or listening to inappropriate things, they should pay more attention to what they are doing. If parents monitor their children closer they will be able to control what they are doing. There are a lot of bad things for children to read, look at, and listen to out there. Parents need to do a better job teaching their children about what they can and should look at, read, or listen to.  It isn't often when you go to the library that you find something inappropriate unless you are looking for something inappropriate. It is very easy to tell what is good and what is bad. Most of the time in a library the more profound books and magazines are separated from the children's books. This, to me, is the way it should be in all libraries. In all of the times I have been to a library I have never accidentally come across something inappropriate. A library is a place for people of all ages it should not be limited to just one age group. Libraries serve a vital role in providing access to information and diverse perspectives for everyone.  If libraries were censored more people would be upset. It would be the same way if a store stopped selling your favorite product because one person did not like it. A lot of adults probably would not go if the library were censored. The library would then become a place for mostly children. Most small children do not even go to the library so they would become virtually useless. Libraries are valuable community resources that should cater to a wide range of interests and informational needs.  In all of my years I have never once heard of someone being deeply offended by something at a library. Whether it be in a magazine, on the news, or by word of mouth, I have never seen a complaint. Most parents do a good job of monitoring what their children look at or read. Those parents should not be deprived of their privileges to look at more adult rated things if they choose. Just because one parent was too irresponsible to monitor their child does not mean that all of the parents should be punished.  The library is a place for people of all ages. Therefore, the library should keep material for people of all ages and not just for children. The bottom line is that if people do not want their kids looking at inappropriate things they should keep a better watch over them. They should also teach them the difference in what is acceptable and what is not acceptable, ensuring that libraries remain inclusive and accessible to all members of the community.
1408	4385	2	3	Censoring books in libraries because a certain group of people doesn't like them, and finds them offensive is simply not fair. A good library is diverse and has something that everyone of different backgrounds can enjoy. A compromise wouldn't be as difficult as some people might actually think. Simply regulating books, and other products, by creating age limits based on the books content and maturity level would be an excellent alternative to actually censoring the books themselves. Take an author like @PERSON1 for example. His books contain subject matter and offensive crude language that would obviously not be deemed acceptable for most younger people. That being said censoring the books language wouldn't help in the slightest. If a younger person has the mental capability to read a book like @PERSON1 then they would have no problem making inferences on what matierial was said, and the ideas in the writing are going to be realized. The other fact is that taking out mature level books completley from the libraries is not a possible solution either. If you take out the diversity in your product your going to lose the diversity in your customer's as well. For instance think about a movie store. If the only movies sold were @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 there would be a lot less people wanting to go to that store, because then it just turns into a child's store. Even censoring the movies would not be effective because your taking away the art of having an unfiltered movie. So my simple solution is obvious. Movies have ratings based on maturity content, so why shouldn't books. Books that deal with more controversal content shouldn't be placed in the shelves next to young readers' books, and they should have a label indicating that the specific book @MONTH1 contain material not suitable for a person under a specific age. People trying to censor entertainment and look into the best interest of their loved ones is perfectly fine, but you cant blindfold them forever. We're all on the same planet and we all reach the age of realization of reality; therefore, age-based labeling offers a balanced approach that respects both artistic expression and parental guidance.
1409	4386	2	3	I believe that if you let people take stuff off of the shelves that they didn't like then there would be nothing left. I thank this because there are a lot of parents that don't want their little kids to be seeing it or hearing it. That is because they could get infulenced to do the wrong thang and get themselves in truble for it. Then you have some parents that don't care what their kids are doing as long as they are leving them alone. Then you have some other that are very over procted. Yes, I think that there are something that should be taken off shelves because they are very interpreit. They are because they are talking a drugs and alchole and trying to get young kids to try it and get addicated to it. That why they can get more money from it and those kids end up geting heard or died from it. All some of thies bussinesses are trying to do is get money from the young because they make to bottles or cantaners look cool. Most of the time you will have kids go for it but there are some kids that don't because they don't want to get in truble or heart themsleves. There are some songs that should not be alowed to be played because of some of the stuff that they say. There are some people and some parents that listen to it and with there kids in the car then their kid will go to school and be sing it and get in truble for it. I think that their are a lot of thang that should be different but they are not because the bussinesses are just happy that they are geting money. They don't care how is buying it as long as they get there money for it and that is not the wright way to look at it you should care about the lives of people and their familys. Then you have some magazines that have some uniperate pitchers in them. They do because they are trying to get guys to buy them just for that one pitcher that is in it. They want it because its a very pritty girl with just a bathing suite on or maybe nothing on. That is why they put it in there so they can get their money off of it. Most of the girls that are in them are modles and they are very pritty, but sometime there will be a little boy that takes his dad and then he takes it to school and get in truble for it. Then his partens are enbeist because they didn't know that he had. The parents would be embarrassed and have to deal with the consequences of their child's actions. That is why I thank that some stuff should be not on the shelves in stores. You will have partens that get it tten leave it laying out and their kids will get in then might take it to school. You should never leave anything that you don't want your kids to have laying out for them to get. That is why I believe that and what I thank about it, because ultimately it is about protecting children and ensuring they are not exposed to harmful influences that could negatively impact their development and well-being.
1410	4387	2	3	I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that could be offensive should not be pulled off the shelves. People have different tastes, and companies would lose money if diverse options weren't available, potentially leading to business failures and limiting consumer choice. If your favorite candy was removed because it offended someone, you'd be upset, and that's how others feel when their preferred media is taken away. What would replace these items? Filling shelves with more candy, for instance, isn't necessarily a better alternative. If you find something offensive, simply ignore it; others enjoy it, just as you enjoy your favorite candy, and there are plenty of other options to choose from, so we should allow people the freedom to choose what they want to consume.
1411	4388	2	3	A curious child goes into the library for the first time to find a story to read. Yet, when she goes to the children's section, the book she wants is not allowed in this library because it is said to promote certain ideals to children. The child goes to her older sister for help to find a different book. The older sister is too busy looking for her own book. She had walked into the library looking to find answers to her questions over a liberal topic. She can't find the book she wants, the library has censored it. Why would we censor libraries if we have the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech? It is not right to censor libraries because that is restricting what is allowed to be read, which is taking away part of our freedom. The press is allowed to print anything, and we the people read it. Will that be the next thing that is censored? A book is just like the newspaper, it is relaying a story to entertain the audience that is reading it.  By censoring libraries that is taking away the freedom of speech. Writing is a way to express yourself. Authors share their expressions through writing, hoping they can touch someone else's life and be of some assistance, helping its reader to escape a horrendous day or to answer the questions of a curious teenager. I use books daily to escape the stresses of life, the 'Harry Potter' series gave me something to do and allowed me to use my imagination and mind, I could escape into another world and leave my chores behind me.  Some people say that offensive things should be censored. In our culture the slightest thing can called 'offensive' now. If we never learn about these 'offensive' things how would we understand history? There will always be rude things that have been said, but we should be exposed to them so we can learn from it. By censoring these items we will never learn and neither will our children about other cultures, history, or liberal ideas.  Instead of censoring items, there is another solution. Make certain items restricted and red flagged. If certain items become restricted; it would mean that people over a certain age are allowed to read them. By doing this a child's mind would not be polluted, but we could still be exposed to different ideas and learn from them. If there was a system to red flag an item, this would allow the reader to know that this item contains what could be considered offensive material so they do not have to expose themselves to it if they did not want to, but others could. This would work because the books could stay in the library and still be used, but there would be a warning system for those who do not want to be around it or allow their children to be around it.  In conclusion censoring libraries is a bad idea. It takes away our freedom of the press and speech. We are also making ourselves ignorant this way. If we put out a warning system it is fair to everyone, allowing the 'offensive' material to stay in the libraries while ensuring people know ahead of time what they and their children are being exposed to, fostering a more informed and understanding community.
1412	4389	2	3	I think that no source of knowledge should be taken off any shelf in any library because a few people think it's offensive. In my own personal opinion, someone could find a book offensive and another person could think it is reasonable. People can't make the judgment to say this is offensive to me so therefore it's offensive to everyone who reads it. Some of the best books on our shelves are the ones that *might* be offensive. Some books are racist; *The Adventures* of Huckleberry Finn and *To Kill a Mockingbird* for example, has some racist and sexist comments and remarks. If everyone got mad about that then a very good book wouldn't be read by the people who are going to run the country when I'm older. I know that all the older books would be gone too, and then no one would know about what happened in the 1960's. Also, some of the television shows people watch are ten times worse than the books people read, if you find a book offensive don't read it! When I hear about a book being offensive it makes me want to read it. It gives the book character and makes it humorous. We can't just have the same old books talking about the same old things because that gets boring after a while. Sometimes from those books you even learn something about yourself that makes you wonder if I didn't read this book would I still have found this out. Sometimes it brings out the best in people and that's the best part about reading a book like that. Libraries are a place to go and look at all the books you could ever think of reading and no one should be able to take that away from people. I want my kids to be able to have the same options that I had growing up plus all the new books coming out. If you ask me it's just not right to take away someone else's choice of knowledge; this type of censorship limits understanding and open-mindedness. That's my personal opinion on taking books off the shelves of public libraries.
1413	4390	2	3	I believe that things shouldn't be taken off the shelves because a few people are offended. There will be a few that don't like something but for every few that don't like it there are some who do. For example there might be a book that makes females look dumb but personally it doesn't affect me, but there are some girls who get offended because of their superior knowledge. I have a friend who gets offended by movies where the black guy always gets in trouble or dies first. So if we removed every movie that offended him what would be left? I feel offended when a magazine shows girls are pretty because it makes people feel insecure about themselves. Even though I feel offended I'm not going to request them to remove it because there are some magazines that give tips and actually help people feel better about themselves, and if I took that away from them it could cause issues. If there is something that is removed from shelves it should have a good reason. Like if there was a magazine that showed nudity I would understand them removing it so a kid doesn't see it. Some libraries remove things that could potentially cause a great issue. Maybe a newspaper talks about a great disaster and everyone swarms the stand attacking each other. Something like that can cause people to be hospitalized and then the library will be sued. Yes I agree that there are some people who would request the stuff to be removed but you can't always get your way. I know people would say that's not fair but there is a saying that says 'life isn't fair' and that's true. So next time you hear someone wanting something removed tell them this, or next time you want something removed you refer back to this. So in conclusion things shouldn't be removed unless necessary, such as protecting children or preventing violence. So when someone is offended that's their problem; you can always walk away, you don't have to look or listen, which avoids restricting the choices and experiences of others.
1414	4391	2	3	I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are here for a reason. People like them. Maybe there are some books and things that people might not find offensive. That's ok; I'm not trying to say it isn't, but you don't have to look at that book. There are so many others to pick from; it doesn't have to be the first one you pick up. The objects we are talking about are our entertainment; it brings us joy and many smiles. People need to understand that children are going to have to get their education not only from their teachers, but through these tools. Tools is a better word for these things; it makes them have a meaning. Children nowadays love books, music, movies, magazines, etc. As a teenager, I can say that most of us who like music, we love it. It builds our character. People don't make books and magazines just for them to sit on a shelf and gather dust. They were meant to be picked up and looked at. I also have to say that some people make a big deal about a subject like this. Don't get me wrong, I can understand where their opinion stands, but that doesn't mean I have to agree. Children, ADULTS, and TEENAGERS all have to learn in one way or another. Some of these ways are what some people are trying to get removed from our libraries and other places as well. If people want this, it's going to be a big war, only because they are not the only people on the planet. If people want these tools of ours to be removed, this will only be the beginning. In the next couple of years, people will want to get rid of something else, then something else. It's just one right after another; it won't stop. This just shows how our communities agree and disagree with each other. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion; some are good, and some are bad. In this case, my opinion is that I totally and completely disagree with getting rid of the tools that can improve our world as we know it to be, and we should embrace these resources instead of limiting access to them.
1415	4392	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? No. I strongly disagree. You know that there is more than one radio station? Well, you do. Not just one person should be able to talk for everyone. I enjoy every genre of music and books. That's pretty much my life. All I know is that when I get offended by a song, I change it. When I'm reading a book I don't like, I put it down. It's not your job to make my decisions. I live my own life and personally think you should live yours as well. Books, movies, plays, games, magazines, all things of that sort are for our entertainment. If they began taking them off shelves because of vulgar things and things that offend people, then why do we have freedom of speech? Those people that are offended need to put whatever it is down and move on. Just because a handful of people are offended by the everyday things that people use to stay amused, doesn't mean they need to be taken away. Authors and directors spend months, even years making movies and writing books just to entertain us and feel accomplished. If they started taking them off our shelves and off the big screens, people would lose jobs. For example look at the Shakespeare plays. That can easily offend a person, but those are brilliant pieces of work. I am personally the kind of person that reads books that are suspenseful, books that keep me on the edge of my seat. People enjoy books that they can relate to, and some people can relate to those books that are 'offensive.' I, myself, have read a book that cinsisted of drugs and viloence that I related to and it helped me out, it made me realize its not always the right thing to do. I think people need to realize that all those books, movies, magazines, and all the aboe that 'offend' them, are reality. No matter where you go, what you do, what you throw out, or what you keep in the house, your kids, parenst, friends, everyone will see it sometime in theirlives. Viloence and drugs are seen everyday. Many more things that offend people are always going to be there. If all of those things are offensive to some people, then they need a reality check. Books like that can influence kids to wanna go the rightdirection. They read a book or see a movie with a drug addict in prison and theyll think, 'Wow, I'm never going there.' I can't say that goes for all kids in this world, but you get the jist of what I'm trying to say. If it's the parents that are worried about their kids getting into that kind of stuff, be my guest to remove it from your household, but not from everyone, not from the people who enjoy it. I'm a strong believer that people know right from wrong, so why not just grow up a little bit and do what's right? Those books, movies, and magazines that are offensive, are enjoyable to me. This makes me think of drama. People say they hate it, but no matter what, it's everywhere, and it will always be everywhere. If you can't get through life being offended every now and then, then how do you think you'll survuve. What do you think is in store for the next years to come? You must learn to deal with it. Taking away all of these things, I think, is a mistake. If people are against it, they need to worry about themselves and just leave it alone. They can make their own decisions, they don't have to pick up and read a Stephen King book when there is a Nicholas Sparks in their reach. That is what literature is about, writing. Do you honeslty think the author was worried about offending anyone? No, because the author or director whom wrote the book or made the movie, they knew what is was about and they know that not all of the world will see it. Not all of the world will care to see it. They know that people are smart enough to read the summary before they get'offended.' It irritates me when people think they need to live for everyone. It's like the saying, 'One man's trash is another man's treasure.' You might not like it, you might even hate it. But once it's out of your hands, the next person might come back and drastically fall in love with it. I think that just because someone picks up a book and it offends them, it doesn't mean they needed to whiped off the shelves. Grow up, put whatever it is that offends you down, and walk away, as censorship is not the
1416	4393	2	3	In this world you never know what someone might be writing. There are many materials in this world that I think aren't appropriate for someone to be reading, watching, or listening to, etc. You @MONTH1 may be thinking that anyone makes his/her own decision of what they read, watch, and listen to. Well, I do agree with that, but I also believe that some materials aren't rated properly for age. I do think that some materials should be banned from people under age, some from kids, and some from everyone.  You @MONTH1 may be thinking that all of this is wrong and that there is nothing wrong with books, music, movies, etc., but in my opinion, some materials are just offensive and not proper. I have seen so many materials that I think are not proper for people under age to be looking at. In some movies, for example, the rating is just not right because some movies have so much violence or language. You might not think it's that big of a deal, of course, but I do. In my opinion, some materials are rated too low and should not be for people under age.  It's not surprising to me that kids are now yelling, hitting, and/or acting like rebels to their parents. Many of these things kids get from books, music, movies, etc. This is one of the many reasons some materials should be banned from kids. You ask yourself why? Well, first of all, kids are just learning and they do everything they watch, see, or listen to. I mean, now kids don't even think about what they're about to do. They just do it, they don't care, they think it's okay. I think that parents should be alert to offensive materials on the shelves, and should say something about it so they are banned.  Why ban some materials from everyone? Well, first of all, why do we even want to watch, see, or listen to things that are not right? You @MONTH1 may be thinking that we just do it for fun and that it's enjoyable and there is nothing wrong with it. Well, you @MONTH1 may be right but also wrong. I certainly do agree with you, we all watch things for fun and to enjoy them, but some things are just too out of this world for us. Why do people do crazy things now in these days? In my opinion, I think it is because they mostly get it from books, music, movies, etc. I think that if a book shows very offensive things they should be banned from everyone no matter what. It's the right thing to do.  If you don't want to see this world get more out of control than it already is, well, we need to do something about all these materials that are offensive and ban them for good. We certainly don't want to see our kids yelling, hitting, or acting like rebels to us. We don't want some crazy person coming to our house and doing crazy things to us just because that's what they learned from those materials they had on the shelves. It has become clear to me that some materials should be banned from people under age, from kids, and some from everyone, to safeguard our society and future generations.
1417	4394	2	3	A place filled with knowledge should be a place where you can find all the news that is making the world what it is today, a person should be able to find out things from the past also. A library has many different things found in it: books, magazines, movies, and some have music. The books range from encyclopedia's to novels by @PERSON1, the variety of books and information is to the extreme. But then again with all the good things there always comes a bad side of the information. With all the profanity found in today's society you would not want a child seeing or hearing any of it while at a public library. Books are put into a library so that people have the chance to read them and become more knowledgeable. The thought of a younger person going into the older, adult area is very upsetting but then again who's to say that that individual is not allowed to read an article or magazine that has more mature types of information or language found in them. I feel that a person will see what they want to see and what they want to read, fact of the matter is they have the right to. Both, young and older people need to be educated in the world's past history and the present news. One reason being to prevent things that happened in the past, happening again. Another reason is just so that they know what is going on around them and so that the individual is informed. Libraries should have banners or flaps up saying what is in a certain section of that specific area and people can make the decision to go over to those areas or not. Things that are found 'not right' in one's eyes @MONTH1 might not seem so bad to another's, it's all in personal preference. Things should still be out for the public to read or see because limiting access restricts the pursuit of understanding. Making the choice to go into a library is an individual's decision. Fact is that the library is a place where a person should be able to get knowledge, no matter what type of information. A person should be able to get their information without the censorship of others, allowing each individual to expand their understanding of the world according to their own needs and interests.
1418	4395	2	3	I think that your parents should have to sign a piece of paper saying that it is ok or its not ok for the person to go to that side of the library. It is up to the parents and the way their kids will handle it. On one side of the library it would be more geared to a more mature audience, no pornographic material of course, but stuff that wouldn't be considered PG. Kids fifteen and older would understand. They might also have to have an adult with them. On the other side of the library it would be more of a children's area with child stories. It would be targeted for more kids that are fourteen years and younger would like. There would have to be someone in the dividing line being shown the pass that says its ok or not. It would be a little difficult but it would satisfy both parties. It is up to the parent to decide if it is ok for their children to read a certain content of language and description. The child must be at least 13 in order to get a pass from the parent though. I definitely agree with Katherine Paterson, eventually your kids will find out what all those things are. I would rather have my kids learn from a book and ask me then find it out on the streets where they could end up getting hurt or in trouble with the law, or even going to a party and end up doing something that might kill them. Ultimately, this system would empower parents to guide their children's reading experiences and provide a safer environment for exploration.
1419	4396	2	3	Do your rights end where mine begin? In such a diverse society, clashing opinions are unavoidable. Does that mean another human's rights should be abused because we don't agree with their practices, beliefs, or lifestyle? Everyone in this world is entitled to their own opinion. What is wrong to some people might be right to others. For example, one family might view their children using curse words as offensive while another might see no problem. Diversity in beliefs does not mean that it is acceptable to censor society from cursing, religion, or violence discussed in published works. These concepts exist in the world and censoring them will not make them disappear. It is understood that there is both bad and good in the world, and pulling materials from the shelves of libraries will not change that. Censoring books, magazines, music, and other media is denying someone the ability to see ideas from all points of view. Whether or not you prevent a young child from seeing all perspectives does not mean the bad and good do not exist. The saying 'one year older, one year wiser' can refer to the acknowledgement of different ideas and opinions. As a child grows, he will learn more about the materials that were censored. In some cases, such as in the classroom, your rights do end where mine begin. When it comes to learning about the beauty of diversity, everyone is able to choose what they pick from the shelf. The definition of 'offensive material' is simply a matter of opinion, highlighting the subjective nature of censorship and emphasizing the importance of individual choice in accessing diverse perspectives.
1420	4397	2	3	No, I do not think that certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves. Why? Because nowadays kids read things such as gang violence and things that don't involve school material, but some kids find the books that they read interesting. Now, do I think that the books should not be given to students who are very young of age? Yes, due to the fact that some books are a little above others' age of reading. Sometimes you @MONTH1 have kids who are interested in what others don't read. Books such as gang violence and drug abuse are some of those books in categories of which some can't read. I think that in this case kids under a certain age shouldn't read these books because of some of the content that is involved in it. Kids find these books, movies, and magazines interesting because many things that happen in the world today happen inside those books. I'm not saying that it's a good thing, but I'm saying that the things they read and see in those books and movies are things that some of us have seen in an everyday life. When I was younger, I went to a library in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, and whenever a kid would choose a book that wasn't for him/her, they would always say 'you need your parents' permission to check this book or magazine, etc., out'. Once I actually noticed and got the point of why they would do this, I thought that it was a good idea. I figure that all libraries should be like this considering that kids shouldn't read books that aren't for them. This is also a good way to get kids from reading things that are not age-appropriate to finding something that is. So the main answer to this suggestion is, no, I don't think that these materials should be moved from shelves out of libraries because once they are gone, then some kids might not even attend the library anymore because the books that they find interesting are gone. So my suggestion is to not move them and let them stay on shelves just as any other book would, but to implement parental permission for certain age groups to ensure age-appropriate reading.
1421	4398	2	3	Do you believe that certain books, movies, or magazines should be taken off the shelf in a library due to censorship? There are many times when you hear a parent tell their child not to look at that magazine because they don't want them to see the vulgar things on the inside. I've heard parents tell their children not to ever watch that movie because it'll show things that they don't need to be seeing. Almost every day we're put in situations like these, not knowing whether we should pick up the magazine or just leave it on the shelf. In my opinion, I believe that libraries should remove anything vulgar from the shelves. Kids are encouraged to go to the library as much as possible, but not if there is vulgar things on the shelves. Kids are told many times a week by their parents, teachers, and other adults to go the library. They can work on their homework, read a book, or do some studying for school. When they get distracted from finding the book they want with a book that has vulgar things in it, they're going to be curious. The main reason I disagree with having vulgar things on the shelves is because of young children. The last thing they need to be looking at is something that isn't appropriate for their age. It's hard for a child to turn down a movie or magazine they've never seen or looked at before.  In most libraries the adult section is seperated from the childrens section. This doesn't mean that a child can't over hear something that the adults are listening to or watching. The childrens section is made for fairytale stories and kid movies, but when the adult section has things going on over there that aren't the most appropriate then kids can over hear. If children and adults are going to be in the same library then I think they should make it completely impossible for children to veer over there and see what's new on that side of the library. Some libraries have computers near both sections.  Another reason I think libraries should censor themselves more is because of teenages in the community. After school hours, a lot of teenagers in our community enjoy going to the library. If this is such a good environment for teenagers to be then why are they able to download bad music off of the internet?  Some teenagers listen to bad music with cursing, vulgar language, and much more. Libraries should make it impossible for teenagers to do this. If they want to download bad music then they need to do it somewhere else where youngers can't get ahold of any of it. Libraries could install filters or monitoring software.  My last argument for this is a heads up for the parents. Parents should check out what stuff their kids are looking at when they go to the library. You might not think your child would look at something with vulgar things, but sometimes, they're curious. All children are and it's human nature to be curious. I, myself, would go with my child a few times just to see what's in the library and tell them not to take things off the shelves that look bad. Parents can also talk to librarians.  Some libraries can't completely fix everything. They can't take every bad or vulgar thing off of the shelves. In the quote it says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.', I can think of books and magazines that I would never want any child to look at, especially at a young age. Libraries need to be more interested in taking vulgar things off the shelves so that younger children cannot get ahold of them, ensuring a safer and more appropriate environment for learning and exploration.
1422	4399	2	3	Some believe certain books are inappropriate for children, yet some libraries seemingly prioritize reading above all else. They don't always seem to worry if a young child picks up a book filled with profanity. Despite designated children's sections, kids can easily access books containing adult language. I remember easily finding books with curse words as a child frequenting the library. We even found it amusing and would repeat the words. In school, teachers even read books with curse words, leading to laughter, though repeating those words outside of reading resulted in disciplinary action. We rationalized it as acceptable due to its presence in books. I agree that books with mature language should be restricted from young children's access. While appropriate for junior high, elementary school is too young; such books are intended for adults, as some stories are enhanced by strong language. My parents disapproved of the profanity-laden books I brought home, but they never complained to the library, acknowledging my eventual exposure to such language. Therefore, access to books containing curse words should be restricted for young children because of their impressionable nature.
1423	4400	2	3	Billions of books float from shelf to shelf each day: fictional and nonfictional, horror and comedy. Writers reside in every part of the world composing works from complex life experiences to simple dreams. Being an author, who has the right to freedom of speech, story plots become to have endless combinations. Every reader seeks out a different style. Libraries contain books that tower to the ceilings, any kind, every kind. Books are divided into their individual sections according to truth, kind and cover, each category holding about four options. The necessity for censorship should never be an option. Writers compose for all sorts of people. For some to say what's 'right' or 'wrong' is not a legitimate reason for a piece of work to be removed from a shelf. If, perhaps, more books had ratings such as movies do, an age-appropriate cubicle could be created instead of allowing young people to have access to such vulgarity. Taking away the enjoyment for some readers, however, is unethical. Whether pertaining to books, music, magazines, etc., censorship is unnecessary. Those who compose the entertainment should not have to worry about the content of their expression and/or interpretation. If the worry is concerning youth, parental guidance should be in effect. Resulting in cancellation can affect those who relate to the source, so it's important to consider all options. Therefore, it is important to respect individual preferences and protect artistic expression. To each, its own.
1424	4401	2	3	Censorship, or the ability to control what is seen or heard, is a term that is taken very differently from one person to the next. Music, if it is found offensive or inappropriate, can be consored or even banned from listening. Some magazines that are found at grocery stores, libraries, and sometimes even airports, have **opaque** @ORGANIZATION1 covers on the front to visually censor the front page of the magazine. Movies are given ratings based on their level of explicit material, and when shown on basic cable, they sometimes can have either silenced words, or more appropriate words brought in to fit the dialougue in the movie. Books, although very rarely, have been banned from libraries and censored from the entire world. Some books have been previously censored, but became uncensored and brought back to libraries. In my opinion, censorship should not be based on a single person's view of the material, but rather on the viewpoint of the public. Growing up, my parents would watch carefully about what shows I watched, what music I listened to, or the types of magazines that i looked at. When I was growing up, I loved to watch professional wrestling. I loved to watch big scary guys as tall as seven feet hitting each other with steel chairs, crashing each other into tables, or throwing each other off of twenty-foot steel cages. My brother and I used to have a favorite wrestler that we would for every week, @PERSON1 @CAPS1 could freighten any other wrestler who stood in his way. My brother and I loved to watch @PERSON1 @CAPS1 compete every week for a chance at a world chamionship belt. As time passed, professional wrestling began to welcome in beautiful women into their business. These women would come out onto the ring with tight, shiny, lingerie on as they became eye-candy for the men who watched professional wrestling. One day, I'm watching two girls fighting in a match when my mom walks in. She takes one look at the half-naked girls fighting each other and turns off the @CAPS3 and declares that professional wrestling is too adult for me. Even though I was twelve at the time, I didn't want to get in an argument with my mom about how much I should be allowed to see. Censorship can be based on the ideas and viewpoints of the parents and guardians. I was in grade school when I fell in love with the show, '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6.' @CAPS7 is a show about four boys who go on unintentional adventures to save their @CAPS4 @CAPS5. These four boys, who are all around eleven years old, use curse words that some adults would be afraid to use in every day life. Their behavior is very controversial and the show itself has been forced to ban a few of their episodes for safety reasons. One problem with @CAPS7 show was that my dad loved @CAPS7 show as well, and tried to get my mom to like the show. When my mom saw the show, she immediately banned me from watching it because of its explicit content. Now that I am older, I am able to make my own decisions about what I watch, but as a kid, my parents decided what was appropriate for me. I grew up listening to several different types of music. My brother listened to rap, alternative, and even songs that were in musicals because he was in show choir. My dad introduced me to classic rock, and my mom loved soft rock. Although I didn't necessarily like the music that my mom liked, I learned to love my dad's music and my brother's music. I loved to listen to music from artists like @ORGANIZATION4, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS8, @CAPS9, and so on. My musical tastes branched out into a variety of different genres. One day, I'm walking in the hallway when I hear some music coming from the living room. I go to see what is playing because it sounds unfamiliar. My dad and my brother told me to go into another room and not listen to the music. The song was by a band named @ORGANIZATION2. Even though it might seem unfair, censorship, given by the parents and guardians, is very necessary. Although some people might find a certain piece of material offensive, it doesn't mean that the entire world should be banned from the material itself. If that person wants to keep away from the material and keep their kids from seeing or listening to that material, they are able to do that. Censorship, given by the parents or guardians, is the best way to view censorship. Nothing should be banned from a library, music store, or any other place that sells these materials. Censorship is important, but the entire banning of a certain piece of
1425	4402	2	3	Yes, there are many things today that have censorship, but should we keep them out of our libraries? I think not. They should not take items out of the libraries due to censorship. Maybe if they are such a big concern, they could do something else with them besides taking them out entirely.  I don't believe that they should take out censored items from the libraries just because some people have a problem with it, because nowadays you can go out in public and hear the same stuff they put in those censored movies, games, songs, etc. I think that if they are even thinking about taking censored products out of the library, it should be up to the library and not the government.  If censorship is such a big problem with people, they don't have to check it out or look at it. So maybe if they are having problems with parents because their kids are checking the censored items out, they should have a ban. Like if you want to check out an item with censorship, you either have to be 18 or have a parent or guardian with you. But if it is still a problem with it, make it like tobacco products where you have to be 18.  Then, if the libraries don't want to do that, they could make a whole room just for censored items. They should also put the room in a corner or in a less populated area of the library. There should also have to have a sign saying there are censorship items in that room and, maybe, a sign saying 18 and older.  So, there are many other ways to deal with censored items. Since there are so many ways to deal with them, why take them out? We should not have to take censorship items out just because some people do not like it, because we shouldn't punish everyone because of a few people.
1426	4403	2	3	If a woman walked into a library and started throwing a tantrum about how inappropriate a book was, and she wanted it removed from the shelves, I wouldn't just stare and wonder if she was crazy. I would acknowledge that this is a public place, and everyone has their own opinions, but also firmly believe that even if someone thinks a material in a library is inappropriate, the material should not be taken off the shelves. Many people actually believe materials in a library are too offensive or inappropriate. Unsurprisingly, libraries can't exactly do much about that except remove them from the shelves if absolutely necessary. However, when you think about it, if everyone complained about a certain book being offensive, there would eventually be no more books! For example, I would not want my little brother reading *those* books because some chapters *of the book* contain a sex scene. However, my brother will eventually be older, and he'll be able to understand. If I would have gotten rid of that book, I wouldn't be letting other people enjoy it. If you were to get books removed that were about **LGBTQ+ RIGHTS** because you were **HOMOPHOBIC**, many **PEOPLE** wouldn't be happy to say the least. This could be about any subject matter, however. The more books that are removed from the library, the less people will know about the subject. Eventually, as I've said before, there will be no more books left! Everyone has their own opinion of what is appropriate or not, and everyone's views are different. The solution to this problem is simply to not remove the books. Sure, you might get complaints, but odds are, more people are unoffended rather than offended. Americans do have the right to fight for this, but with the majority being unoffended, it's a tough case to win. I believe all books would be fine left on shelves. If you take off one book, you might as well take off the rest. Next time you are picking out a book, and you find it offensive, think about how other people might want to read it; they might even need the information for a paper they're writing for a class. You never know who might need the information. Don't be selfish; keep the books on the library shelf, as limiting access based on personal offense ultimately harms the pursuit of knowledge and understanding for everyone.
1427	4404	2	3	Tuff @CAPS1 for a little @CAPS2. Censorship is a problem we are faced with today. I believe there are certain instances where censorship is necessary, but I also feel it must be kept in check. Thats why i have a great deal of reespect for organizations and industries that try and stop or put of censorship media untill your more mature and responsible enough to handle it.  The most common categories where censorship is not all right in my world are, books and music. A lot of books are very well writen and fabulous to read, but in history or racial, and more cultural books they use words/terms that are offensive to me and a lot of other people to. These books can be valuable for understanding different perspectives, but some find the language used within them hurtful.  Also, the main cause in thius is music. In today's society, nearly every person has an ipod and downloaded onto that ipod is music. Im not saying all music is terribly bad, but in most cases i hear about every word in the book and race topics. Rappers are setting bad examples for young adolecents like myself, who pose with guns and have marijuna and crack. Why do they do this? Just to mkae themselves more popular. That is hurting our education and making us think we shyould be criminals. While not all music promotes negative behavior, the influence of certain artists cannot be ignored.  I in my opinion enjoy magazines and tru informative facts from professional reporters. Tghe reporters are on the citizens side and trying to get the true facts out there for us the people. Maqgazines also, tell about annual celbrations and good things happening in the world. Whyere you can find out the scores of sports game and what the weather is going to be like. These sources offer a counterpoint by providing factual information and positive news.  Last year, i remeber reading 'To @CAPS3 a @CAPS4'. It was so contraversial and talked about blackl slaves and whites treatinbg them like dirt. Also, about black never win a trial and there treated unfairly. I felt embaressed and i was the only african american in the class. It was akward. I felt like if we had a discussion people would talk badly about iot then remember i was in the room then theyd stop. Facing such content can be particularly challenging when one feels isolated or vulnerable.  What is the world going to do? Censorship covers an entire multi media spectrum of what is bad and good censorship. It is up to the right people to stand up for what is right and wrong for your children and young adolecents in the world. To help fight this cause! Bring down all that is bad! We can do it, we will fight! Like @PERSON1 says, 'dont hope for a better change or wish for a new world.' If you want change you need to make it happen and stand up for whats right and make a differnce in the world. It is our collective responsibility to navigate the complexities of censorship and strive for a world where information is accessible yet responsible.
1428	4405	2	3	Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The material should be removed if they offend their gender. Also, the material should be removed if it offend's their religion. Finally, it should be removed if it offend's their race. The material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's gender. First, the material can make a person feel unworthy and diminish their self-esteem. Second, the material can cause an large altercation between the author and the person who is being offended and maybe others, leading to potential conflicts. Third, the material can also harm someone by them picking up the book and reading the text. Also, the material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's religion. This can cause someone to hate every other person with the same religion as the writer, song writer, actor, and/or director, fostering prejudice. Second, the library should be about education, fun, and interesting contents not by offending someones religion. Finally, this can cause a person or people to act as terrostist from this offensive content. The material also should be removed if it is offending someones race. First, the material @MONTH1 call the race of the person that is reading, listening or watching a name that's very offensive name( not directly but in general). Second the material can speak of the race as if was bad, promoting harmful stereotypes. Last, the material can influence other kids to disrespect that race and not like people of that race. The material that is offensive to anyones gender,religion, and/or race should be removed from the shelves of a library. the library is a place where everyone can read, listen, or watch about something that is interesting not to offend other people in all ways, ensuring a welcoming environment for everyone.
1429	4406	2	3	Often we go to the library searching for a good book or magazine to read without actually knowing what books are available. In order to find a book that interests you, you have to explore by picking up the book and looking at the cover and reading its background. Sometimes we come across a book or magazine that is innapropriete for children, and wonder why that book is still on the shelf for anyone to pick up. I believe materials that are offensive to some people should be permitted from the public library. To begin, the books selected to advertise on the shelves of a library are not restricted for a certain age level. Libraries are broken up into different sections on where to find a genre, but a young child might not be aware. I believe there are certain materials found in a library that should not be put out for the public. Perhaps you have a five year old child pick up a book about sex and drugs; this could lead the child to learn things they shouldn't know until they are older, exposing them to mature themes prematurely. To continue, offensive books should not be put into libraries because they give that library a bad reputation. If someone were to come from out of town and the first thing they saw on the shelves of a library was a book with a naked body or drugs, they would immediately be taken back. Offensive types of books can include books you wouldn't want a first grader to see and also books about racial or religion. Certain people would take offense to a book that was against what they believed in. This could result in a huge confrontation, disrupting the peace and purpose of the library. Lastly, offensive books can include books about someone's opinion on a certain topic. If someone against the writer's opinion started to read the book, they would automatically be offended by what the writer was saying. There is never an agreement when two people have a different look on something. To conclude, although some books are offensive to some people and not to others, we have to be aware of what might cause problems to certain people. I believe any book open about opinion, and books that would be 'x-rated' should not be kept in a public library. We could easily solve this problem by making a separate place to hold these books so people will not take offense to it, creating a more welcoming and inclusive environment for all library patrons.
1430	4407	2	3	What do you think about them taking books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive? Everyone has a different look on it. It is an important thing to think about. Just stop and think do you want your child looking at that when you are not around? Many would say no, because they are to young to know about stuff that shows to much and other reasons also.Taking all the ones found offensive off the shelves would be the best idea for the case of young teens, and childern. I believe that they should be taking off the shelves, and you have to be @NUM1 or older to buy them in many reason. The biggest reason I think they should is, kids under the age of @NUM1 want to look cool like the older teenagers, but really don't need to see that. With the young teenager think they need to do things like the stuff in music, movies, to be cool and think if they do that they @MONTH1 look cool. Young teenager don't think about what they are doing, and just think it ok because the older ones are doing it and they see it. With magazines, and movies, and music they need to be of age to buy. One big reason to believe that they should be taking off the shelves is because, a lot of kids and young teens thinks they can go in anywhere and look at things that are found offensive. There are a lot of different types, and you have to be of age to go into some places.With believing that they should take them off the shelves, it gives the @CAPS1 a fill free about your child to look at things without think about the offensive ones. I hope with reading my persuasive essay, I hope i relate to someone about the books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive can relize what i'm talking about with young teens around the ages of @NUM3 and if you take your child with you and they see something like that. With the a stuff I gave you it helps you see the out look on stuff that is offensive on the shelves. Ultimately, removing offensive materials from open access and restricting them based on age could create a safer and more appropriate environment for young people as they navigate the world.
1431	4408	2	3	Should books, music, movies, magazines, etc. be removed from libraries if they are found offensive? My opinion on this is no. In this essay I will explain my opinion and hopefully change other peoples opinions. I will also explain how the past has an effect on present day. In some cases books, music, movies, magazines, etc. may offend any race or a certain sex, but that is what happened in the history of the United States. Some may be very offensive but it only shows a past, others may just be plain out racist or sexist. Those that show the United States' history are an education source so we can learn from mistakes. Here is exactly why I state this opinion, taking this material off shelves is like taking someone's freedom of speech away. I hate when I hear music that disrespects women but I'm not going to try and get it taken away because it might just be expressing how the artist of the song loved someone or how history for their family may have been. In conclusion, I believe this material should not be taken off the shelves. After explaining my opinion think about what is offensive or just someone expressing a past memory. If a past was offensive something today might be offensive, as I was told earlier in my life treat others as you want to be treated. I hope I caught attention and changed some opinions because a lot of offense today has resulted from the past, and we should approach these materials with understanding and a desire to learn.
1432	4409	2	3	No. I believe that there should not be censorship in libraries. There are not many things 'offensive' or 'harmful' in most libraries in this state. I dont see who would come up with such an absurd idea. To me there are just way too many ways for people to get offended. This past November, I remind you that we almost changed our pledge to the flag of our country by getting rid of the word 'god' all because some people don't believe in god. Now we are supposed to get rid of good books just because they are child friendly?! Think about all the amazing books, movies and magazines that would have to be removed from our libraries just because one person says, 'I find this book offensive' or says, 'I don't think this book is appropriate for my child.' WHAT about the people that do like that book and now won't be able to read it anymore all because of that one person? There are sections in libraries for a reason! Just put the naughty books in the eighteen year or older section so younger kids don't see them. The people who want to get rid of so called dangerous books to children make libraries sound like there pornographic shops. Most libraries are not filled with horrible bad books that will cause their child to be mentally scared forever. Hell there are really that many books out there anyways. Now sometimes a bad book can end up in the kids section this November, but that does not mean we have to remove that book forever form all the other people who want to read that book. All librarie workers just have to make sure to put all books in their rightfull spots and nothing bad will happen. The bad books will be in the adult section and the child frendily books will be in another. Have some libabrie workers watching the area and make sure little kids don't go in the library. This will prevent children from seeing the bad books because they will be in the adult section. In conclusion I answer this question by saying no. There are just way too many good books that would have to be gone forever.
1433	4410	2	3	I believe that all literature of any kind is useful even though it could be offensive. If society plans on taking something off the shelf because it offends a race or gender, then many life-lesson books, movies, magazines, music, etc., would be removed from the shelves. Things such as books or movies are there to take people to different worlds, to help them learn knowledge, to teach them lessons that the real world might not teach them. If materials are taken off the shelf in fear of offending someone, then not very many things will be left just like Katherine Paterson says in her quote. If certain literature were not around anymore then it definitely would not be the same as it is now. Literature is there for us, they teach us, and if one book was taken away, it would start a riot. Books are always there for us, when we are bored, lonely, or just want to escape reality. Imagine if you were not able to read your favorite book because it was no longer considered appropriate for society. If all books had to be appropriate for every age, it would take all the interesting out of everything. Whether it is a novel or a regular encyclopedia, all books would be dulled down to exceed the needs of our 'non offending' society. Lots of music would lose its luster and magazines would not be able to gossip about the 'hottest new things.' Movies would get too boring to watch and many things in society would fall apart. Books, documentaries, magazines, are there to help people learn, either if its a lesson about what not to do while you are young, such as smoking, if books about smoking were taken away because it offended the part of society that chose to smoke then how would any of the teens today know not to start smoking? Novels are usually fiction, but the characters come to life to readers. They have problems just like people of the real world even though they might not be real themselves, so if one reads that book, the way that character handles the situation could help a real life person decide on what they should do about their problem. Important history books of movies could be taken away because it 'offends' African Americans to have students learn about slaves. If one book was taken from the shelf because of offending someone then more and more materials would be taken away from society. What good does that do anyone? It leaves many students uneducated about many things that they need to be educated about. It would disrupt the order in libraries if books were being removed because of appropriateness. If books were being judged on appropriateness then many authors would not be able to write the novels and literature that they do now. No good would come of removing anything from the shelves of libraries. Books, movies, magazines, music, it is all too important to society, it keeps us company, it teaches us, is makes life easier at times when the world wants to kick you while you are down. If one person decided that a book was not appropriate then they can chose not to read it, but they should not decide to help remove that book from the shelves of libraries. They would start a landslide of trouble that would effect everyone in the country and maybe even across the globe. Information of any kind is a good thing no matter the content of it. So removing any sort of material from our libraries is a horrible idea, and we should strive to keep all forms of literature available for anyone who seeks it.
1434	4411	2	3	The content in today's materials are not always suitable for young children. Information now distributed in the media and other networks can be harmful for some young children to read or be surrounded by, including video games. By growing up in a violent environment, children observe and have a greater chance at becoming violent. The continuance of censorship in today's materials is a necessity to the well-being of the children in today's society. In video games there are ratings that help explain what is suitable for each age throughout childhood and adolescence. Movies are also the same, making it harder for younger children to see certain movies. Books and magazines are not as well protected although they should be. Age and maturity plays a huge role in whether or not a child should be allowed to read and be introduced to specific material. Violence is a major trend in video games in today's world, and some of the influence it brings on children is unnecessary and eventually detrimental to their well-being.  The reason ratings should be changed is because children absorb their environment and become what they see, so if they are introduced to violent behavior they have a greater chance in becoming violent children. In libraries there are sections for every age group, specific genre of books, fiction, and non fiction. But some of the explicit material in books and magazines should also be censored before they are distributed on shelves and allowed available for young teenagers and children. As a part of the community libraries should take apart in the well being of the children and not expose them to information earlier than necessary.  Throughout my own experience, I have seen children grow up too fast when exposed to certain knowledge. Especially in today's music, radios do a good job in editing content in songs, by putting parental advisory on certain cd's, but this still does not stop them from buying the material. In games including, Grand Theft Auto of Rockstar Games, Call of Duty, etc. teens are now becoming accustomed to this type of behavior, that is not safe nor conducive for children. By censoring certain material it disallows the continuance of bad behavior amongst our youth today, ultimately protecting their innocence and fostering a healthier environment for their development.
1435	4412	2	3	READ WITH @CAPS1 I do not believe that libraries carry the responsibilty to censor reading materials. When a person enters a library, they immediately must infer that, because libraries are place in which knowledge is accumulated, that some of that information they find @MONTH1 not coincide with what they believe. If a person believes a book is offensive, they can just as easily put it down as they had picked it up. Obviously, however, there are certain exceptions. Childrens' sections, of course, should be limited to those intended for younger readers. Putting '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' into a childrens' section hardly seems logical, just as much as putting '@CAPS4 @CAPS5' into the adults section. In addition, author @PERSON1 once stated that if she was able to ban a book from a library, the same right would have to be given to all other patrons as well, thus leading to all the books in a library being unable to be read, the knowledge contained within them unknown. There are, as with any ordinance, exceptions. For example, if a library is intended solely for the use of younger audiences, censorship should hardly be considered a crime. The exclusion of inappropriate items, such as permisquous reading material, keeps childeren from formulating ideas about concepts they @MONTH1 not be able to fully understand. With all these things considered, banning books from a library hardly seems to be the best course of action. A library should be a place of enlightenment. Opposing ideas should be presented, leaving the readers to formulate their own decisions about what they believe, because books are like atoms: when two opposing types collide, a burst of energy is released, ultimately fostering intellectual growth and a more nuanced understanding of the world.
1436	4413	2	3	A library is a place for people of all ages to come and get a book, magazine, music, movies and much more. Libraries are a key essential to learning and helping those with reading skills. Studies show that reading will make you much smarter and able to understand and comprehend well. However, in my opinion, offensive reading, viewing or listening material does not belong in libraries, to some extent. As I stated earlier, libraries are a place of learning and for developing skills. Books that are for 'adults' can be found in adult type stores or even at a regular local book store. Parents bring their children to the library to support their reading ability and to advance it. They don't want to have to worry about making sure their kids are not looking at anything bad. A few years back, I herd about a teenage boy that would go into the library about once a week to look for movies that this parnents would not approve of. Later on that boy was caught and punished. If those kinds of movies were not there in the first place, his parents would not of had to worry about it. Almost everywhere you go and everything to see and hear has some type of wrong background to it. Parents should feel okay and worry-free when it comes to letting their kids do something as simple as going to the library. This problem can be easily fixed with removing that issue. I strongly believe that library material should be censored in the way that those who should not see it, can not see it. On the other hand, material such as religious or cultural learning items that people find offensive should not be taken off the shelves. Religious and cultural books, music, movies, and/or magazines are for those to learn. Form what I have seen, someone might want, for example, a book about Christianity taken off the shelf because they are Muslim and might not support their religious ways. I find this wrong because it is a free country that includes freedom of religion and they can't be denied informing others about that religion. Libraries are a place to feel safe and relaxed. Everyone likes to sit in the library for hours and soak in a good novel. Material that is found offensive does not belong their, unless it is for real educational learning, ensuring that libraries remain a safe and enriching environment for everyone.
1437	4414	2	3	The subject of censorship in libraries has been brought upon many times. Censorship is a rule prohibiting the view of a book, music, movies, magazines, etc. This censorship is because of it's rating or the content in it is inapropriate for some viewers/readers. Of course, many people have their own opinions about this censorship in libraries, as do I. I believe that censorship is a good idea in some cases. These cases being music, or movies. However, I don't believe censorship is a good idea in books. Children all over the world read books and as time goes on, our children are becoming more and more advanced and read on higher levels. This is where censorship comes into play. Libraries want to censor higher reading level books because these books include profanity, violence, sex, drugs, and any other aspect of adultry. I disagree with the censorship of these books because this is basically telling our children that they can't challenge themselves or they can't learn about certain things because of their age. These books, in my opinion, can only help them. These books will help them learn about society, what's wrong and what's right, and will help them, grow as they get older. The higher reading level books help them understand words better, and also help them learn about literature and past times. When I was in middle school, I was not an advanced reader by any means, but I did like to read occasionally. One day, I went to the library in search of a challenging book. The book I found was a book called 'The Book Thief' by Markus Zusak. This book was a fictional story taking place during the World War 2. As I put in my pin number to check out the book at the front desk, the librarian informed me that I couldn't check out the book because it was a young adult book, meaning 'too advanced' for me. She said I needed parent consent before I was able to check it out. That night, I asked my parents about it and asked if I could read it. They said yes, mostly because they were so thrilled that I even wanted to read a book so challenging. The next day I got a note from home informing the librarian that I could read the book. I was so thrilled when I was finally able to check out the book and read it. From my experience with the library censorship, I think that the best route to take is that if there is a parent/guardian who is over 18, and they approve of the checking out of the book/magazine or whatever it may be, then the child or student is allowed to check out said book/magazine etc. In conclusion, the censorship of books, magazines, etc. is an overall mediocre idea, with some exceptions. The rule of parent/guardian consent is the best route to take in my opinion. Of course, this subject will be argued for many years to come and many people will have their own opinions. Each side of the argument has valid points, but I think that it is imparative that we keep censorship out of books and keep our children learning and reading at their highest ability, no matter what the reading level is.
1438	4415	2	3	Should certain materials in libraries be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? I do not think books or any other materials should be taken off the shelves for some people? There are many reasons that the books should stay on the shelves. I am going to tell you all of the reasons I think the books should stay on the shelves. One reason I think the books should stay on the shelves is because some people might need the books for a school project. For example, a student could have a project over a controversial historical event. A book on a controversial historical event could offend many people. Just because it offends some people does not mean it should be taken off the shelf because other people might need that book. Someone might need a certain book for a project. If the one book they need is taken off a shelf because it offended someone they could fail a class. That is one reason I think the books should stay on the shelves. Another reason I think they should stay on the shelves it's their opinion if the book offends them. Just because they don't like the book and it offends them doesn't mean other people do not want to read it. Why would you take a book off of a shelf because it offends one or a couple people? There could be many more people who want to check out that book and read it. If a book offends you just dont look at it. Why would you look at something that offends you? I don't understand why libraries would have to removed a book from the shelf just because it offends someone. Especially, when that person could just ignore the book and pay no attention to it. That is my last reason my opinion is what it is. So after reading this I hope you understand why my opinion is what it is. There is no point in taking books off the shelves. People need them for research and projects, and removing these resources could hinder academic pursuits. It is someones opinion if they do not like what the book is about and if it offends them. For example, if i didn't like something on a menu at a resteraunt they are not going to take it off the menu for me. My last reason the books should stay on the shelves is the people can just ignore the books and not look at them that would be easier than taking books off the shelves. Ultimately, the decision to engage with potentially offensive material should rest with the individual reader, preserving access to a wide range of perspectives and information for all.
1439	4416	2	3	Is @CAPS1 Right? Is @CAPS1 right to have censorship in libraries? This question could be answered in two very different opinions. Some people @MONTH1 want all censorship items out of public areas. On the other hand, there are people that @MONTH1 like to read this type of material. This is a very opinionated topic. In my opinion, libraries are places I go to find a book to read, research, listen to music, rent movies, or relax while looking at a magazine. Libraries are public areas and not everyone is going to agree. Everyone has their own favorite book or genre. I believe @CAPS1 is unjustiful to take away censorship in libraries because this @MONTH1 be ones favorite genre. Why do libraries need to limit their choice while noone else does? For example, many parents would love if all clothes stores would ban holes in jeans because they are to revealing. The stores don't. They do not ban holes in jeans because many teenage girls like holes in their jeans. American @CAPS2 is not going to band capris just because I do not like them. There are different favorites, likes, dislikes, and opinions. A great resolution for this dissagreement is catorigizing. By putting all of the censorshiped books, movies, magazines, and music in one area, @CAPS1 will decrease arguments on this topic because all of the people that like censorship in libraries will be together in their area. Where as the people that do not want the censorship in libraries do not have to be around @CAPS1. This is a quick and easy fix for the complex situation. There is no reason to take away ones favorite genre because someone doesn't like @CAPS1. If this is true then our world will have nothing because not everyone likes one certain thing. For instance, I do not like blue aeropostale shirts. Pink are my favorite. My friend @CAPS3 likes the blue shirts and hates the pink shirts. We both write to the manager to get rid of the shirt color we do not like. This is nonbenifical for either of us because now the one we do not like is got but so is the one we do like. This is nonsense. There will be nothing left in the store. Pople in charge can easily sort material at a store or a library to make @CAPS1 fit the communities likings. Getting rid of material is not the answer. Catorigizing is the fix that needs to be put into action immediatly, allowing everyone to access the materials they desire without infringing on others' preferences.
1440	4417	2	3	In our society today there is an enormous amount of exposure to materials that many adults didn't have when they were a child. Young children today see drugs, alcohol, sex, and teen pregnancy portrayed as things a normal child's everyday life consists of. Certain television shows, books, and even some popular songs condone these behaviors that many parents are opposed to. While libraries might seem to be the most unusual place to have access to these materials, many young children can checkout books that are simply not appropriate for their age. Censorship of materials, such as books, movies, and music, that are found offensive or inappropriate are a way to teach young children that life isn't all about what the media portrayes it to be. One very important reason to allow censorship of materials in libraries is that you might not know what type of book you're looking at. Many children, and adults too, walk into the library and look among the books until they see a cover or a title that grabs their attention. While most of the books in a library are age appropriate a child can still grab a book that isn't something they should be reading. There are mass amounts of influential materials from the media and also from peers that a child is subject to. Censorship in a library will make it a safer place for children to go and pick up any book in the proper section for them and will also allow the parents to not have to worry about what their child has selected. As author Katherine Paterson so rightly said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf.' Parents should never have to worry about what their child can get ahold of in a public library. A second reason to allow censorship in libraries is that video stores already have censorship in their shops, along with ratings on all their movies and video games. Most video stores have a seperate section of movies that are deemed to have 'adult content' in them. A minor cannot walk into a movie store and go to the section of movies deemed for adults, or someone over the age of eighteen. A minor can't rent an R-rated movie without proving that they are seventeen, or they have an adult to rent it for them. The same thing occurs with video games, for example a video game with a rating of M, or mature, cannot be rented or bought by anyone under the age of eighteen. This censorship should be applied to libraries. Having seperate sections based on adult content allow movies and books to be set in a seperate location so that no child can possibly rent something that they have no intention of watching or reading. This type of censorship also allows for a parent to choose if their child can see it. An example of this would be for a sixteen year old boy. While he cannot go and rent the R-rated movie, if his parents deem it acceptable for him to see, then they can rent it for him. This gives the parent control of what their child sees, instead of the child having full control. This same type of censorship that video stores have is a perfect way to place censorship in a library. Perhaps the most important reason for censorship in libraries is the early exposure the materials give to the children. Many young children have been watching television shows or hearing things on the news that make it seem acceptable in our society to drink at parties when you're not of age, do illegal drugs for the feeling, and have sex at an extremely young age because it's what 'everyone's doing.' This is a very risky path to let the young children in our society take. Allowing our culture to become this way can lead to various sorts of problems, as we have seen all to well. Many young kids, some as young as fourteen or fifteen years old, go to parties and drink. When it comes to getting a ride home they go with their seventeen-year-old friend who has a license, and who has also been drinking at the party. Now hopefully the story ends that all of the children make it home safely, but that is not how it works in many cases. There have been so many drunk driving crashes recently in our nation with children who should not have even been drinking. This ties back to censorship because of the way these kids were pressured into drinking. Many adults in the society blame it on peer pressure; but where do the peers get the idea that this is acceptable? These ideas come from the influences that the society's children are susceptable to. Censorship in libraries is one way of restricting the ideas children are exposed to, and hopefully allowing them lead safer and healtheir lives. While there are so many other factors in the exposure to children of these materials, stopping the exposure in libraries is one way of eradicating early exposure. Young children in today's society and culture are exposed to excessive amounts of inappropriate materials. These three factors, the inability to know what
1441	4418	2	3	Library books offensive? The right to remove a book or not isn't up to us, people, per our opinions. If someone has an issue with the book; next time don't get it. I know that we shouldn't have the right to remove books from the librarys. It's not up to us to make that choice. I know people sometimes find somethings wrong or inappropriate in a book at the librarys', but if it wasn't to your liking don't read the rest of it or refer it to a friend. I have had problems with this before. I went to check out a book and my mom said that she didn't like the topic that it was about: honestly its her opinion. A person should have a right to his/her opinions but it shouldn't affect someone elses. One person @MONTH1 really like the book and someone else @MONTH1 hate it, obviously their are people out there who enjoy that type of book so there isn't a really good reason to get rid of it. The only person who should have a say in getting rid of a book would have to be the librarian. That person knows what is acceptable and what isn't for the library. If it includes something graphic or racist, you can talk to them about it in a clam conversation, because they maybe a librarian but they dont read every single book that is in the library. Some items can be offensive to some but not others. The library is there for knowledge and entertainment. We can have opinions on matters and discuss them appropriately without causing a big ordeal because their could be reasons why things are where they are. You need to leave the choice up to the person who is educated on the matter/ who is in charge of the library. Ultimately, decisions about library collections should rest with trained professionals who understand the principles of intellectual freedom and collection development, ensuring a diverse range of materials remains available for all.
1442	4419	2	3	To whom it may concern,  Censorship is an issue that has plagued our society for centuries. It is not only unnecessary, but unconstitutional. As Americans, we have certain rights that we are guaranteed by the documents that keep our society out of anarchy. If the right to pick what literature to read, watch, or listen to is taken away, where will that put our country? Censorship should by no means be allowed in our country today.  In the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, we are given certain rights. Some of these rights, including freedom of speech and freedom of the press, have already been constricted, which is 'wrong' in the eyes of the government, but nevertheless, it is taking place. We may not have 'lost' these rights, but they have definitely been constricted. Why should the government be able to tell us what to read? If censorship is allowed, what is to come is frightening. If our government, which is supposed to be 'for the people' tells us what we can read and not read, what is going to stop them from telling us what to wear, drink, or even eat?  Censorship in libraries is one of our biggest issues. There are countless examples on why censorship of written literature should not be allowed. For instance, if a college student is writing a research paper about the effects of rape on a child, but the government sees rape as 'too graphic', what is this student to do? He or she should be given the right to use what materials are necessary to write a fully-informed paper. But by censoring our libraries, and taking books out, the government is hindering the education of its countries youth.  Some American classics are also being speculated against. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has been known as a classic since it was written. It is used in classrooms everywhere around the country for education. But recently, the availability of the book has been questioned. Throughout the novel, the 'n-word' is used, but never as an insult. During the time-period of its writing, this word was more common, and had a much less severe meaning than it does in modern day societies. But because time has changed it's meaning, it is being removed from libraries and curriculums across the country. This is unlawful censorship. One of the greatest books of our time, an American classic, is being removed from the lives of our youth because of 'racy language'.  Censorship is not only taking place in written literature. Movies and music are also under the magnifying glass of censorship. Movies are rated for a reason, to give the viewers an age group for which the movie is appropriate. This is helpful to parents to be able to self-censor their children. But it is not up the the government to be able to choose what a specific child is able to view. It is a parents right to be able to expose or not expose their child to whatever they see fit, not that of our country's lawmakers.  Music is one of the biggest part of our society today. With the invention of iPods and portable devices, music has become much more common, and portable. Censorship is becoming more severe with the change of music style. The music styles of modern teenagers greatly differs from that of their grandparents. Almost nothing is seen as unacceptable by many of today's rappers, as displayed in their choice of lyrics. The music business is taking quite a beating for what has become the most popular. With the most common themes of sex, drugs, and money, it may seem offensive to some citizens, but others may just shrug it off as a normalcy. So how can someone say 'No, you may not listen to that,'? This should not be allowed, yet it is.  How can one person, or a group of people decide what is acceptable and what is not? They cannot. Censorship is morally wrong, as well as lawfully wrong. Taking the media from its citizens, such as books, movies, and music, is unconstitutional. What would our forefathers think of what censorship has become? Before you pull that 'unacceptable' book off the shelf, remember the rights of our great countries citizens, and the rights of individuals like yourself. The act of censorship infringes upon the freedoms that define our nation, and allowing it sets a dangerous precedent for further restrictions on individual liberties.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1443	4420	2	3	It is a prominent question of debate whether or not certain materials in libraries such as books, music, movies and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Although there are materials that might be harmful to children, freedom of information is far more importiant than protection because censorship is unconstitutional, prevents readers from an impartial perspective, and in some cases hides pressing societal issues that are deemed improper by the censors. The FIRST AMENDMENT states that freedom of speech, religion and the press shall not be denied or abridged. In more general terms, the FIRST AMENDMENT grants freedom of expression. Censorship is effectively unconstitutional. It prevents freedom of expression. Students and scholars alike cannot access all information that should be avaliable to them if not for censorship. Although private business and libraries can be permitted to censor because they have their own contracts that permit this, public libraries and schools are effectively breaching the constitution when they censor. Censorship prevents a whole and complete perspective on an issue. Censors often ban particular books because of personal views of alleged 'immorality.' Withought a clear and complete access to all information, how can one make any valid conclusion about anything? If, for example, one wants to learn the difference between an agnostic philosophy and a deist one, but has no access to any agnostic books, which were banned by intolerant religious zealots, you cannot effectively learn anything. Every special interest group wants to ban a certain type of material. Author Katherine Paterson said that 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Indeed this is true. If every special interest group deems it proper to censor material that is against their interests, there will be no material left. There will be no knoledge left. Withought knowledge, we as a human race are left in the dark. Many books are banned that address great problems of society. Ray Bradbury's FAHRENHEIT 451 addressed the growing problems of censorship and the dangers of technology. As the fireman Guy Montag burnt books, so ironically the novel was censored. Perhaps this is a ploy by the censors to defend theire special interest, that is censorship. They feel powerfull when they restrict other people's freedoms. A novel by Kurt Vonnegut, SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, was banned. Apart from vulgar language in the book, SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE also denounced free will and portrayed the US's brutal bombing of Dresden in WORLD WAR TWO. This book reveals much about human truth, yet it was banned. How will society ever change if any time a revolutionary book is written it is banned? Censorship is a great problem. Although there are many works that are meaninglessly violent, brutal and cruel, no book or any other material should be censored. In public libraries and schools, censorship is blatently unconstitutional. Censorship prevents people from seeing the whole perspective, and censorship hinders societal change. Therefore, censorship must be denounced as a restriction on our inteligence and liberty, an obstacle to progress that must be overcome.
1444	4421	2	3	Children are our future because when I am old they will be the ones who are caring for me, so for me censorship is big deal for me. It's a big deal not only because of how it will affect my children, but because it will affect me and what everybody else will be able to read. I agree that censorship is an importaint issue but to what extent should it be taken. People should have the right to read what they want to. They should also be allowed to find it in their local public libraries. My veiw on censorship in public libraries is that most things should be allowed to stay on the book shelf. I can understand censorship to an extent, but taking books out of a public libraries makes it hard to chose where to draw the line. You don't want a book taken out just because it has a bad word in it. Just because some books are classics that everyone knows, does that mean that we shouldn't take that book out of a public library? I do beleive that some books should stay because adults don't want to be reading kids books they most likely want to be reading a more complex book. I think their are some books that should stay out of the library though. A example is books that are extremly racist. These books should be kept far away from are children. This is needed because younger children might try to act out things they might hear or read because there are audio books and those would just make them say those things. This could cause them to get in trouble for things they don't understand yet. There is things that you can do as an alterative to keep these things out of the hands of children. There is already one that is used in public libraries and it is seperateing the adutl books from the children books. You could also move these two sections to oppisite sides of the library. the books that are more explicit cold be put higher up such as on a top shelf. Most kids would not be able to reach as high as a adult. Maybe even require parental permission for certain materials. These are my veiws and ideas on censorship in libraries. The ideas and veiws that I have are most likely different than most people. I thought that they were good ideas though. Ones such as seperate section for kids and adults. I thought my best one was puting the more explicit books up higher and moving the sections farther a part. Ultimately, striking a balance between protecting children and upholding intellectual freedom is a complex challenge, but these suggestions could help navigate that delicate balance.
1445	4422	2	3	Books, music, movies, and magazines are all a form of expression. We have the freedom to express the way we feel or think, but can it be too graphic for some to read? I believe censorship in libraries are needed to protect the minds of children and people who are easily influenced by the thoughts of others. Books are a major factor in expressing the way one feels about a topic from romance to horror. Many children like to read books or comic books that involve a great deal of violence. Children's minds are like sponges, which means they soak up anything they read about and it has a great chance at influencing their functioning to everyday activities. If you go into a music store you will find many different types of music from rap to blue grass. I've noticed in my school that a particular type of music that stands out is rap and the favorite artist is Youngboy NBA. Youngboy NBA has been known for rapping about drugs, sex, money, and violence. Many teens think that if their favorite artist can do all this why can't they? I've only listened to a few songs by Youngboy NBA and in every song one of those four key topics comes up. Like Youngboy NBA the movie industry is starting to come out with more and more movies about drugs, sex, money, and violence. Many students in my school talk about the latest comedy movies like 'Grown Ups', 'The Hangover', 'Ted' ect. and how they turned their life into something like those movies when they go on summer or winter break. Movies like those are funny to watch but for someone who is easily influenced shouldn't be watching them. Books, music, movies, and magazines, they surround us with their stories and thoughts of another human being. We do have the freedom and the right to express ourselves but we also have the right to take it away if we feel it is endangering the minds of others. I think censorship in a library from certain things is a good option in cleaning up a mind poisoning mess and ensuring that individuals are not unduly swayed by potentially harmful content.
1446	4423	2	3	I think anything offensive should be removed from shelves because it's inappropriate. Books should be enjoyable and educational; while some violence might be acceptable in action/adventure books to set the mood and context, offensive books can be problematic. Comedy that makes fun of things can be interpreted as offensive or as a joke, but many people would prefer such books removed. Offensive books can negatively influence children, as young minds are highly impressionable and likely to remember harmful lessons. These books should be taken off shelves because children are already exposed to similar content on television and in conversations. They need educational books to prepare them for future academic levels, allowing them a fresh start with new words and grammar, so removing potentially harmful books is a good idea.
1447	4424	2	3	I think they should be taken off the shelves if they are too vulgar for young children. Like if it has to deal with sex or violence they should be taken off shelves. They should only be allowed to put appropriate stuff on the shelves. I think that they shouldn't even make books or magazines like that unless they can keep them hid from people under the age of 18. But people are gonna do what they want to do. Ultimately, it's about protecting children, but enforcing that is difficult because of differing opinions and personal freedoms. That's all I have to say. Have a nice day.
1448	4425	2	3	Katherine Paterson made a valid point in stating that some books are too offensive for some people to read, but that does not mean they should not be read. Time and time throughout someone's life we hear things that we do not like nor want to be bothered with, but it is good that we do. Libraries should have the right to open all types of books to their shelves and not have them be censored by the public, this is why. We, as people of the United States, have battled through hard times. Segregation, racism, and extreme poverty or depression are just a few to recall. Having dealt with those issues we always tend to repeat them out of lack of knowledge. Slavery and the Civil War were some of the United States's lowest moments and they were also very gruesome. Recalling those memories is difficult but something that needs to be done; if books were to be censored then many young adults would not be educated and could repeat such horrible actions. Pertaining to movies, music and magazines the same laws applies. Though not in the same way, many times these publications are written about current news or social aspects of life. Music is a form of expression and everyone has their own taste. Not having the option to choose from a variety of styles is wrong and unfair. Music can not only be an expression feeling about love or angry but it can also teach life lessons. Some artists like to sing or rap on their life journey. This can educate others in to knowing that if you do this then this is the result, good or bad. In a magazine they tend to lean towards more current topics such a politics, jobs, or young adults lifestyles. Movies apply to the same rights and topics. Each one is equally as important and if a group of citizens feel that it is not then who are they to make that call. What gives a group of people the right to say this is inappropriate and that you should not read it? They do not have it. In the constitution it states that you have freedom of speech and that means you can express it anyway you choose. By censoring what people read that is in a way taking away that author right to speak. Now, that is unfair. Though Katherine Paterson made a valid point in saying that some books are too offensive to read, she simply is not right. A library is supposed to be a place where people can find a book, music, movie, magazine of any genre and read it. If materials were censored then that is unfair to someone else who does want to read it. Bottom line is that you have free will and you have the power to choose whether or not you want to read something, and censorship infringes on that fundamental right.
1449	4426	2	3	There are things in the world that are not meant for certain people to see. Things like rated R movies, adult books, alcohol, and explicit music are not meant for children. Yes people have rights, they can view whatever they want. If a child wants to see a rated R movie or drink a beer that is the parents choice to let that child see that movie not the person running the store. If you are under the age limit a store keeper should have the right to tell you, you can't go in the store or buy his product. Is it okay for a storkeeper to to tell your child no? Some would say yes to this and others would say no. If your child is trying to buy a movie with guns, blood, and killing, and you don't want your child to have this movie you might be mad if a store keeper let your child buy it. On the other hand you might be mad if this store keeper told your child he wasnt allowed to buy this movie. If the rated R is based on maturaty how does this store keeper know how mature your child really is? Your child could be a one that likes to copy the things they see on movies, the store keeper doesn't know if this is true or not. He doesn't know this child, he can't say if he is mature enough to watch this movie with guns, blood, and killing. How would this store keeper feel if this child watched this movie he let the child buy and the child went out and killed someone, how would you feel if this happened? This wouldn't happen if there was an age limit. If a group of 16 year olds who just got their license go into a liquor store and try to buy beer, who is going to stop them from drinking and driving if there is no age limit on drinking? Lives get wasted when teenagers make choices like drinking and driving. When your 17 years old you don't think about whats going to happen after you make a choice, you just think about how fun it's going to be while your doing it. Most 12-17 year olds aren't mature enough to make decisions in the spure of the moment. There for there should be an age limit for some things, maybe not all things in the world, like weather or not your child can buy a candy bar or a soda. But an age limit on buying an R rated movie, alcohol, guns, knives exc. What would the world be like if children went around with these things? With an age limit on ceritain this there wouldn't be a probelm with these things, ensuring a safer and more responsible society for everyone.
1450	4427	2	3	What do you go to the library for? In earlier times libraries used to be the place where you went to study. They were no computers, and so you had to go look up your work in a educational book at the library. Is that truly what people are doing at the libraries now, or are people there to look at vulgar books, magazines, and movies? A library is meant to be the place where you can go to work in peace and have a helpful resource of educational books. But, now you can go to the library and be tempted to look at books you shouldn't be looking at. Instead you could be on the computer the whole time playing games of some sort. The possibilites are endless. People now could go to the library and check out a magazine, movie, or book on: pornagrophy, drugs, achlocol, or worse. Is that really what you want your kid to accidently pick up at the library? Presonally I myself witnessed a little kid pick up a porn magazine at the library, and his mom had to grab it very fast before he had the chance to look at the magazine. The library should not be used for this, and the treat of young kids accidently looking at these materials should not be happening in the library. The music some one could listen is also very bad, and your child could listen to that. Then what if they want to keep listening to it? Yes, the world does have a huge impact on what is put into the library; because, drugs, sex, scandals, and achlocol seem to be what most teenagers are intereseted in at some point in their young life. But a library is a community building and there is no stopping some one from coming in and easily getting these vuglar things. The thoughts of the youth is completely swayed after they watch, read, or listen to this. And, this needs to be controled. Women and children can find all of these materials offensive, creating an uncomfortable and potentially harmful environment. These materials need to be censored more then what the are right now, or at least placed in a section that requires permission to enter. Libraries should be a safe place where people can go to study or get a book, and not to be tempted to look at something they should not be looking at. Many people find this offensive. Yes, in the end libraries are a great place, but the people who do not use libraries for the right reasons are why these materials need to be censored at the libraries, to ensure a safer and more appropriate environment for everyone.
1451	4428	2	3	A library card is one thing a kid always looked forward to. It's the first piece of identification that many kids have that they are allowed to carry around themselves. The card opens up a whole new world of entertainment and storys that can take you anywhere you want to go. Once a kid owned a library card, they were allowed to check out any book they wanted out of the huge selection of items in a library. But how do you keep a young child from checking out a book, movie, or magazine about inappropriate adult material? A solution to this problem should be formed so that people can be protected from material they don't want to see in a book, movie, or any other source of entertainment. Libraries today normally have a specified children's section, where picture books and short stories litter the shelves. The rest of the building is a scattering of books and other materials sorted only by author name and genre. The only way to understand what the item is about is to flip through the pages or read the back cover and try to find a hint of how the plot goes. This could be dangerous at times because not all materials give a specific summary of what happens. I once rented a movie expecting it to be a scary thriller about a killer in a trailer park. It ended up being scary for another reason, as multiple uncensored sex scenes were displayed throughout the first couple minutes of the feature. I had no idea the movie was going to involve scenes like that and I was disgusted that there was no warning. I believe items like that should be placed in a seperate area or at least be required to give a summary of the kind of offensive material in them. Libraries could collect viewer comments, allowing people who had checked out an item to write what they thought about it. People could then read these comments before checking out that item. Viewer comments would be a good way to get someones else's opinion on what the item contained before another decided to rent it. Another way to let viewers know would be to have a more in-depth description of the material in the library's online catalog. Another effective way to help this problem would be to give materials a certain rating, like the ratings of movies when they come out in theaters. A specific rating would warn viewers or readers from checking out an item that is offensive or inappropriate. Libraries could also give specific age ranges according to the ratings on an item, not allowing anyone under a certain age limit to check out a book from the building. Ratings would help keep offensive books out of a child's hands, or that of anyone else who didn't want to be exposed. Libraries hold all different kinds of materials about any subject you could think of. They can open a whole new world to learn and be entertained but also a world of inappropriate items. I believe items with offensive material should be either put in a seperate area, or given a certain rating in order to warn people before checking it out. Allowing viewers to make comments about the material could also be very helpful. Libraries are a wonderful place full of great stories and adventures, so they should not be polluted with offensive and inappropriate material, and these simple changes could help ensure a more positive and informed experience for everyone.
1452	4429	2	3	Do you find books you read offensive? How about music, or magazines? I sure don't. I can't think of why someone would be offended about a book they chose to read. If you sit back and think about it, there should be a low amount of reasons that someone should be offended by a book that is written for the general public.  I believe that it is possible for there to be books that have offensive words or actions in them, but unless they are directed towards the reader, or intentionally being used to offend someone then it is just a book. A lot of books, especially ones on history, use language and actions that were used during that time. They use them to show you and inform you on how things used to be and what it was like during the time. Not very often, or that I have ever seen, do the authors make a book to just to put someone down. I tend to see books just explaining things and using offensive words just to show how things were and to set a tone of the book.  Music on the other hand could be thought of as different. Many people could take music in the wrong way. A majority of offensive problems spawning from music come from the genre of rap. Rappers tend to express themselves thoroughly, and in doing that often times use very offensive language. I personally don't get bothered by the music, because they are usually referring to their own life and how things went with them. Music can also be on the good side too. When you get the calm and collective music, it tends to help people and can be used to help people relax. Therefore music can be either way, but it mostly goes about who the person is and how they react to what they listen to.  Then you have magazines. Personally I think they are the worst of all. Magazines tend to go one way or the other. They either put a person down and be completely negative towards them, or they are positive and say nothing but good about them. One big problem with magazines is that they write down what they hear and what they want to hear, not always knowing the full story. In that case they have a very high chance of being very offensive towards the person or group they are talking about. Magazines always have a positive, but where there is a positive they have a harsh negative thing to put in with it. The media landscape is complex, and magazines often prioritize sensationalism.  In these regards, I believe that there is nothing wrong with a library. There are always going to be negatives and positives, but libraries tend to stick with the positive side. Plus if a book looks like it might end up being offensive towards you, then there is no one that can tell you that you can't just put it down and stop reading it. With music, only get stuff that you like and if you are easily offended don't listen to that music. Libraries just give you the opportunity to possibly get something you could enjoy. There is no reason someone would not be able to refrain from going in and getting an offensive book. In saying this, it can go either way, and as long as you can use your own good judgment, there is nothing wrong with libraries or their censorship policies.
1453	4430	2	3	Imagine your favorite book, song, and movie. The ones that you love to watch, listen to, or read a million times over. The ones that you keep on checking out from the library again and again because you love it so much. Now imagine it gone from the libraries. What happened to it? You think that it has been checked out, but later you find that it has been removed from the shelves because someone found it offensive. What can you do? When you go to the library, you usually expect a huge selections of books and other materials to choose from. A library helps many people of all ages be able to choose whatever they are interested in. This is one reason why libraries are so popular among all people. If the libraries were to begin to remove items off of the shelves that they found offensive, many people would not be able to find all the items that they enjoyed anymore. I believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Libraries should accomodate as many people as they are able. Removing material from the shelves would make some people happy, but it would also take away items that many people find enjoyable. Libraries should not remove items from the shelves if they are found offensive. Doing this could result in less material for people of all ages. If you find something to be offensive, all that you have to do is not check the book or other material out. In Katherine Paterson's words, 'If I have the right to remove a book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on teh shelf for any of us.' I believe that if items were to be removed from the shelves, there would be less for others to enjoy. Taking materials off of the shelves would be unfair to all readers. Everyone has a favorite book or movie that they love to read or watch. If someone were to disagree with this, this would not only disable you from reading or watching what you love, but it also takes away from other readers who didn't have a chance to make their own opinions on the material. Many people have different ideas on what they feel is offensive. While some might think that some books have subjects too racy for readers, others might not feel that this is not the case. Take a popular childrens book like Shel Silverstein's *The Giving Tree*. To some, this might be one of the best books ever written. If someone disagreed with this and felt that it was too serious or offensive to young readers, many new readers would never know this book. They would have never had the chance to make their own opinions. I feel that censorship in libraries is an extreme show of personal opinion. It is only natural to disagree with someone. You can always run into people that don't share the same feelings about certain types of music or movies. Eliminating material from the shelves would be unfair to people. If everyone were to take their least favorite book off of the shelves and replace it with one they like better, soon the libraries would be filled with items that would only reach out to a certain audience. Libraries are meant to fulfill everyone's desires and taste. To conclude, taking items off the shelves because they are offensive to someone would not be fair. In fact, I believe that doing so would create more problems for people. If an item that someone was looking forward to checking out was no longer available due to censorship, many people might even decide that they don't want to go to the library anymore. What is great about the library is that you have a huge selection of items to choose from. If censorship were to take place, the library would no longer be a place to enjoy. Censoring material would be like telling a reader that their opinions were not as important as those of the people who found it offensive. I believe that if you find something so terribly offensive that you don't want it available to check out at the library, first think to yourself what you would do if the library didn't have your favorite things, because after all, what you think is offensive might be the best thing in the world to someone else.
1454	4431	2	3	Everyone has books that they do not like or do not approve of. What if one of your children came home from a library with one of those books? My view on censorship in a library is that if you don't like it then don't read it. I think they should have a children's section and an adult section in the library so you won't have to worry about the problem. If a child wants a book from the adult section then he or she would need to have a parent with them. That way the kid wouldn't bring home any books that their parent wouldn't approve of or allow them read. If you are an adult and you don't like a book then simply just don't read it. Maybe other readers like the book and don't want it taken off of the shelf. They wouldn't be able to say that the reason they want it off of the shelf is because they don't want there children to see it because there children would need there permission to check out the book anyways. This way, the focus remains on individual choice and parental guidance, rather than imposing a blanket ban on materials. I think this way would be much easier for all readers to enjoy the library, and they would not have to worry about picking out a book they don't like or their parents would not approve of, preserving the freedom to read while respecting individual values.
1455	4432	2	3	No, I don't think that certain books, music, movies, magazines should be removed from our libraries. They could be placed in another part of the library away from all the other books that aren't offensive. If they did decide to remove these books, kids would have a hard time learning about the truth, because book publishers often put only what they want our kids to learn, leaving out bits and pieces about what really happened. If they took the offensive books, music, movies, and magazines out, a lot of kids would just go home everyday and sit around or cause trouble. From my own experience, I enjoyed reading, listening, and watching the offensive materials they want to take out of our libraries. So if you don't like the offensive materials then don't even look at them; that will solve your problem, and teach your children that too. Overall I think they should keep the offensive materials, since exposure to different perspectives is valuable. If people still complain, move it to another part of the library, in a separate room or something of that kind, which should solve the problem of kids reading, listening, and watching these kinds of things while preserving access for those who wish to engage with the material.
1456	4433	2	3	As a responsible individual, I believe censorship is largely unavoidable and shouldn't be a major concern. If a particular magazine, book, or movie doesn't appeal to you, simply don't engage with it. Many people exercise this choice daily, while others find value in the same content. It's a matter of personal preference, and exposure is not mandatory. Instead of advocating for complete removal, focus on guiding your children or yourself away from content you deem unsuitable.  Censorship can broaden perspectives and provide information. The choice of what to absorb is yours, and some content, while potentially controversial, can stimulate imagination in children, provided they are mature enough to distinguish reality from fiction. It can also impart valuable knowledge about real-world events, fostering informed opinions. While parents can offer guidance, allowing children to form their own judgments based on experience is essential.  Furthermore, censorship can serve as an escape for individuals. People find enjoyment and solace in various forms of media, and restricting access can lead to frustration and unhappiness. While shielding children is a valid choice, those who can handle diverse content shouldn't be deprived of it. Libraries should maintain a wide range of materials, and parents can supervise their children's selections. Libraries offer access to information for those who cannot afford to purchase books.  Finally, censorship maintains interest and provides knowledge. It entertains and expands vocabulary. Libraries offer accessible resources for those with limited means. Offended individuals are not obligated to engage with the material, and they shouldn't impose their preferences on others. Banning content in one location won't eliminate it entirely, as children are already exposed to diverse material. They need a comprehensive understanding of the world. Censorship is subjective, and while some may find it objectionable, others may find it enlightening. Let people make their own decisions; imposing restrictions will only lead to reciprocal objections, so embrace the principle that words, unlike actions, should not cause harm, and accept the inevitability of diverse viewpoints.
1457	4434	2	3	I do not believe that these types of books should be taken off of the shelves. Everybody has their likes and dislikes with music, books, movies, magazines, etc. If the reader does not like the book, then the reader will not continue reading the book. If the listener does not enjoy rap music, then they will stop listening and try to find a different kind of music. This topic is about personal opinion and choice. If it was me, then I would say yes to allowing uncensored materials. I like getting the full effect out of things. I wanna hear the rawness of a song or the anger of a character in a book. I don't want to read and see a bunch of little stars on a censored word. I want to see that word and feel its full effect. I am actually reading the very controversial book 'HUCKLEBERRY FINN' of SCHOOL. As you MAY know the author of this book is named MARK TWAIN. Another thing you MAY know is the use of the 'N-word'. This is a very controversial book because he doesn't call colored people black or colored, he calls them the 'N-word' throughout most of the book. Most people now think this is very racist. But back in AMERICA's time it was very commonly said and used in his society. It wasn't racist back in that time, I mean it still was but it wasn't as controversial as it is today. Now critics and some readers don't agree with this term and think the book should not be held in libraries or read at all for that fact. I have to disagree though. I understand why he used the word, it was a common word in his time. If you take that word away from the book, you lose some history of the old south. People have the freedom of speech to say whatever they want to say, whether that be in written form or verbally said. I honestly say some of these censored words. Most of the time these words are said when I am angry at myself or another person. People can't control what we say, so why should they be able to control what we write or sing? Just a thought. Saying that, on the other hand I can see why people don't want these censored words. Maybe they just don't want their little kid to say a censored word in class to the teacher or to another classmate. That's understandable, but you can't protect your kids from censored words. They are everywhere. From video games, to movies, and even most books now. You cannot control what other people do or say. It is their freedom to do whatever they want, and that is why censorship, while understandable to some extent, ultimately infringes upon personal choice and historical context.
1458	4435	2	3	I don't think that censorship in libraries is right, for many reasons. First reason is that all books and contents that a public library offers to the community should be open to everyone. Second reason is that what you might think is not appropriate, to someone it might not be. Last reason is that an author has the right to express himself on his book how he feels, without having to worry that his book might be taken off the shelves of public libraries. My first reason why I think that censorship is not right is that all contents of a library should be open to the community. For example if a student needed to do research on how black slaves were treated back in history, he might not be able to find a book, to find information on it because someone thought books like that are offensive to black people, so in this case this student wouldn't be able to find any information on his topic, because of the censorship in his library, so instead of going to a library he will have to go somewhere else, where he might find the wrong type of information. Second reason is that what you might think is offensive, might not be to another person. So why should your point of view affect another person. It wouldn't be fair that a point of view of one person would limit the choices that a person has when he goes to the library. Censorship could take away your favorite series of books of the public library because of group of people thought it was offensive. My last reason is that an author has the right to express himself on his book how he wants, without having to worry that his book might get taken off the shelves of public libraries for its contents. Sometimes the content that books have is needed to make the book for descriptive, and interesting to the reader. Content that you might think is offensive, is the content that really helps the reader understand the book better. This are the reasons why I think that censorship is not right. Because if we had censorship on public libraries, then we wouldn't have any books left on the shelves for us to read. So these are my reasons to support my opinion, highlighting the importance of unrestricted access to information and diverse perspectives in public libraries for the benefit of all.
1459	4436	2	3	No book should be taken off the shelves for any reason. Books are a very important part of most peoples daily lives. Whether they are used for school or just entertainment they are used for a good purpose and are always helpful. People have different likes and interests and everyone wants to be able to read what they want without having to worry whether the books will still be on shelves tomorrow. For some people books are a great past time. They help you learn and even help with hard life situations. Books are the world to most people and without them those people would not know what to do with their lives. No one should be aloud to take something away that is important to other people even if it is offensive.  All books have a purpose and a message that they want to get out or else the authors would not have taken time out of their lives to write them down and have them published. The author writes to tell people a story whether good or bad, he or she wanted to get that story out there to inform people. The stories are obviously important to the author and important to the readers that enjoy their books. The authors should not be punished just because someone is offended by what he or she wrote. If people are so offended then they should just stay away from the books that the certain author writes. There are plenty of books out there and many different authors that the person can choose from. They do not have to take it out on certain authors just because they did not enjoy what other people might. It is important to maintain diverse perspectives and voices.  There are so many books out there and odds are there is always going to be a book that offends someone. If we get rid of every single book that offends people then we are not going to have many books left, and without books we have nothing. Books are the key point to education and most peoples daily lives. We will not learn the new ideas that authors put out there for us if people just keep getting offended and taking them off the shelves.  Books need to stay on the shelves. They are important to everyone, whether they want to admit it or not. Without books people would not be where they are today, so it is vital to protect access to them.
1460	4437	2	3	Libraries should censor some of the materials that they have available to the public. This is important because a child could easily gain access to offensive material. Censorship is very important for libraries because we do not want our children getting influenced by offensive materials found in their libraries. The libraries would not even have to get rid of the offensive materials that they took from the shelves. A good idea for them to do is to move all of them to a section for adults so the children will not be able to see them. This way, access can be restricted based on age. The libraries would not be losing any money and they would be keeping the youth away from things that are not appropriate for them. Their is no reason to give people access to material that could be offensive to other people. There are only a few reasons why I think that people should have access to offensive materials. Someone could need to use a book that has something offensive in it, but they would all be taken away to somewhere else. I think that it depends how offensive the materials are, as to whether or not they should be removed from the shelves. Although I am sort of split on this issue, there are some very good reasons why to move the offensive materials away from the shelves. Those materials are not appropriate for the youth of our country, and they should not have access to them. We should censor the libraries so that nobody gets hurt; ultimately, safeguarding children outweighs the potential inconvenience of restricted access for adults.
1461	4438	2	3	Book @CAPS1 @CAPS2 my name is @CAPS3 and I dont think @CAPS4 book's,magizines and etc. should be taken off the shelf because. Book's help people read and concentrate. In my case the more book's the better and these book's have been here to keep us occiupied. Without them we would have no bref discripson or what happened in the past. Book's have alway's been here to support us and every story must have some fun detail. Without book's I don't know what we would be doing without them. Book's have been the greatest thing in my life and @CAPS5 hurts for us to know that you wan't to get rid of them after, you made us read them when we where kid's so what is the point of getting rid of them when we got this far. In magizine's there's lot's to know about our people and how we live. We have gotten this far to go to the top. At least when we do read we know how to do some certain things For instance, do you remember when you were a kid and you alway's hated reading but now, a whole new change went into your life and you now know what to do. My fravorite book I have ever read was the @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 was inapporite but @CAPS5 also had meanning. We have to keep these stories alive and im not going to let you take the thing we love to do away. I love book,s and I hate to see them go away. these book,s were here when we were kid's and we have to keep the lagacy up. Reading is the best thing in life and @CAPS5 helps clear our mind's. Thanks to reading I was able to explain to you this much and how supportive I am with these book's. @CAPS5 would devestate our country,states,cities,school's and reading clubs so please don't remove our book's thats all we ask and not only will you make me happy but you'll make our reader's very happy. Thank you for reading this and have a nice day. Therefore, it is evident that keeping books accessible is crucial for both individual growth and the well-being of our communities, and their removal would be a significant loss for everyone.
1462	4439	2	3	Although possibly offending some people, materials that are in libraries that could possibly be considered 'offensive' are actually good to keep around. If people who find the materials in libraries offensive are getting upset over the lack of censorship within the library itself, they should re-think the situation and consider that the 'offensive' materials that are left within libraries could be considered appropriate IF the viewer is ready to experience them. If a person does not want to be exposed to things in libraries that could be considered offensive, then they can altogether avoid these materials. If parents find the materials that are within libraries offensive, they should monitor their children while they are visiting their library. The materials that could be considered offensive might actually be good, educational media that a person could learn from. If censorship within libraries increases, 'then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Censorship in libraries should remain the same as it is now. Some books, movies, and any other number of things that can be found within libraries are being labeled as inappropriate. These materials can be educational, however, and should not be removed from libraries altogether just because some of the materials are found to be too crude, vulgar, or adult-like for younger ages. Parents should monitor their children while in a library as to not let them stumble upon something that they would not want them to see yet. If something is labeled as inappropriate for children to view by parents, then it is the parents responsibility to make sure their child does not stumble upon it. Much of what might be considered as inappropriate and needing censorship in libraries to this day might actually hold some educational value or meaning to it. There are books and movies that are based off of true stories that have taken place that could be announced by parents as 'not appropriate to be viewed by children'. However, this does not mean that libraries should have to remove the material from their shelves just because parents might not think or necessarily agree that it would be appropriate for their child to read or see. It is the parents responsibility to see that their child does not check out what they would consider inappropriate. Much of the things within libraries that might be considered inappropriate for children hold good educational value and should not have to be removed from the shelves of the library simply because parents find it not age appropriate for their children. Censorship in libraries should remain the same as it is now so that those who want to see or read the stories or movies can do so without having to buy them. If parents want to make a big deal out of how libraries hold materials that are not appropriate for their children, they can either altogether not go to a library or they can monitor their children closely if they bring them along on a library visit. I have found that when I visit my library, I look at it as a source of knowledge that has been pooled in one place, written and created by thousands of authors, all of which took time out of their own lives to create it. If we are going to remove these books or movies from libraries, I think it would be taking away the rights that people have to the materials that SHOULD be provided by a library. Censorship in libraries should remain the same as it is today so that people can enjoy all that should be within it, even if some of it is labeled as inappropriate by parents, ensuring that diverse perspectives and educational resources remain accessible to all who seek them.
1463	4440	2	3	Imagine a world where nearly every other book is banned for some reason or another. That world is not a world I want to live in. I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong. For three reasons, really, the first being that people have the right to any information that they desire to have. The second, people do not have the power to take opportunities away from other people. The last point I will make is that no information is bad information. Because we are in Columbia, Missouri, I assume that we are talking about censorship in Columbia, Missouri libraries. If that is the case, then I think that it is unconstitutional to ban any book, or censor any material. Censoring books is like putting a blind fold on whoever is reading the material; they don't see it for what it really is, or for what the intended purpose is. If the prompt does happen to be including foreign countries, then I think humans do not have the right to influence what other people read. This is idealistic, yes, and in a perfect world, all countries would have equal rights for everyone, regardless of race or gender. I think that people should see everything the way it is. If something is offensive, it's offensive. It's the person's choice whether or not they read or listen. That leads me to my last point, that no information can be bad information. Whether it is profane, or offensive in any way, there is always some kind of meaning behind it. From rappers like XXXTENTACION and BROCKHAMPTON CITY MORGUE, who I've found all of their songs have meaning, whether it's personal, or they are trying to send a message out to the people. There are books like Maus for Jewish people, by Art Spiegelman, which has recently been banned by some school libraries because of graphic scenes. The people who banned the book fail to realize that the book is not about those scenes. There is a much deeper message about guilt and grief, and redemption beneath it. Another, more famous book that was banned from school libraries is The Catcher in the Rye in the United States, by J.D. Salinger, which is a coming of age story about a boy. In conclusion, I do not think it is right to ban books or music from libraries. No one has the right to. There is always meaning within. The way an author writes a story or a piece of music always has meaning; they made the conscious decision to write it that way for a reason. By banning books, they are taking people's chances to grow and expand their understanding of the world and themselves.
1464	4441	2	3	Censorship is very important, especially when you are referring to libraries. I believe that each individual person is entitled to an opinion. If a certain book, magazine, movie, etc., is offensive to one specific person or a wide variety of people, those individuals should consult an official who has authority and decides what goes on and off the shelves about what they think or feel about their choice of selection. In the world, there are many different types of minorities, racial groups, and also differences in political groups, such as Democrats and Republicans. Even though these separate groups are extremely different from one another, they all share one thing in common: a unique voice. No matter who believes what or who supports who, everyone will always have a difference in voice. Some people may feel that having particular material displayed on shelves of libraries is rather offensive to specific individuals. Whereas others like myself say, as said earlier, if you are to have a problem with something displayed, then you should contact someone who will listen to what you have to say. For example, I cannot express that I desire to have something removed from a library shelf just because I am the one who finds the material a concern. Not everything is decided by me. It would be incredibly rude to state that something is offensive to me might not be to someone else. Just because I don't approve of something gives me no right to purposely remove something from the shelf. That is all related to freedom of speech. However, yes, you do in fact have the right to say what bothers you, but you do not own the privilege of doing what you want at any time because you have opposed views. It is true to say that we all agree we do not want to see inappropriate material displayed on library shelves, especially for children’s sake; ergo, libraries should take major consideration of restricting specific areas of a library for adult views only. I know suggestive material might be a concern for one, so not allowing children of a certain age to see certain material would be a highly good idea for any worried officials, adults, and parents, ensuring that libraries remain a resource for everyone while respecting differing viewpoints and protecting children from potentially harmful content.
1465	4442	2	3	"A few months ago I was at the local library searching for the perfect book. After an hour of searching I decided on one. I was happy with my choice as I checked it out. As I anxiously started reading my book, I found language, drug abuse, and sexual content. As a teenager, I do not want or need to be exposed to any innapropriate material. No one should be exposed to that, and because of that experiance, I believe that censorship in libraries is a must. Due to sexual content, drug abuse, and vulgar language, one must be seventeen to purchase a ticket for a rated-R movie. I believe that since that is true for movies, it should also be true for books, magazines, and music. Vulgar literature is not necessary and innapropriate for any age. The world exposes certain literature to children, and then is shocked when they see children in jails, gangs, and other horrible situations. The world has set their standards too low, and the children of todays society are following after our footsteps. Author, Katherine Paterson once said, ""...if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right so does everyone else."" This quote shows the impact that people have on generations to come. Everyone has their own opinion and this is mine. As a daily newspaper reader, I could not quiet my voice any longer. I had to step-up and say something. I am apart of a generation that is being affected greatly by the world in a negative way. The first step to changing that is to set the standards high. Protect the future generations and censor what children are allowed to be exposed to. We must ensure that libraries prioritize age-appropriate content. Situations will become better when libraries choose to censor and remove offensive materials from shelves. If libraries censor materials, then next time I want to find the perfect book, I will."
1466	4443	2	3	Every individual has their own opinion on censorship. Some people believe that, in some instances, it is perfectly fine, but others disagree. I'm one person that thinks that, in some instances, things should be censored. Schools have the right to censor what is put in their libraries for their students to read, especially magazines. Some of the magazines out there have articles in them that aren't appropriate for school hours or even in the school building. Schools do not want something inappropriate on their shelves where students can see it. Censorship is even more understandable in elementary schools. Younger students' libraries should be monitored even more carefully. Younger kids, such as elementary age, don't really know what they should and shouldn't read. In public libraries, things are a little different. Parents can usually monitor what their kids check out. Most adults know to read the summary on the back of the book to know what is being checked out. If the summary is too vague, then they know to read a few pages inside the book. A couple of times, I've gone to the public library and I checked out a book that I thought was a suspense. When I got home and began reading it, it turned out I was wrong. The book was a romance book that I didn't care to read. So, I returned the book to the library. Most of the time you can read the synopsis on the back of the book, but that doesn't always reveal too much about the book. So, the best thing you can do is read a couple of pages out of the book before you check it out. Everyone has a right to their own opinion on censorship. I believe that in some instances things available to be checked out should be censored, particularly in settings like schools. In other instances, things should be left up to the adults and the parents to decide what they want to be allowed to checked out, as they are better equipped to make informed choices for themselves and their children.
1467	4444	2	3	well if one person has a right to something then it would only be fair for the other people to have a right for the same thing. That would be like having six kids in one room and for no reason at all just give three kids a cookie and not the other three that wouldn't be right now would it. So if one person owns that book then another person wants that same book then they would have every right to grab that book and there's really nothing you could say to them. I know how it feels not having the same right as everyone else like one time my teacher gave my friend a piece of gum for no reason at all and I was mad because I didn't get a piece; I thought if he got a piece of gum for no reason then the rest of us should get one for no reason. It just felt unfair that I was excluded from something that was given freely to someone else. Like I said you give a right to one person then you should give that right to another person; now I could understand if three people were involved in a fight and the third person was just standing there watching, they don't have the right to go to jail, but the two that were physically fighting then they have every right to sit in jail and think about the fight. Now the third guy that was watching, he don't have the right to keep any videos of the fight and he should get a ticket. It's about equal treatment under the law and in everyday situations.
1468	4445	2	3	WHAT DO I THINK? When I heard about the problems some libraries were having; I thought to myself, what is the big issue over censoring movies, disks, books, and magazines. I know that children should not be around vulgar language heard or read. Books that have pics that should not be acceptable for the eyes of our young children either.  The libraries should come up with a solution. I was thinking that if they want to, they could make rooms of books that are only for certain ages. When people take these books off the shelf to report it or put that book somewhere else away from their children, they make the people that works their jobs much harder. There should also be an adult with you if entering into the room. The adult must be 18 or older. If a child is found in there alone, the workers of the library will contact the child's parents as a first offense. The same thing goes for the second time your caught. The third time you are caught, you will get a phone call to your parents and banned from the library for 6 months.  If you live in a big city, you might have bigger better libraries. Some libraries have so many books, that you might have to get a cherry picker to reach them. I know I'm a little off topic now but it is part of what I'm going to talk about. There are massive libraries and small libraries. It's almost like the difference between pre-school and college. Now that is a big difference.  What I think the cities that have a bigger population should consist of two libraries side by side. The one on the left would be for toddlers ranging from 1-4. This library will be busy a lot. The library will consist of a day care so parents can look for a book in complete silence. The children at the ages of 5-10 will also be in the library on the left, but upstairs. They will have books made just for their age ranges. They will also be capable of watching t.v. or playing minor games that don't possess violence on the computer.  The library on the right will look like a duplicate of the one on the left but is completely different on the inside. The reason they would do that is so kids would not try to get in because it looks cooler than the other. Our children look up to us in lots of different ways. Some include copying our every move. So when they see what you watch, listen to, and even read; they might want to do that too.  Know what I think most of you have learned from this is how to keep your children safe. I don't mean like they are getting hurt or anything, but helps keep them growing up and not knowing about things they shouldn't at age 12. So, once again, I would like to let you know that we can fix this. We want to keep your children away from the bad things, and with careful consideration and these types of changes, we can make libraries a safe and beneficial place for children of all ages.
1469	4446	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves because I don't see how they are offensive to other people. Even if it's war movies, it's telling what these men have gone through, and they fought and lost their friends. You don't just see people killing and shooting; you see the emotions of the men, and it's emotional for you to see that. Every book in there should stay there because some people need it for a project or to study about that person, and a lot of books have lots of history that you can learn from. The only thing that I think should be removed is the music because if it's rap or anything like that, it should not be allowed in libraries; it brings hatred and often killing to the country, and that should not be allowed. Some magazines should be allowed, like racing, sports, or military, but all of the other bad stuff should stay out because if they do see the kind of stuff that shouldn't be seen, it will get into their mind; therefore, some materials are okay, but others should be removed to protect people. That's what I think about this whole idea.
1470	4447	2	3	There are all kinds of books, movies, and even magazines out there. Most libraries have a huge selection for all types of readers or people who would like to watch a movie. They could even have stuff that the young minds should not read. Have you ever thought about what would happen if a little kid grabbed onto something that he/she was not supposed to read? When it comes to things like this, there is a huge range of topics. Some of them are not supposed to be looked at until an older age. Thats why I think there should be a certain section where only a certain amount of ages are allowed to go. When it comes to books, there will always be some books that are not apporbiate for the young mind. They could include multiple things that could scar a kid for life. Some of the things that they might read are probably things that their parents would like to talk to them about later on in the future. Books are great for learning, dont get me wrong, but there are some that are more adult related. Now there are a ton of books that kids can read and parents won't need to worry about them reading. Another way libraries can help is put the movies in a certain section. The library could make a section called 'family and kids'. This section would hold a perfect spot where parents wouldn't have to worry about their kids getting the wrong ideas from movies. In our library, we have this section. My grandma and I would always go there and find an incredible family movie to watch together. Finding a great family movie to watch is the best feeling ever. Finally the last way a library could help is by making sure the child is old enough to check out a book or a movie. Clearly a child of 6 shouldn't check out a movie that is rated R, thats just wrong. Libraries should make sure the child is at the correct age to check out the movie. Thats why the movie companys rate movies, so they can give people heads up about whats good and bad about the movie. Also the libraries should make sure a kid is checking out the apporbiate type of magazine or book. The people that work there could look through it before and make sure its the right type of book they should read. There are an infinte amount of ways we can protect the minds of young ones. I dont think libraries should banned books, magazines, movies, or even music. I think they should just make sure the kids are checking out what their allowed to read. Books are a great way to learn things, but they should be learning about the stuff that is sustable for their age. Libraries are there for us to learn and enjoy ourselves. I believe people would get upset if they would banned the stuff they love. They should just keep an eye out of what kids are looking at, ensuring a safe and enriching environment for everyone. Thank you for your time.
1471	4448	2	3	The last thing I would want my children seeing in a LIBRARY is offensive material. A LIBRARY is thought of as a learning zone. Somewhere for people to learn about new things and expand their knowledge. If there are dirty magazines, movies on sexuality, offensive music or inappropriate websites available to children it completely defeats the purpose of having a safe learning environment. My opinion is that libraries should be used primarily for educational purposes. That means that there should be appropriate books and magazines that are also age appropriate. Computers are also a great resource but can contain many offensive material. My standpoint on this issue is that the computers in the LIBRARY should be monitored. If someone wants to look up inappropriate images and websites, then they should do it on their own time, in the privacy of their own home. It should not be allowed in public where innocent children will be exposed to it. That isn't fair to the kids, and it isn't fair to the parents who have tried to protect them from that kind of suggestive material. I'm sure that there are many people out there that would disagree with my proposal. However those MAY be the type of people who aren't morally structured as I, or those who don't have kids to look out for. Or perhaps they just aren't as concerned about the issue. They will argue that there is really no severe need for the computers to be monitored, or that they have blocked websites. Yes, they MAY think that there is no real harm. But that MAY just be because that is the way they were raised, causing them to think in that same respect. With the magazines, some MAY argue that children will be exposed to suggestive material sometime, so why not now? But if everyone were to start thinking like this all morals would be forgotten. In some cases morality might not be the issue at all. In fact, religion might be the most important issue. A lot of people are religious and their particular religion MAY be against looking at suggestive and 'unholy' material. Parents will not want to walk into a LIBRARY with their children and find them starting at images that go against what they believe in. They will think of it as losing their child's innocence. Having these things out in the open and accessible to kids and teenagers could unintentionally send a message to them that indulging in sexual activities is acceptable when according to their religion it is not. When I was a little girl I remember going to the LIBRARY often with my mother to pick out books for school. I distinctly remember seeing naughty magazines laying across a table as I was walking toward the children's section. My mother was appalled that they had those laying out in the open like that, and especially right next to where the children's books were. She complained to one of the librarians and asked that they please remove them. The librarian apologized and agreed that the placement of the magazines was a little out of line. Ever since then my mom has been a little skeptical and dreads going to that LIBRARY. I suppose that is why I am so involved in this issue and the reason for this informative article. I did not write this to place blame on anyone or to judge people for their beliefs. On the contrary, the purpose for my writing this was to inform general public of these issues and to explain my side of the argument. I don't see the reason of having these materials on hand at a LIBRARY where almost anyone has access to them. I do not understand the need for them to be obtainable at a LIBRARY, or if there is a need at all. I'm hoping that by reading this I have opened the eyes of some concerned parents out there, or have at least made them aware of the matter. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Concerned Parent
1472	4449	2	3	How would you like it if someone took a book away from you, just because it had offensive language or nasty meaning? I mean of course there are certain books that should be censored, but in doing so you exclude some great novels from the past. These novels were acceptable back then due to different societal norms. If you want to censor books do so in your own library. Personally, I don't believe in the censorship of books. If the author meant to write the book that way then the writing should stay that exact way. Censoring destroys books and the learning curriculum of multiple students. You would censor a school book if it had some graphic text between its covers.  There are tons of books that have bad language and perverse ideas. These books were penned to educate our civilization about different aspects of humanity, both good and bad. If you take away those books, then you will be harming our societies ability to learn and understand complex issues. Books, I believe should not be offensive unless your a self-conscious person. Reading a book is a delightful experience, it shouldn't be marred by censorships.  In my personal experience, I have had no problem reading an exquisite novel that has some minor graphic details. I do not care if there is an explicit word in my reading. Albeit, naive persons have it in their will to remove offensive articles, not for public good, but for personal gain or comfort. These offensive tactics are a disgrace to literature and culture. Most of the books written in today's world are far less explicit then before. Thus, we would be creating that unwanted barrier if we started censoring older works.  When the Nazis burned the Jewish books, we almost lost a whole civilizations culture and literature. This should never happen to today's literature. If we censor the books in our libraries, then we will be loosing a certain aspect of our culture and history. The censorship of the articles of reading in our libraries should be kept to personal libraries and only to personal libraries. The libraries are public for a reason: to allow access to a wide range of ideas and perspectives.  In conclusion, Censorship should not be placed in libraries because it disrupts the public literature and limits intellectual freedom. If the books were meant to be read that way, then so be it. We are not the destroyer of classic literature, and it should never come to that, as doing so would impoverish our understanding of the world and ourselves.
1473	4450	2	3	
1474	4451	2	3	In my opinion, books that some people find offensive should be kept on the shelf. Meaning that people should be allowed to check them out in the library and read them even if some people think those books in particular are offensive, or come off as offensive. A person should be able to read an article without feeling like someone wrote that book, article, or magazine to be offensive. Yes, but at the same time it is up to you, the reader, to pick a book that does and will not make you feel uncomfortable. Do not pick a book to read that discriminates against football players if you are a football player, because most likely it is going to upset you, or make you uncomfortable. Well say you want to read a book that discriminates against football players, and it does make you feel uncomfortable, do not take the book, and go complain to someone about how the book, or article makes you feel if you picked it out to begin with. If it makes you uncomfortable, put the book, or article down. No one is forcing you to read it or look at it.  People should be allowed to read whatever type of books they would like, and about anything that interests them. Just because an article, or book is offensive to you, does not mean it is offensive to other people. If we were to take all the books, articles, magazines off the shelfs of library's there would not be any books left for us to read because every book written offends at least one person.  Movies are a whole other issue in itself. There are many types of movies, and within those types of movies are types of things people do in the movies to make it funny, scary, shocking, stupid, etc. If you do not cuss and say you go watch 'SOUTH PARK' you are going to find it offensive because every other word they say is a cuss word. If you do not like how people jump out of strange places and scare the crap out of you, then you are not going to watch 'SCARY MOVIE.' Some people find movies offensive or not to their liking the usually go and try to make a big deal out of it, and sue the people who made the movie. You doing that is causing more trouble than it is actually worth. The same thing with movies as books, if we were to take all the movies out of movie stores, and just stores in general that were offensive to at least one person in any way, we would not have any movies left to watch because at the end of the day; there are tons of movies that would offend some people, and make them uncomfortable.  In conclusion, if you find a movie, song, book, article, or magazine that is offensive to you, get over it. Keep that book or whatever it is out of your reach and in other peoples, because at the end of the day no one is going to help you sue an author, producer, or music production company because something they wrote, directed, or sung offends you. In my opinion you should just read what interests you, watch what you like, and listen to the songs you usually listen to, and let others do the same without interference, as everyone has different tastes and sensitivities, and forcing conformity is neither practical nor desirable.
1475	4452	2	3	Should books, music, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves that are found offensive? Everyone has their own opinion on that question. In my years of reading I have read a few books that were questionable. I wouldn't say someone else couldn't relate to it. Personally, I don't think anything should be removed from the shelves. While growing up, our parents try to keep us from things that, at that point in life, we don't need to see. I can agree with age limits, but you can't hide everything. Isn't it best to let the children know what's out there before just letting them go to find out on their own?  You would probably get multiple answers to that question. My personal views @MONTH1 might be different from the person sitting beside me, but I think you should be able to have the right to read, see, and listen to what you want. The world is not a safe place; it's scary and mean to people. When I raise my children, when they're younger there will be certain things that they won't know and won't see. But that's just part of raising your kids; when they get older and start asking questions, I'm going to answer with the truth.  Is keeping these things from our children lying to them? I would have to say yes to that question. By taking these things away from the youth, we are telling them that it's not out there, that the world is perfect and there is no wrong. Some people would actually say that, but I have to say to them that they haven't lived. Still to this day, there is segregation to all people, not just against races but in our own race itself.  To conclude my opinion, I would have to say that we should be free to read and see what we want. We shouldn't keep anything from anyone and then let them out in the world and have a complete culture shock. Teach your children what's out there, let them know the truth about the world. Should certain materials be removed from shelves? No, @CAPS1 is to judge what we see and hear; censorship limits growth and understanding.
1476	4453	2	3	Children all around the world find themselves wandering through the library every day. These children are exploring the literature world to learn and grow. The library is a wonderful place with many genres of literature such as children books, nonfiction books, fiction books, adult books, movies, etc. There are certain genres for certain age groups, and there are a lot of materials in libraries that parents do not want their children to even hear the name. I think that it is normal for parents to feel this way but it is not necessary. Children should have the right to explore the literature world however they want. Reading different types of literature is a terrific way of learning and library shelves should not be stripped of the books occupying the space. There are many different types of books, movies, magazines, and music on the shelves in a library. These are all great forms of literature and a way of learning different things. Although, there are a lot of parents who do not want there children 'exposed' so such materials. If a child want's to read a book, let he or she read it for crying out loud! Parents might say that it is 'corrupting' their child but, books and music don't corrupt children, it's the environment and people around them that have said ability to cause such corruption. It is a very normal thing for a parent to be protective of his or her child, but to a certain extent. A parent is supposed to help their child grow and learn right from wrong. They have every right to protect their child from dangers in the world, but not to keep them from learning the art of literature. They're not supposed to shield their child from all the faults the world has, even if it is a book. Literature in every form is a great way of learning. Libraries shouldn't have to strip the shelves of wonderful books crated in the literature world for one's entertainment or learning. If a child want's to read a book they should have every right to read that book. They should be able to explore however they desire, because limiting their access only hinders their potential for growth and understanding.
1477	4454	2	3	Well people should be able to get whatever they want if they are an adult. Kids should not, but what can you do? It wouldn't be right to take away things that people like, as autonomy is important for adults and their personal choices, though safeguards are needed for minors. Ultimately, respecting individual preferences is a key component of a free society.
1478	4455	2	3	Libraries, they are everywhere and all together they contain millions of books that influence everyone who reads them. Whether a book is being read about Shakespeare or the Bible there is always something influential to be read. Some books have more adult themes or references to certain subjects which most adults find inappropriate for readers of certain ages. The question is, is it a good idea for those books that are now being censored to be taken off the shelves? In personal opinion; yes those types of books are influential, yes it is possible that it could negatively effect the youth of 2024, but everyone has the right to read what interests them. Being influential is one of the main priorities of most reading materials. There is a point to be proven or a side story to be shared within most books. Is this a bad thing? Is it 'bad' to explain a point of view or to explain a life experience? No, having experiences is only half the point of living; sharing it is the rest. The Red Cross explains one of the more major downfalls in America and how it brutally effected the people struggling for life and money. Twilight shows the softer side of love and that anyone can be happy if they set their hearts on someone. These are not only experiences but things to ponder upon, and losing these factors in life would be a horrible mistake. The youth of 2024 is portrayed in mostly a negative light. Whether they are considered monsters or maybe even the devils offspring; our youth need influences. Reading is one of the major sources of inspiration for students to grow and prosper. Most students find reading to be boring. In school you are not offered what you want to read. Lists are made, and guidelines are created so that only certain things are read and taught. Young adults need creativity and books are there to shine a light on their eager minds. Taking away the books students and young adults are interested in is one of the many growing problems contributing to people not wanting to read. Teachers, principals, business men, and even children deserve the right to reading what they like. If you were a sports major and suddenly the population decided sports journals and sports themselves were too harmful and badly influential to people; what would you do when suddenly everything sports related was taken away? You would lose your career. Romance novelists use sensual or even sexual experiences to convey something everyone has trembling inside their minds. Taking away something that is related to something so natural in every day life would have severe reprocussions; especially for those who greatly enjoy those books. Revoking the rights to the literary works of thousands of authors would also take away an intellectual culture that is conveyed. Influencing people to think about things that are viewed by everyone is not a bad thing when it can be used to inspire people in their lives. Just because someone is a student or a child doesn't mean that a literary work could rot their mind. Taking away something that can contribute to the every day art of life would slowly create a less creative, inventive, and inspired world. Not everyone believes that certain books are bad, and i, am one of those thousands of people.
1479	4456	2	3	Should materials such as books, music, movies, magazines and etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Should these magazines and etc., be put up in a place for that age group? Should these type of things be put in the **LIBRARY** with children? Should they be in the **LIBRARY'S** period?  I think that the **LIBRARY** should have all type of books in there because that's what a **LIBRARY** is for. But I do think that if people are finding it offensive to have these type of books open to children they should ask the **LIBRARY** to change how they have the books displayed. But I also think the **LIBRARY** should put these books up in a part where they have adult things and books at, because these type of book isn't made for children eyes.  The **LIBRARY** should put people ages on the **LIBRARY** cards so that this won't be a problem to the people or the **LIBRARY**. Because then you would know how old they are, and only **18** years of age can see the books and magazines, etc., that isn't right for young children eyes. But I do think that it is offensive to people that have young children and their children are reading it, and it is offensive to the people that just don't like what the book, music and magazines stand for.  One thing I don't agree on is that books should be taken off the shelves because there are some people that comes to the **LIBRARY** just to read these books. And the people who read these books are going to be upset that you took the books off the shelves, because me personally I like the magazines, books, music and the movies and I don't find nothing offensive about them. And I like the movies too because it gives me something to do and watch when I am at home.  I also think that the movies and music is something we all love that's in the **LIBRARY**, because it give me and my friends something to do after school. So if you take away the thing we like what will we have to do after school when we go to the **LIBRARY**. And the thing's that was named make the **LIBRARY** so fun an peaceful. The **LIBRARY** is a place were you can come and whine your day down, and without them thing there trying to take of the shelves it's going to be boring. People who don't have nothing to do doing the day come to the **LIBRARY** and look for that offensive stuff, so removing materials entirely isn't the answer, but rather a thoughtful approach to placement and access is needed to balance diverse needs.
1480	4457	2	3	Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. People should have the choice to read or watch whatever they want to. Just because one person finds a book offensive doesn't mean that another person will also find it offensive. The library's need to let the community deem what they find offensive or not. Some parents say that they do not want bad or certain materials in the library because their children might read it. If parents are that concerned about what their children see, then they should sit down with their child and discuss why they should not be able to read or watch that type of material. Parents should be able to make their children understand why they shouldn't read or watch the certain material instead of accusing the library's themselves just for having the material. If some books or movies are deemed very offensive by public, then they should be placed in a special area. This special area should be clearly marked with a sign that says 'Mature content' and should only be able to be viewed by adults. This would solve many problems such as children being able to check out certain materials, as those materials could be restricted. Doing this would grant the people who wish to see this type of material access to the material. This would also solve a problem because it would be in a back corner or area that not many people go to so children will not very easily see it. The best solution to this problem would still allow the library's to put certain material that are found offensive in their library's, ensuring access to diverse viewpoints. But instead put age restrictions to being able to check out the material and also putting it in a different section of the library than the normal material, allowing responsible access and parental guidance to shape children’s choices.
1481	4458	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I understand that some parents wouldn't want their kids reading a book about drugs or watching a movie about gangs, but libraries shouldn't have to remove them from their shelves. There is not one movie, book, or magazine where everyone will approve of it. Just because a couple of people find it offensive doesn't mean they should have the power to determine what materials libraries have or don't have on their shelves. One reason why I believe certain items shouldn't be removed from a library just because a couple of people find it offensive is because what Katherine Paterson said in her quote. She is saying if there was a book a couple of parents didn't want their kids to see and they were to complain and have the right to remove it from the libraries shelf. Then sooner or later, more and more parents will be coming in complaining about a different book, movie, or magazine every other day. Soon, there wouldn't be any books, movies, magazines in the library. Another reason why I believe we should have no say in what items libraries hold is this. As you know, there is many different cultural familes living in the @LOCATION1. Some people say bibles should be allowed in libraries. Half the population agrees on that statement, the other half thinks that is ridiculous and they're thinking how they would even suggest doing such a thing. How would a library handle this situation. If we gave people the right to decide what was held in libraries. There would be a group of people walking in there and saying they don't believe in @CAPS1 so they must take those bibles off the shelf before their children read it. Then, as soon as the believers in @CAPS1 hear about it. They would come to that library and complain about them actually taking that off the shelves. There would be no way in pleasing everyone, so the libraries should be able to put whatever they want on their shelves. My third and final reason why I think the public should have no say in this matter is if libraries were forced to take items off their shelves just because a couple people complain about certain books or movies. Then why couldn't people do that at restaurants, or movie rental business, or outlet stores with clothes they don't approve. If it was to happen to one business, then it should happen to every business and in my perspective. The only person who should have the say in what they have in their store/library is the person who is paying for it and that is the owner. It's their responsibility to know what's too far concerning movies or books, etc. The public has to accept those choices. You have to look at it from their view. Would you want them to come into your business and start complaining and then you are forced to get rid of that item because of them. It's just not the right way to handle things. After reading all those opinions of mine, I would hope that you see where I'm coming from and you see that it just wouldn't be humane to do that. It's never been that way and it should never be that way. Obviously parents don't want their kids to see things inappropiate. But it's not our say and we just have to face the fact that's the way it should be, respecting the autonomy and judgment of those who curate these collections.
1482	4459	2	3	Today, we live in a world where there are many different political, religious and personal views; and with time, these views are only going to become more varied and more wide spread. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to cater to every single persons individual takes on the world. When it comes to libraries, it is even harder to have different books for all the different opinions that will not offend people with other opinions. Let's take @LOCATION1, for example. There are many different races and people with different religions living here. This is a place that has already been through a @CAPS1 civil war @CAPS2 and has fought against racism and slavery. Although these are things that our country has overcome, there are still going to be arguments and disagreements over these problems. When there are different opinions, there are always going to be different books out there about the same topic from multiple points of view. As the readers of these books we need to know what point of view this is coming from and not choose a book that goes against our personal beliefs. This is where the offensiveness comes from. We live with many different people and we need to understand that not everyone is going to have the same views on life that we do. When I was in eighth grade, I was @CAPS6 hanging out @ORGANIZATION1 a restaurant with some friends. One of them was pulling her eyes back (like someone would do if they were imitating an @CAPS3 Asian person) because they were itchy. A very pregnant @CAPS3 Asian @CAPS5 woman walked in and took offense to my friends eye movements. She yelled @CAPS6 at us and said, 'I would have thought your parents raised you better than that.' @CAPS6 At first, we did not understand what this woman was talking about until we realized that our friend had been pulling her eyes back. This showed us that different people can take offense to different things because of their heritage. There is nothing we can do about the expanding cultures in our country. We cannot change the views of certain people in order to match those of our own beliefs nor can we change the fact that all the different people are going to voice their opinions and view them as 'right'. However, we can change the way that we view these people. We need to understand that there is no 'right' when you are dealing with multiple opinions. @CAPS6 At this point we need to embrace everyone else for who they are and what they believe because there is nothing we can do to change those beliefs. So next time you pick up a book @CAPS6 from the library, read the summary and check to see that the author agrees with you before you take the book home or there are going to be disagreements in your views. If you get a book and you don't agree with it or if you are offended by it, there is no one to be mad @CAPS6 at but yourself for not checking to see the author's stance on the topic before you started reading it, so be mindful of the viewpoints presented in the material you choose.
1483	4460	2	3	I strongly feel that every book was created for people to read and gain knowledge, on what every aspect of what the book is. If your children are looking at things they should not be looking at, you should keep you child away from that section. Every person has a different style of book's that they like to read, they should not have to lose those book's because children are looking at things their not supose to. What would be the point in a library if you can not have certain materials in side it. My view on censorship in libraries would have to be that those bad sections should be off limits to childeren. All libraries are divided up in to different sections like; fiction, non- fiction, fantasy, children's books. Those sections were created for a reason. If people choose to let their children read books then that is fine with me. Although those parents that do not approve of this can go to a different library. I feel that if that one parent complains and no one else has that they should not be allowed in that library anymore. I do not beleive that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc should be excluded from a library. Just because, a person does not appreciate their child picking up a book they should not have. I feel that parents should be responsiable for what their kid's are looking at, and not make libraries take books off their shelves. Everything from books to movies were put in the libraries for educational reasons. Their should be laws that say those things are put into a library for a certain reason, and if customers do not like that they can go some where's else. My own experience being a volunteer at a local library is that there are many things that were put into a libray for a reason. Every movie, book, and magazine have information about something that you want to know. Books are put in libraries for people's pleasure and love for reading. All those types of books are made from people that find excitement in reading. Movies at a library are put their for educational reason like: to teach kids to count, and to learn something about a certain topic. Magazines could just be in a library for people to read and relax, and learn something new in the world. I really feel that parent's should watch what their children are reading, you should think the same. Library's should not have to remove books from their shelves that have been there for a really long time. Materials like movies, books, magazines, and music should never be taken away from a library. What would be the point in having a library around if you could not go check a book , movie or cd out that interest's you. After reading this you should feel the same, that certain thing should not be removed from a library because parent's do not know how to watch their children. Ultimately, libraries are vital resources that should offer a wide range of materials for everyone, and parental responsibility is key to ensuring children access age-appropriate content.
1484	4461	2	3	Have you ever seen a book or magazine on a shelf that looked offensive? Say, maybe some sort of book that highly deals with drugs, alcohol or even sex? Well, some parents don't want their kids to 'accidently' pick up this book and read it. It could scar them mentally for life. Offensive books are not meant for kids or even some kids in the early teens. They are too young to learn about drugs, alcohol and/or sex. If a kid picks up a book about sex, which I highly doubt would be on a library shelf, what would they say to their parents? 'Mom, look what I found' is exactly what the kid would say and show the book to their parent. The parent, in shock, could sue the library for having such an offensive book. However, some adults do not find books like that on library shelves offensive. It might 'provide' good information for their lives or even someone else's life. Adults are the ones who should be reading those kinds of books, not their children. It can and will mentally scar them for life. The library could do simple things, like for example: they could make a room just for adults and have the offensive movies/books/magazines, ect in there. Kids can't enter unless they are 18 or older. That could be a good idea because their children wouldn't be picking up those kinds of offensive books and it will keep their mind safer. Us children are always curious to know things, especially when we are growing up. We'll ask about drugs, alcohol and even sex when the time is right. But for the library to have things like that on their shelves is just very offensive to parents and other adults. The library staff should take action and make a separate room for adults elsewhere. This would provide a more suitable environment and help ensure that younger children are not exposed to potentially harmful material.
1485	4462	2	3	I believe censorship is necessary. If all of the kids in the world grew up listening to hardcore gangster rap and watching porn 2024 we would have shiftless and violent leaders tomorrow. It's inmportant that we are held back some what by these offensive outlets in order that we grow into mentally healthy adults. However, censorship can go to far. When it comes to the removing an author's work from a public library altogether, we have crossed the line. With the FREEDOM given us by our founding fathers, our FREEDOM given to us at birth, and the duty we have to express our opinion, I submit that it is a crime to remove the hardwork of authors and artists from the shelves. Of course the first point of argument that comes to mind to defend my postion is the fact that we are all given a legal right to express oursleves through the 1st amendment of our CONSTITUTION of FREEDOM. The writers of this CONSTITUTION were aware that freedom of creativity should not be held back from the people. That law still exists 2024 and has been used many times to defend people arguing to keep their work, their words, and their ideas out in the world. As far as I know, taking any form of media, book, or entertainment away from the general public would be illegal. Still, even with this point made, some may not be convinced that we are allowed to say what we want. A man by the name of Frank Zappa comes to my mind when asked about censorship in the media. Frank Zappa was a musician, composer, writer, public speaker, and human RIGHTS activist. I think many people believe him to be a bit too wild and deranged to be a convincing argument. Frank Zappa was known to be a firm athiest and secular humanist (one who believes that there is nothing more important than the physical human body), but he gave the same argument I'm giving 2024, and I'm a catholic. Frank Zappa spoke out against censorship, saying that it was a way to judge artists on their work when it wasn't even listened to fully. If someone as convincing and passionate as Frank Zappa could feel that way when he didn't even believe in a GOD, then everyone should see that the human race, whether they believe in a GOD or not, is given the right for their creation to be revealed. In some cases, it's necessary and needed for people to show their ideas to the public. Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Nelson Mandela even, and the list goes on. These people, although from different worlds and different times and different people, were all avid believers in the FREEDOM of humans. Imagine if Martin Luther King Jr. had just said, 'I don't think people want to hear me so I'll just stop and let someone else take over for a little bit.' Do you think the world would by as amazing and of intergrated as a place? The point is, we never know how great and life-changing someone's point of view could be. Whether it's leading a civil RIGHTS movement, or attempting to bring peace to a world that needs it the most, censorship might be the one thing from stopping the people from seeing the most influential person that they need. In fact, we are all called to share our ideas. It's our duty to make sure people see the world not only from their view, but from the view of a poor homeless man, and from a single mother of five, and from a kid in elementary school, and from a rebellious teenager. The world might not be ready for change, but it needs it. Who's right is it to judge an artist's work? Some call him GOD, some call him the man, and others call him the government. It's hard getting your work acknowledged by someone, let alone a whole nation. However, that doesn't mean we are to just give up. Censorship in public places is a crime against the law, nature, and our inaliable FREEDOM, and it's our job to go out into the world to create a new one, ensuring that diverse voices are heard and that the pursuit of knowledge remains unhindered.
1486	4463	2	3	Censorship is just another way to take knowledge from another person or a society. Wanting to take and hide even the smallest of discreet history, politic corruption, and inappropriate sights to a generation can turn them all ignorant and unaware of their past, present, and possibly future. Censorship is extremely dangerous to a society because it leaves them vulnerable to the future. For example, if people tried to censor environmentalists like @CAPS1 Greta Thunberg, @CAPS2 David Suzuki, and many other environmentalists around the globe of the @CAPS3 climate change @CAPS4 crisis possibility, then the world would not be able to have the chance to stop or at least slow the upcoming disaster by going green. Instead, we would most likely die a few hundred years before that deadline. Also, maybe if more people knew about @PERSON2 George W. Bush's censorship of his oil distribution among the @LOCATION2 Middle East (during his presidency) people might have at least discussed impeachment. Try to think how the future would have been if racism, terrorism, wars, or even an event like the holocaust were censored. That could be taken as brainwashing! Even though that @MONTH1 December cause peace and happiness around the world, we still would know nothing of our history leaving us historically, unintellectual. Then think of all the sudden problem it would cause if that information was suddenly found. In the book series of 'The @CAPS5 Giver' by @PERSON1 Lois Lowry, a city has been isolated from their past, who they call 'the @CAPS6 memories', and they are basically brainwashed to think that they almost destroyed the world by war and destruction by the new government and their new technology. Luckily, in our own era I do not believe we are censored from most things except of course politics going on between other countries. For example, the @LOCATION1 Pakistan bin @CAPS7 Laden killing was nothing of anyones awareness except the @CAPS8 agents of @ORGANIZATION1 CIA, military, and @CAPS9 officials. That was a thoughtful choice from @CAPS10 Obama as well instead of announcing it on @NUM1 national news. I'd rather of course be notified about my history, because it's interesting and it shows why things are now. Books like 'To @CAPS11 Kill a @CAPS12 Mockingbird' or '@PERSON3 Shakespeare' should never be taken off shelves for young pupils or old matures. Although it would seem a bit more offensive to hearing a historical racist cocasian singing about negroes than a racist book, I would always be interested in hearing about it. Censorship should definitely be illegal itself in libraries, @CAPS13 music stores, and any other selling stores of books, music, movies, and/or magazines. Although, I have not heard of any recent censorships, but then again should I not be able to? It is censorship. Therefore, open access to information is paramount to an informed and empowered society, and any attempts to suppress knowledge should be met with resistance.
1487	4464	2	3	Dear Katherine Paterson, I was thinking about if the items you listed to be offensive, well I believe that it's a free country and that all people should be treated equal. What I'm trying to get to is that the newspaper organization should keep doing what they do! In fact, should add more. Yes, there should be restrictions on some things, but to solve the underage buying, just make people use their CAPS1 ID! By doing this, I think this would solve a lot of issues; taking it all away would be a little too serious for just some magazines or movies. So, keep doing what you're doing, just set a higher restriction on sales, and things should be just fine. Overall, maintaining freedom of expression while implementing stronger age verification seems like the best approach. From your dearly, Zack
1488	4465	2	3	This writing is socially unacceptable! There are many books and media sources, that include: language, sexual tones, and other immoral things and ideas. However culture does need to be obtained, although immorality on this earth is at an all-time high, we need to stop focusing on books that will always be on the shelves and turn our attention to people's hearts, and turn to morally right things. When a person walks into a library, he or she can expect certain things, for example: the smell of the older books, the noise of a group of kids, and the yelling of the librarian to keep them quiet. What he or she would not expect is: kids doing drugs, and watching porn on the computers. This is not a book's fault or 'the evil computers' fault. This is the fault of an immoral world. I myself have witnessed some evil things kids do in the school system and it gets worst everyday, there is good, but it certainly is not because they themselves are caring and loving about what they do on this planet. I can quote from many, in my 8th grade class that have told me 'The only thing that is wrong, is telling someone they are'. This thought process is immoral. But who is going to tell them that, and what is the answer. Jesus is the answer, in the Bible it says, Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. This is truth. In the book of Romans it says, God gave many people over to their sinful passions. God is the only good, and the only light comes from God. The only man to live a perfect life was Jesus; God was God in a human body. We as a planet need to turn to God, the only good thing. And try to be like God, because this world needs God. Only God can change a heart. We need the focus on God, once we do that, the way we think, and the way we write, and the way we act, will change and we will not need to discuss this problem any longer.
1489	4466	2	3	I think that only if there is real offensive stuff then it should be censored. It is wrong to make fun of or joke about people. Mocking a disability, like there have been movies made doing, is unacceptable. Well actually, there is a movie I've seen before called The Ringer, and it's about a guy that made fun of a Special Olympics team, then lied about having a disability to get money for racing and beating the team in races when he was totally fine. That would be something that I myself would want to take off shelves because there is no reason to mock a disability. I wouldn't know who decides what goes on shelves and what does not, so maybe depending on what the offensive information is, that context tells them something shouldn't be brought out for public consumption, as some content is simply too insensitive and harmful.
1490	4467	2	3	I @CAPS1'@CAPS2 believe that any kind of material such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be censored except for mature content such as pornography, violent and horrid movies and video games. But that's why we have @ORGANIZATION1's made, organizations that can help determine appropriate content. So when asked, we can show our age to access certain materials. Some age groups react differently to mature contents. Usually @NUM1 and up is a tolerable level for maturity to set in. Maturity is maintained at different paces in all age groups. For example, perhaps a @NUM2 year old is more mature than an @NUM3 year old. It is when you as an individual can act like a human being, instead of like a pack of rabid wolves. Just because you do not act mature doesn'@CAPS2 mean you don't know how to be civilized. The best way to prevent a child from discovering something inappropriate or vulgar is to separate the books by an age grouping system. Keep adult videos out of sight and reach of children. Also put safety locks on your @CAPS2.V. to prevent kids from sneaking behind your back. By implementing these strategies, we can better guide children's exposure to content and foster responsible behavior.
1491	4468	2	3	Everyone has an opinion. Don't you agree? That's what makes us different, this is why some of us would rather watch @CAPS1 compared to @CAPS2, or why some want to listen to pop instead of country. A library is a place that brings all sorts of people together. It's a place of interest and information, a place for research and enjoyment. So here is my question: 'Do we really want to remove certain materials from library shelves just because some people find them offensive?' I don't believe so, as the quote says by the author, Katherine Paterson, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I agree with that statement! Think about this, if we allowed people to get rid of the library books they just don't like, if everyone had that right. We would have no more books, no materials left to study or pleasure read. I have to admit I've seen things that I don't necessarily agree with, but other people might find value in them. You can't just have a library all to yourself, catering to just your interests and nobody elses. That's not what a library is for; millions of people use libraries for different purposes. So no I really don't think we should remove items from the shelves. Only pick up what you find interresting and leave it at that. We all have rights just like we all have likes, dislikes, and minds of our own. Opinions define us, choices shape us, but libraries do so much more; they advance our knowledge, make our dreams a reality, and sometimes even broaden our horizons. We need books, music, movies, and even magazines, but we need them all together. That's my position on this topic, I hope this helped form yours. It is vital that we protect the diversity of thought and expression found within libraries for the benefit of all.
1492	4469	2	3	Books in libraries are available to everyone, so who's job is it to decide which ones are appropriate and which are not? This is a very controversial topic. On one side, parents are worried about what their children have access to at local libraries. They believe libraries shouldn't contain any books that might be found offensive. On the other hand, whose job is it to decide what is offensive and what is not? If people are given the right to remove books that they think are not appropriate, eventually libraries will have so few books that it would be worthless to even get a library card. I believe that it is the job of parents and other adults to teach a child morals and what is right and wrong. If kids have developed morals and values, parents wouldn't have to worry so much about what they're checking out of the local library. Kids are faced with issues of right and wrong everyday, and parents should learn to trust that their child is making the right decision. As a teenager, I know that people have access to far worse things on the internet than in libraries. If people begin to censor libraries, surely they will begin to censor the internet, and the idea of freedom of speech will be thrown out the window. People have a right to be heard and share their opinions, and who has the right to say that a person's opinion doesn't matter? In my opinion, the act of removing books from a library says just that. Just a few months ago I had to write a research paper about the Holocaust, and in order to find information about the topic, I had to check out books from the library. Some of the information I read about the topic was horrible and very offensive, but I couldn't have written my paper without it. Books in libraries have information that is vital, whether the books are offensive or not. Books can be used to teach people lessons on what is right or wrong. By being educated about even the most offensive things, people can learn from them and form their beliefs. Removing offensive books from libraries will not lessen the chance that someone's child will run across the information that they contain. There are many sources for information, offensive or not, and a library is just one of them. People are responsible for their decisions, and it is each individual's choice on what they choose to read, watch, or listen to. We are faced with choices everyday. Should we watch a movie even though we know it's inappropriate? Should we listen to a song even though it gives off a bad message? Checking out a book from the library requires the same decision. Each person must choose what is right, and it is not our job to tell others what they can and can't do; ultimately, censorship in libraries is a dangerous path that undermines personal responsibility and freedom of thought.
1493	4470	2	3	Yes I do believe that any book found offensive to any person should be removed from the book shelf. You have to think about it from the other person's perspective, or put yourself in their shoes. Say you went to the library and that certain thing was constantly there or it felt like it was constantly hanging over your head, that would be a tough problem to deal with in your every day visit to the library. Also in your everyday life. One reason for this is because if you find a book on a shelf and it offends you and another person knows it affends you then most likely they will use it against you to say mean and harsh things, potentially leading to bullying or harassment. Another reason i believe an offensive book should be removed from the shelf is because what if you are in that place very often. I mean if you have to see that book every day dont you think that would start to get on your nerves a little bit. So what I am trying to say is I do beleive if there is an offensive book on a shelf remove it. Music should not be as much of an issue as books. Music is something you listen to or you hear. Books are things you read. I say music should not be as big of an issue because music you do not see like you do books, as the offensive content might be fleeting. Books is usally says it right there in black and white. Also the posibality of it being right there in front of you in words and a picture, making the offense more direct and unavoidable. So what I am saying here is that if you find something offensive then fix it instead of letting it bother you every day of you life. So get it fixed now or just get over what ever you find offensive, because constant exposure to something offensive can be detrimental to one's well-being.
1494	4471	2	3	"Books are pieces of art. Authors are artists. Writing is a form of expression. In the United States Constitution it grants freedom of expression. I do not think we should deny anyone that freedom. I do not believe books or any other form of art should be removed from the shelves of libraries. I understand that parents do not want their children seeing or hearing certain things. People want to keep children naive, they want them to stay innocent. The thing they have to understand is that children need to grow up. They will be curious. They will want to know. They will want to see the world. You can not hide things from them. I believe in what Maynard James Keenan, my favorite musician, once said ""censoring/covering your childrens eyes…"". The world can be a bad place and you want to protect them from that, but it can also be beautiful. There is so much that children, and just normal people would miss out on if we took down every thing that someone said was 'offensive'. Also there is the question of, what is offensive? Who decides? Where do we draw the line? Like Katherine Paterson said, soon we would have no books left on our shelves, because everyone has a different opinion. People can find the most innocent things offensive. If you do not want your children reading or hearing certain things, then tell them so. Do not ruin it for other people. To each his own. Different people like different things. Something that would be offensive to you could very well be beautiful to someone else. ""One man's trash is another man's treasure."" Books, music, movies, they are all art. People have the right to express themselves. We already censor so much. I think when you censor things it takes away from the original. If you do not particularly like something, then it is your choice to not read it. It is your choice to not listen to it. You can choose for your children, but you can not choose for others. People have a right to do what they want. People have a right to do what makes them happy. They have a right to read, watch, or listen to what makes them happy. They have a right to create what makes them happy. You have no right to take that away from someone. Books do not kill people. Music does not kill people. They can make you uncomfortable. They can even make you sick or angry, but they do not harm anyone. People make decisions. People control their own actions. Books, videos, art, does not harm people. All in all, I do not believe any books, music, movies, or any other forms of art should be removed from the shelves. There could be age limits for certain things, or specific sections for more adult things, but I do not believe any individual should have the choice to decide what is right for someone else. You can shelter your children if you would like. You can avoid things you find offensive. But please do not take away an opportunity for another, as a wonderful book, or a life-changing piece of music could be taken away from someone because you found it 'offensive,' and that would be a great loss."
1495	4472	2	3	Books are part of history no book should be censored. They show and teach us about history. If the book is based on true events nothing should be censored. Many books from the 1900's and earlier have words that younger children should not see yet. With how the human race is everyone is going to hear something bad or even see something. Its just like saying all websites should be cenerosed. A book that needs to be censored should not be in an elementary school. I would have to say any book that teaches a lesson or helps a teacher should be used no matter the content in it. This is why a teacher needs to read the book before assigning it the students. If he/she thinks the students will not act apporiate, then the book should not be used in the class room. A lot of books would be removed or cenersored from shelves. If you do not want to hear those words or see certain images you should not have gotten that book. Many people would be made mad if this did happen. I would be two because sometimes a whole chapter could be bad or in music a whole lyric could be bad. Many people are mad now, but everyone else would be mad if censerorship happened; ultimately, censorship would anger more people than it appeases.
1496	4473	2	3	Removing books off of shelves in our public library? To me, that sounds crazy. I can see how some people might be offended by some books, music, movies, magazines, etc., but some people appreciate it. It's diversity, some people love the down-to-earth literature, but some people can't handle it. Why take away something that only a few people disagree with? I believe some of the best entertainment in libraries are the most offensive, but it is all fact. I mean, if this is such a problem there should be a certain section to find those things in. If people want to complain then they can get out of that section, because people like me will be in that section ready to learn about all these different varieties of entertainment. Whether if it's offensive or not. People this month find some of it offensive, but I believe it makes that person stronger. It helps them realize how lucky they are that they're not being treated a certain way in the offensive book they're reading. It's just a piece of entertainment! If it offends you and you're not entertained, go find something that does! Even though I hear of people reading offensive books I've never really seen one myself. I think some people just get offended too easily. That's where we should reason with them instead of giving into their demands. So what if they aren't taken off the shelves? Like I said, we can make a certain section for them type of things. If they aren't happy with the outcome, they will get over it. Now that you read what I had to say, what do you think? Do you think we should remove certain entertainment off of library book shelves? Or should we just reason with the people who are offended? With dedicated sections and open dialogue, we can cater to diverse tastes and promote understanding, ultimately fostering a library environment that respects both individual sensitivities and intellectual freedom. I hope what you read today helps keep books on the shelves and readers happy!
1497	4474	2	3	Should we have censorship in our libraries? This is a question that both sides can argue with creditable facts. However, censorship is mostly defined as not allowing certain items or things to be seen or heard of until a mature age. How can you tell when someone is of a mature age? Maturity lies behind one's self to cope with various thoughts, ideas, actions, etc. Censorship should be allowed to an extent.  Censorship plays a big role in society today. It has changed the content on our television from 50 years ago to modern day. The government is more lenient today then they were 50 years ago. On television 50 years ago, you would never hear a swear word, or see a couple sleep in the same bed. Now, some swear words are considered okay, because people can handle them. It is like they are part of our daily vocabulary now. Censorship has changed a lot.  Books of all sorts should be allowed to children and adults of all ages. Certain literature provides a cornucopia of topics and subjects to be helpful to a processing brain. We learn and understand at different rates. Some books with 'adult content' may be suitable for more intelligent minds. Authors sometimes put in so-called 'adult content' to add suspense and drama towards the bigger picture or message behind their work. Books help the mind to expand and gain a higher standard of learning.  Movies are different. Some movies have sexual content that our youth should not see. Most magazines have the same principles as movies do. They are both rated differently on levels of age. Therefore, we can protect their innocence and fellow youth. Music is healthy to the mood of a person. Music should not be censored. People just have different tastes in music. Some may be fond of other genres and some may dislike the other genres. There is a wide array of music that people can enjoy. There is no way to censor the universal language that music provides.  Censorship should come down to what the adult allows for the kid to see and hear. Censorship of books is not fine, but censorship of movies and magazines are acceptable. Music, however, can not be censored. The lyrics and sounds speak to many people in strange ways. It is all helpful in the end. Everyone should have the right to watch, read, or listen to whatever they want. It all comes down to learning, and there is no censorship on learning. So, please do not censor our libraries, as we must allow adults to decide what is appropriate within their own families, and encourage open access to literature for all ages.
1498	4475	2	3	"I don't think people should remove books, movies, and music because it's the people's choice to read, listen to, and watch what they want. Why should things be changed because other people can't handle the content? If people want to read, watch, or listen to ""bad"" stuff, they should be able to; it's not other people's choice to decide for them. People will choose what they want or what they think they want to read, watch, or listen to, exploring different genres and themes. They will find out by themselves what they want to hear or listen to based on their own experiences and preferences. Like I said, it's the people who choose what they want to watch, listen to, or read, and it is nobody else's choice to say so. People will also figure out what they want their kids to read, listen to, and watch, making informed decisions for their families. Ultimately, it will be up to the individual to choose what they want to experience."
1499	4476	2	3	I feel that a person has the right to go to a library and get a book, magazine, movie, and whatever else they might because someone could use the material for information they might need. I however do feel that it should be handled maturely, kept in a special area or somewhere a child or person that should not have material about anything unuseful to them cannot easily access it. I think if it is something for an adult only then there should be no way of a child getting ahold of it. A person does have a right i feel to go to the library and get whatever book they might need for personal information to help themself or for a research paper they need information on. Anything inappropriate should have its own spot away from anything else. As I have mentioned I do feel that there should be some protection for children number one, who do not need to be reading about something over their head, and two for someone who doesn't really need that information to help them get information about something. I think there are many things that can help prevent someone from feeling like the library needs censorship; number one would be to have a special room just for things that are deemed inappropriate to someone, which leads me to my next point: there should be a worker just for determining if something should be kept in a special room. I think there definitely should be a certain age to enter a room for uncensored materials. If they do not meet the requirements, don't let them in. I do think in some cases then they should have to say why they want that certain material just to determine it is for all the right reasons. As I have mentioned I do feel that everything should be allowed because it could be needed by someone for personal information, or a classroom prompt that needs information. But I also do feel that there should be some rules and requirements as to what is appropriate and what is not, and if that person has a legitimate reason for needing something I don't see the harm of them getting what they need.
1500	4477	2	3	How would you feel if someone told you that you couldn't have certain food in your fridge that since its bad for your health or they might think it taste bad. You would not be too happy about it. Well its the same thing when people want to censor the libraries. When people try to censor the libraries they try to take out books that are 'offensive'. If someone that likes those kind of books and they are being taken off. Its unfair for that person because they are being limited on what they can get from the libaries. Libaries are soppose to be a place where you can get books or magazines that you like to enjoy but they cant do that because people are trying to cencor the books. The people that want to cencor certain books say that they might offensive not only to them but they could also for the kids. Well I say to that, you don't have to bring your kids to that section. You don't have to read those books you can just leave them alone for the people that like reading them. To the people that want to cencor certain books what makes a book offencsive? Whos to say if that is offensive or not? The two views are differnt just because one person thinks its offensive doesnt mean another person thinks the same. My opinion is leave the books there and let people enjoy the books they like to read. No book is bad every book does good for you because it builds your education, it could also be a stress reliever, and something you like to do on your free time. The people that are getting cheated out on the books they like because they are being cencored. What if the Harry Potter series got cencored because of the magic.To some people that might be an offensive book and if that book was taken off the shelve we would lose one of the greatest books and millions of people would be upset. So the way I see it everyone should be entitled on what books they can choose. To the people that don't like certain books just leave them there you don't like to read them thats fine. Everyone is entitled to there rights like Katherine Paterson said 'You have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for an of us' So we should all get to read what we enjoy to read, cause reading is endless.
1501	4478	2	3	Books should be removed only if they are found a certain degree of offensive. Some other books, though, are meant for educational use and not meant to offend anyone. People sometimes take it too seriously. Many books have posed a great educational source for many years. Books have been around for a very long time. People many years ago used to read books on scrolls, or even in pictures to tell stories. Stories have been around for a very long time and are meant to be stories, not criticised pieces of work to put down other people. There are a lot of books, however, that have been meant to put other people down. These books I agree should be taken off the shelves since they might promote people to turn on certain races. A good book that demonstrates it is not putting others down but sounds like it might is 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. This book has been intended for people to read it and learn of the life back when there was slavery or, a time just after slavery but where people did not respect the newly freed men. Another book that tells of times during slavery is 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'. This book tells of a young boy that runs away to live his old life and meets up with a runaway slave named Jim. This book has been meant to tell of what slaves would be punished by if they were caught. Many other books exist as these. But I guarentee that over ninety percentile of books are meant to be used for educational purposes due to the context they have been used in. Most people will take books the wrong way, but that is only because they are afraid that they will be judged, just as the book was judged by its cover. I have read many books over the past couple years, and I find that many of the books that I read have proved to be educational to me. There are some books though, that I agree should be taken off the shelves due to them being over the top on offensive. Censorship has a job to protect us from many unnerving topics and I agree that certain books should be taken off the shelves. But, I think that sometimes, places go over the top with censorship and should let certain people decide which books are right for a place, as well as movies. The world is maturing, even as everyone speaks, and people are learning all the time, so censorship should be applied judiciously, focusing on genuinely harmful content while preserving access to diverse perspectives and educational resources.
1502	4479	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' wrote by Katherine Paterson. If you think about it when you go into a library there is a ton of books to choose from. But how many do you think is appropiate for every age and including children, not very many. That is why they have sections for the books, but there are times people are rude and mix them up on purpose. How many times have you been in a library and find a misplaced book? Many of times right, that can be accidental or on purpose. I know if I took my child or children to a libraby and they got a book that was inappropiate for them, I would take it to the front desk and complain about that book. Now if it was a book that has been misplaced I would take it from them. But, yes there are some books, magazines, movies, and music that should be removed from the libray. I remember from when I was a little girl going into the library to check out books with my mom or my dad, it did not matter they both enjoyed taking me to the library. They were pleased that I loved to read but, one day my mom took me to get books from the library, she did not think about looking at the books I got until we got home and she realized on of my books had a cursing word in it. She was not happy at all, I had no clue what she was doing. But I figured it out, she grabbed me by my hand and took me to the car. She fastened me in and off we went, back to the library. She had no problem going off and complaining, I can remember her every word she said it sounded like this. 'Ma'am, my name is Johnson and this is my daughter Sally she is six years old. We were just her about an hour ago, but you want to know the funny reason we are back. Well if you can give me a funny reason for why my six year old daughter has a childs book from here with cursing in it. Please speak up and explain I would love to hear it.' The lady at the front desk was stunned she has never had someone go off on her for the seven years she had worked there. But the book is no longer in the library, I can not remember the title of this book, I just know that with a mom like mine she can get something done. Just like Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I can tell you from experience and observation, you can do and get what ever you want with a little power and persausion. It may cause trouble but just set your mind to it and you can help and solve problems when you do set your mind to it.
1503	4480	2	3	When you have children would you want to shield them from something you think is wrong, even though it goes on in the world around you every single day? Today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that, censorship. One thing about censorship is that it is just a way the government can control what everyday people say, hear, listen to, read, or even see in today's society. We shouldn't be controlled on what we can or can't read, watch, or listen to. I have experienced these things almost on a daily basis if it isn't on the radio it's on television. When someones words get beeped out for saying something vulgar or innapropriate.  The second thing about censorship is that no matter what it is, where it is, or even who it is someone will always have a problem with it. Just recently in one of my own classes we read an article about a very popular children's and young adult's film and a school tried to ban its books from its library because it dealt with sorcery. Most of every person I know that has read those books knows that sorcery isn't real. Why do people find it necessary to do things like that? I think most people just view something that could be entertaining to one person as completely disgusting and disturbing, just because it is a little bit different, I find that as unique not bad.  The third thing is no matter what public libraries shouldn't be censored. Everyone views things differently and they all have different tastes in music, literature, and films. Just because someone likes something someone else finds vulgar doesn't mean they should just be able to remove that from the library's public shelves. After all the library is public and I put a great deal of stress on it being public because every person in the world today are all different.  Today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that, censorship. Leaving off on a lighter foot, whether it is purple or green, or old or new, someone will always be able to find something wrong with it. I'm sorry to today's society for not being able to realize that most of its problem is trying to control everything that everyone does, which is a shame, because our diversity and differences are what make our society so beautiful and unique.
1504	4481	2	3	Libraries have no right in my mind to decide what is offensive and what isn't. Libraries shouldn't have the view on censorship; the people who rent or buy the items should. The library system has an idea of what is offensive, but they shouldn't be able to make that decision unilaterally. If the library system wants business, they should try to ensure their customers are happy and feel represented. Libraries should take surveys of what everyone wants in their collection. Not all the people in the world have the same idea of what is an offensive book, magazine, movies, music, etc. The different views of people can vary from a lot to none at all. If people feel that items are offensive, then they should bring it up with the library system and find a solution instead of getting rid of these items. A safe but easy solution would be to create a section just for offensive items the library system or people claim them to be. Another possible solution would be to rearrange the areas of the books into two main categories, such as offensive and non-offensive, and then break it down into their specific categories. So the libraries need to have a survey showing what items the people think are bad and the libraries' opinions and then go on from there. The surveys could be made up of a paper one you fill out in the library system to its online website. The survey would have a list of books, movies, magazines, and music that people could check off. Now the library system needs money to keep books and other items in stock and so they can repair them if necessary. So if the library system feels that a book is offensive, they shouldn't have the right to censorship. All these books have been in libraries for this amount of time; why change it now? Think about it; if it was offensive, why did they put it into the library system in the first place? So in conclusion, the library system should have no right to censor books, movies, magazines, music, or any other item they have. This would cost time and money, which they don't have. Customers could possibly stop coming in because of the change, which would be a loss of money. Now everyone knows a big loss of money could hurt any business and possibly bankrupt them or could take weeks, months, or even years to recover, and no business wants that; therefore, the easiest and most logical way to make sure that doesn't happen is to just leave everything the way it is.
1505	4482	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed if they are offensive to a race or any other kinds of beliefs unless they are biological or historical timelines. If the reading material is so offensive towards you or your beliefs, you @MONTH1 want to see a librarian and tell what you think about it so that the reading material will be removed off the shelves and gone. I think that if it goes against something in a bad way it should be removed and gone. I've read a magazine before and it had some offensive stuff. I went to the librarian, told her that I wanted this magazine off the shelves, and explained my reasons for finding it offensive. We argued for about five minutes and finally the magazine was off the shelves.  Nobody wants something to go against them in any way. That's why we should have offensive material off our libraries' shelves, to create a more comfortable and respectful environment for everyone.
1506	4483	2	3	PARENTS @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I believe that certain materials should not be shown. But then some books are not offensive to everybody, so it would be unfair if all books were removed from libraries. I can relate to @CAPS2 discovering books that's not educational for them. It's up to the parents to show their @CAPS2 what to read and what not to read, guiding them towards age-appropriate content. This can also happen with movies, certain movies that @CAPS2 can and can't watch. The reason I say this is because if it was up to @CAPS2 on their own to decide what they would want to do, it would usually be negative results. That's what parents are for.  I was young myself and I had experienced this too at one point. The type of movies I watched, I thought they were pretty cool, but I was too young to realize what I was watching and what I was trying to do from a movie. I had to learn from my parents that the things I were doing was not rational. Then I realize that I was making mistakes. It was nothing cool about it; friends had told me that as well. So I figured out the hard way. I don't want any @CAPS2 to experience that.  Not all parents can stop all @CAPS2 from discovering some disturbing things from books, music, magazines and all. What I'm trying to say that it can be reduced. Some parents can prevent it from happening by fostering open communication and setting boundaries. Sometimes things can get in sink to a @CAPS2 brain and it could never be helped or solved. These things are serious and some people don't take it lightly. And that's where it takes effect. It's up to kids' parents or role models to show that some things aren't meant for them to see until the right time.  I'm not telling parents to trap their @CAPS2 from the world. What I'm saying is that parents should let them know that they're going to witness some things. They just have to be prepared to see them and hopefully it doesn't take a negative impact on them. Hopefully they would be smart enough to tell what's right from wrong. It's up to the parents to assist their @CAPS2, guiding them towards responsible choices. It's up to the @CAPS2 to know what's good for them.  I do believe that some @CAPS2 are capable of growing out of some events they learned from movies, to know that they were young, because I grew out of that myself. And if I can do it, so can they. It's not impossible. One good thing is that some @CAPS2 grow up in a positive community to know not to read disturbing books/magazines, or watch disturbing movies. Ultimately, a combination of parental guidance, community influence, and a child's own developing judgment can help them navigate the world responsibly.
1507	4484	2	3	I say no to removing materials from libraries that are offensive to some. Just because one person finds something offensive doesn't mean it should be removed, as another person might enjoy it. A library is built for everyone's enjoyment. If someone finds something offensive, they shouldn't get upset because the material wasn't created to hurt them. The writer may have experienced similar things. Creators often express themselves through books, music, and movies, potentially encouraging others.  Personally, I haven't found anything offensive. If the writer wasn't talking to me, I don't feel I have the right to be upset, and this applies to everyone. People who are offended often focus on the negative. There's always a positive side, and with a positive attitude, one should see the brighter side.  Magazines often focus on celebrities, which shouldn't concern most people unless they're overly invested. Music is a form of self-expression, and people shouldn't be offended by a songwriter's expression. If that's their only outlet, preventing them is like saying their expression is unwanted. If someone disliked your form of expression and wanted you to stop, you wouldn't like that.  In conclusion, nothing should be removed from the library due to offensiveness. Materials are there for specific people, and everyone has different tastes; if something offends someone, it wasn't intended to do so.
1508	4485	2	3	Have you ever picked up a book, video, or music from the shelf and wondered why it's there, feeling it's unsuitable for our younger kids? I believe we should remove these types of books from our library shelves to better our community for our kids and their kids, as we have the right to voice our opinion on what should and shouldn't be in our library. Books that promote sexual activity, killing, drug use, and other harmful things aren't the best for our kids to read, listen to, or watch and should be removed.  Have you noticed the increase in crime and drug rates in recent years? These activities are sometimes promoted in books, videos, and other media. Removing media that promotes this behavior could potentially reduce these crimes. It's possible that without such media influence, we wouldn't see as much crime, because people often emulate figures from songs, TV shows, or books, and if those figures promote crime, people might follow suit. Humans often unconsciously follow the actions of others.  Music also plays a big role; music with bad language or promoting drug use or killing has been proven to affect our minds. Would you want your child raised in a community that promotes sex, drugs, killing, and other harmful behaviors? We all have musical preferences, and if a genre like rap promotes killing, listeners might be more likely to desensitize themselves to the idea of killing, viewing it as less of a crime because they enjoy the music.  We @CAPS1's in our community believe in abstaining from such behaviors, and consequently, we don't witness much drug use, killing, or sexual activity. The Bible teaches us to avoid things that promote drugs, killing, or sexual activity, which is why these behaviors are less common in a @CAPS2 home or community. @CAPS4 are often better off because they live a life after @CAPS3, that doesn't promote those behaviors. @CAPS4 abstain from media that promotes sex, killing, and drugs.  If you want to help make our community a better place for your children and future generations, let's remove harmful media promoting sex, drugs, and killing from our library. I don't think you want to see your child doing drugs or killing people and ruining their life because you didn't help remove this media. Please help us better our community for our children, their children, and the generations to come by supporting the removal of harmful media from our library.
1509	4486	2	3	No I do not think that any materials should be removed from libraries. A library should have lots of different kinds of books, magazines, music, and movies. One reason I think that a library should have all sorts of different books is because everybody doesn't like to read the same thing. Like for example some kids could love to read scary and gory books and others could like to read books about sports or love stories. So maybe the kids that read sport books could be offended by all the gory books, but that wouldn't be fair to take them out of the library because some kids like to read gory books. Another reason they shouldn't remove any magazines, books, etc, is because it is nice to get to read or look at different things. People would get bored if their library only had books about war. Kids need to learn how to read different kinds of stories, expanding their horizons. Also if your library has all different kinds of magazines kids could learn a lot of interesting facts. You can find a lot of amazing things in a magazine. So if you only had four magazines about the same thing kids wouldn't discover anymore cool facts. A library is a place where kids like to go and enjoy some peace and quiet and look and read different things. So I think if you started taking specific things out of the library then I think kids would stop coming to the library. A library contains awesome information that kids could learn, but if you start taking things out then not that many kids will come to the library because they will not be learning anything new. So if I had any say in this I would keep all things in the library. I would not remove anything! You want people to come to your library so you don't want to do anything that can jeopardize people coming to your library. I think if you start removing things then your going to have less and less people come in and eventually maybe your library will get shut down because you have no business. So leave everything on the shelves, fostering a space for diverse perspectives and continued learning for everyone in the community.
1510	4487	2	3	There are a lot of things to life and sometimes we do need as much help as we can get. Sometimes people will do anything to get help or go anywhere to find it because when people feel lost it's the scariest thing to a person. So they turn to reading books, listening to music, watching movies, also looking and reading magazines. But although that's not the best way you can go, there are times when you need to listen to your soul the most. Now there was a time when no one knew how to read or even was allowed to read, but nowadays reading has taken over. If you can read you can do anything, you could be the one to run the whole world one day if you read things right. Books and magazines, there is not a big difference between the two. Books can take your mind off somewhere that you have never seen before and places like the wild, the ocean, the mountains, @CAPS1's castles, and high up in trees. It teaches you some things, but not everything it teaches is good. Books can lie about what's about to happen to the world. Now magazines show you what all the stars are doing and how they're living and what their house looks like and their money their being home. There's one thing you have to understand you can't always get scared and think what you're reading is right, you have to read your mind and see what it says about what you just read. When you hear your favorite song what do you do, or when you see your favorite movie? Do start dancing or do you cry when they break up, do you say I can sing like her or do you re-enact the part in the movie. These things can help you or make you think about things you shouldn't do to people or even to yourself. Music can make you think about what your life has been through or miss the person that has died because they listened to that one song so much. Music can talk you into killing yourself drive you crazy, hurt your soul when hear what someone else has been through. Its all about how you take the song when you first hear it and take the messages out of it. Movies show history and show you want happens to people when they do the wrong things what will happen to them. There could be an icon in the movie your watching and could want to be like him/her. But not everyone you see you shouldn't want to be like them. You have to be yourself at the end of the day because you wake up looking at you everyday and love you everyday and take care of you everyday. When it's all said and done you have to believe in yourself and not listen to what everyone is trying you. Go with you soul. Yes listening to it or read or even watching it but just remember follow your dreams and do what you love, so that's what I think about music, books, movie and magazines listen but don't listen at the same time because in the end, your own intuition and desires are the most important guides in navigating life.
1511	4488	2	3	I think that movies and magazines should be censored for kids at the library. There are many reasons these things should be censored, and in this paper, I am going to explain why they should be censored. I am also going to give a few examples of some stuff that shouldn't be possible for kids to get. The main reason movies should be censored is because movies that are rated R are not only not supposed to be rented by children, but it is wrong to rent these movies to them. I mean, if there is a sex scene or something and you're only like eight years old, this would be awkward for the parents to explain what the actors are doing. I mean, if you were a parent, would you want to explain to your eight-year-old what sex is? The next thing that I think should be censored at the library is magazines. I know three in particular off the top of my head, and they are Cosmopolitan, Maxim, and Playboy. These three magazines talk about how to be better in bed. I really don't think any kid, teenagers included, should need to know how to be better in bed. They also have several unhealthy diets that teenagers might try. This could cause them to get very sick, and if they're already skinny, they could possibly die. Well, this pretty much sums up what I think about library contents being censored. I don't really think there are many books that are that bad for kids' ears and eyes. I mean, there are romances, but I don't think any kid is going to last through a whole romance because they are pretty boring. Well, I hope this will prevent libraries from letting kids get a hold of this kind of content, and I believe libraries should seriously consider stricter guidelines to protect children from inappropriate materials.
1512	4489	2	3	In libraries, some books, music, and magazines are not appropriate for open shelves, especially with young children present. Kids are naturally curious and might pick up anything. While libraries offer valuable and appropriate materials, offensive content can be found. If a patron finds something offensive, it should be removed. Libraries should screen materials upon arrival to prevent offensive content from being displayed. Movies are less of a concern since viewers can choose not to watch them.  However, bad music is a different story. Censorship should be considered due to the prevalence of themes like drugs, alcohol, and violence. Parents would not want their children exposed to such content in a library. It's upsetting to see inappropriate material accessible to minors, as children often idolize songwriters, which can have negative consequences.  Magazines, with their cover images, can also be offensive. Libraries generally avoid inappropriate magazines to prevent controversy, stocking only suitable options, including those for children.  Libraries likely don't intentionally stock offensive materials. Censorship of books, movies, music, and magazines could protect children from harmful content and prevent controversy. Parents don't want their kids emulating figures involved in violence, drugs, or alcohol. Censorship is a viable solution for ensuring safety and preventing controversy.
1513	4490	2	3	Censorship can be considered as a major problem. I believe it is our right to read and publish what we want. It should not be another person's opinion effecting what we can and cannot read, listen to, or even watch. Lastly, censorship is a popular communist trend. Therefore, I believe censorship is wrong. First of all, we have a right to say, read, write, and watch what we want, as long as it is not slandering someone. I don't believe that issue of slander is what is causing the censorship of many books today. So, in any other case censorship would be wrong and immoral. Second, it shouldn't be someone elses opinion that effects whether anything is censored. My opinion may differ from another person's and their opinion may be way different from someone elses. If they think it should be censored, they shouldn't read it themselves. Others may find the book, movie, or magazine to be great and very informative or interesting. Lastly, censorship is a communist trend. Last I checked, the United States is a democracy. So, it would be going back on our fundamentals of government to censor anything that isn't detrimental or slander to a person or race. So, censorship shouldn't be allowed anywhere; it limits personal freedom. It is a very communist thing to do. It infringes our rights. Lastly, opinions are varied among people what should and should not be censored making it impossible to know what really should and shouldn't be censored, and therefore it should not be permitted.
1514	4491	2	3	Throughout history there have always been those who have refuted the beliefs and ideals of others. Whether that be in **Europe** when statues were censored by removing anything deemed offensive by the **Catholic** church or the mass burning of books to preserve ideals that could invalidated through the clear spoken text. However this in not the **21st century**, women are not looked down upon anymore, science is not dillouted, and ideas are free throughout the world with the internet. So is it the libraries fault for providing uncensored content or is the parents fault, for not educating their children on the morality of such items? The modern library has very specific demographics for all items to which it posses. Movies over **PG13** attract both parents and teenagers alike, the music entices the teenagers, and the books and prior two media sources attract younger children. So how would it be fair to force a library to censor two of the things that earn the library the most money just so that kids don't read,watch or hear them. Plus libraries generally don't let young kids check out **R** rated movies or parental advisory **music**. Some people however argue that books are the most dangerous thing to children and young adults. As books can raise ideas and strengthen them in a teens mind over the course of **300** pages till parents end up with an anti-sematic teen with bad view on racism. So then why would that be the fault of the library as it merely provided one book that should not have affected that teen so much, had that teen had solid moral beliefs instilled in him or her from their parents. So if you find materials at a library offensive, or worry about your child going there, there's always an easy solution. Don't go their and don't let your child go their. However if you see the beauty in impurity that a library brings to a community and to a person as I do then don't allow the injustice to authors, songwriters, musicians, directors, and yourself occur. We must appreciate the freedom of information and the role libraries play in making it accessible, while also recognizing the responsibility of parents to guide their children's understanding and critical thinking.
1515	4492	2	3	Censorship exists everywhere. Children overhear parents and often repeat what they hear, so they should understand what cursing is and that it's wrong. Children should have reading choice, while books specifically for them should be censored. Adults should freely choose their reading material. Sheltered children need to learn that curse words exist in reality. We can gain knowledge from anything we read. Books can offer facts teachers omit. Uncensored speech excites children; reading independently expands their knowledge. Parental silence can lead to missing vital life information. Movie ratings are unnecessary; parents should decide if their children watch mature content. Ultimately, the choice should rest with the parent. Derogatory images in magazines are harmful, causing insecurity about appearance. Children absorb much of what they see and hear, so they should have control over what they read, thereby allowing them to make informed decisions and develop their own understanding of the world.
1516	4493	2	3	'@CAPS1 day @CAPS4 @CAPS3, my dad was pulled over three times for @CAPS2: @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5.' @CAPS6 is just @CAPS1 of several quotes from a book that I am reading that some people could take offense to. The book in general is a rather appeasing book, it's just some things, people might take offense to. That doesn't mean the book shouldn't belong on shelves. I don't think that libraries should be forced to take books off shelves just because they offended someone. That's like saying you should shoot everyone who has made an offensive comment to somebody in their life, you would be left with nothing in the end. If someone finds the things that other people have to say, offensive, they generally stop hanging out with that person. Therefore, it would only make sense for someone to stop reading a book if they find it offensive. Some magazines have really offensive things in them, that people in the real world say. It's not like your generic non-fiction books that come up with insulting things to say, at a high school level. You don't have to subscirbe to that particular magazine, or even pick it up to read. These days, so many things offend so many people, in so many different ways. What might offend @PERSON1 down the street, @PERSON2 across town might find funny.You cannot make everyone happy, and if you took books off the shlef because someone complained about the offensive things that they read, you would be trying to appease to everyones' wants and needs. I think it would be fair to put a restriction on books, about age limits. Some of the more offensive ones could have the higher age limits. At the junior high I attended, they have books categorized as 'young adult' books, which means you either have to be in eighth grade or have a note from your guardian saying that it's alright for you to read those types of books. It'd be just like movies; movies have the ratings so that only certain people can watch them, why can't they do the same with books? I guess what I am trying to say is that it would be very disappointing to me and numerous other people if you just started taking books, @CAPS7, movies, magazines, and so on, off the shelves, and out of market just because someone cried foul against it. If they don't like the material that they are looking at, reading, watching, listening to, or all the above, no @CAPS1 is forcing them to pay attention to it. They can go read the nursery rhymes, because those are not offenesive. Once again I say, taking a book off the shelf everytime someone complains about the material would be like shooting every person who has ever made an offensive comment to someone in their lifetime, you'd be left with nothing, making the removal of books based solely on offense an impractical and ultimately detrimental approach.
1517	4494	2	3	Taking books off the shelves? I don't think so. When you go to the library, what kind of books do you look for? I like mysteries and scary books, they keep me on the edge of my seat, however; some that I have read might not be appropriate for children younger than me. People are saying they want to remove books, music, and movies from the library when they are found offensive, but I think that is a bad idea. People don't always read books or watch movies because it is their choice. You can find a lot of younger kids at the library theses days for school purposes. From my own experience, I had to get a movie at the library once for a project. It was about the civil war. The movie had some disturbing scenes in it, but I had to watch it for school. If it had not been at the library, what would I have done? That is one reason why I do not think taking books and movies off the shelves would be a good idea. As I said at the beginning, I like mystery books. Some mystery books have parts in them that might be offensive. The book I am reading now is about a murder of a young girl. I think this would be an offensive book for someone young, or for someone who's loved one was murdered, but that does not mean I think they should remove it from the library. If they took books like that away, what would the people that like them do? It does not seem fair to me. For people who find books, movies, music, or magazines at the library offensive, simply do not use them. The library is a place where you can find almost anything you are interrested in, and we should consider that everyone has different interests. It is also a place where you can find a lot of information even though it could be offensive. It would not be fair or right to remove books from the library.
1518	4495	2	3	In my opinion, censorship of any kind shouldn't exist, especially in libraries. Libraries are where anyone can go and check out a book, CD, magazine, or movie. It's where the poor can have access to the same materials the better off have. If you take away opinions in books, music, film or magazine/newspaper articles, then you're taking away the author's right to freedom of speech just because someone deemed it offensive. The right to free speech is an important one in the USA, we can have opinions here, we can choose our beliefs, and if someone wants to share their beliefs and opinions by form of writing, then they should be allowed. Writing is a form of expression, writers can express their thoughts, use their imagination to come up with fantasy worlds and unique characters. Who does one think they are to say it's offensive? Who gets to decide that this book of movie is offensive? If we take away books that one person finds 'offensive', we wouldn't have anything to read. Some people today find the BIBLE offensive, but we still put that in libraries, some people today find books on wizardry and vampires offensive, yet those are all the rage now, we wouldn't take those away. Things that people find offensive are just opinions--just like the ones of those of the writers. It just simply wouldn't work out--if you want young people to read, you have to give them something to read that will stimulate their interests, and sometimes that today be 'offensive', demonstrating the delicate balance between individual expression and perceived societal norms.
1519	4496	2	3	There are many different kinds of books in the library. Not all of them are for the eyes of every person out there. I think that libraries should censor the books, movies, and magazines so that either they are in a certain room where only adults can see or get them, or they are not in the library at all. The books in the libraries can have some very obseen items in them that young children should not be able to see. I have been to the library many times, whether it be by myself or with others. I know what is out there and some of the books or movies are not always kid rated. I would like to someday beable to take my own child into the library knowing that what they are going to see is okay for their eyes. Magazines are always talking about new relationships or this person is having a baby or anything along those lines, and I don't want my child seeing that. The library I usually go to has the magazines out where everyone can view them and I don't want this for my son or daughter who is of a young age. I think a parent should be able to take their children into a library knowing that when their child runs up to them with a book, it will be something that they are aloud to read or get and not something that an adult would read. Libraries could always make a seperate room for books and movies that are not always for children. Such as the rated @CAPS1 movies or books that are inappropriate for young children. That way when a little kid is running around looking for a new book to read, they can't see or pick up these books or movies. I don't know about the other adults or parents out there, but I sure don't want my little kid walking around talking about an inappropriate book or movie they saw at the library. Since libraries have many different kinds of magazines, books, and movies, it is not always a safe place to just let your child roam around. Libraries could always make a seperate room for items like this. For the books that are for older @ORGANIZATION1, movies that are rated @CAPS1, or magazines such as @ORGANIZATION1. I think that if libraries did this, parents would be much more at ease to taking their children and letting them run around and look for new and interesting books to read or movies to watch. Specifically, materials for mature audiences could be placed in a designated section, ensuring that younger children are not exposed to potentially unsuitable content, which would ultimately make the library a more welcoming and secure environment for families.
1520	4497	2	3	There are many reasons why censorship can be thought of as a good thing, or a bad thing. I am against censorship. My reasons are that just because something is there that you don't like, doesn't mean that you have to look at it or use it. There are plenty of people that would like to have access to that information or entertainment. Another reason is, that if there's something that someone doesn't want their child looking at, then they should either trust that their child won't look at it, or prevent them from seeing it. Finally, what would be left if everyone were to remove something that they took offense to? Nothing would be left to read, listen to or watch.  First, why I think censorship is wrong, is that the people that take offense to what they want removed, don't have to look at what's offensive. No one is forcing them to look at it or use it. They're better off just ignoring it. Because other people, that don't take offense to it, have the right to look at or use it. The library might be the only place that someone could have access to that sort of material, providing diverse perspectives and knowledge. So if someone were to remove that material, the person that needs or wants it, would not have the access to use it. And they are given the right to use it. Their child might even have the right to it, as part of their intellectual freedom.  Second is that some people wouldn't want their child seeing those things. But removing it shouldn't be that person's first instinct. I believe that the parent should be able to trust their own child not to look at it, fostering open communication and critical thinking. And if they can't, then they need to somehow prevent their child from viewing it; not by removing it. The parent should be able to come up with a reasonable way of preventing their child from viewing things that they don't want the child viewing, rather than taking that thing away from the child, and the whole community.  Lastly, let's say that in a library, there's at least one book to each person in a community that offends that person. If they were each given the right to remove the book that offended them, what would be left to read? Absolutely nothing. And each of those people that removed a book, most likely would enjoy another book that someone thought was offensive. So now there isn't a single book for that person to read, just because everyone else disliked the books they didn't think were offensive. Once someone starts removing, other people will join in, and you'd be left with an empty library.  That's what I think about censorship. It's really just wrong. Personally, I would like to be able to go to my library and pick out a good book. And I know other people like to do that too. So why should anyone else be able to take that away from them, depriving them of the freedom to explore different ideas and perspectives? Censorship ultimately restricts access to information and limits intellectual growth, making it a harmful practice.
1521	4498	2	3	Have you ever read or listened to something that is so disturbing that you wonder how it even got the right to be published? Well, music, books, and magazines these days are full of garbage and inappropriate thoughts that children listen to and base their life off of. All of these resources that kids can find that has this kinda of material in it can be found in libraries. We have to put an end to it or find some source of censorship for these library resources.  A library has the tendency to be known as boring or a very plain place. If a kid in school comes through the hallway saying he found a really good book, other kids become interested in it; they find out it has drugs in it and they assume that this is not a boring book like all the others that you would find in a library. Then, more and more people get that book and other books that have this style of materials are being discovered and checked out. Now, all these children with these popular books consider themselves 'cool'. So, these children start making actions and start behaving the same way the characters are in the book. This leads to disaster.  Music can be the same way. Music that has been recorded in the past ten years pick up sexual references, drug usage, and inappropriate behavior in its lyrics. Why would anyone want to put this kind of material in there masterpiece? Well singers and writers have found out that pieces containing these topics have sold the most copies. So, every artist of any kind of work is putting these references in there books or songs. Now, singers are starting to make music videos which not along sings these lyrics but shows them as well. Children see these artist in these videos with attractive mates, lots of money, and living the 'perfect life'. So, this person try doing the same thing this artist did to make there life more like theirs.  Movies come along then, movies have seen the ratings go up on these kind of styles, so they start putting them in there film. Now, all these pieces have this garbage in it and has had it in it for quite some time. How do we get it out? How do we get our children to stop getting these resources? No parents want to walk around and hear there children saying these things or doing these actions. So libraries have to have some censorship on there work; there work should be removed so minors wont get the wrong message.  Whatever happened to the good old days when music, movies, and art was a special talent and was not looked up to as something that would get our children into some trouble? We need to get these censorships in libraries and get back to the good old days before things get more out of hand than they already are, ensuring a safer and more wholesome environment for the younger generation.
1522	4499	2	3	"I don't believe that materials like books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. Libraries shouldn't be places for criticizing others' beliefs. If you encounter something offensive, simply ignore it. People shouldn't spend time worrying about what others think, even though it happens. As @PERSON2 rightly said, ""If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" Kids today often know more than they should anyway, so why censor what they already know? Imagine wanting to read a Holocaust series with interconnected stories about life in the camps, but because a @CAPS2 finds it offensive and claims it disgraces their home country, making people think they're all like the @CAPS5, it gets removed. Would you just find another book, or be upset about not finishing the series? Many people find things offensive daily when they shouldn't. People try to act superior, which isn't right. If you're easily offended by books, movies, music, or magazines, focus on living life instead of dwelling on petty grievances. Music may use words that some like to be called, but if another race uses them, it's not necessarily racist, offensive, or directed at you. Just stop complaining. Katherine Paterson, @CAPS6, if you're concerned about children reading potentially offensive books, realize that it's positive they're reading and improving their skills. There are magazines and movies on shelves that might offend some, but if they offend you, why are you even looking at them? I don't think any books should be removed from any library shelf. Removing books is like telling people to stop reading, and it is essential to allow access to diverse perspectives, even those that may be offensive, and trust individuals to make their own judgments."
1523	4500	2	3	They have a book in the libary called 'A CHILD CALLED IT' if you ever read IT you might cry. When they have IT in the basment they have him eat off the floor eat his brothers thow up and even eat warms. they beet him and thell he haves booes all over his body his dad broke his arm in two form his dad and mom fighting so much that his brothers cant tock TO him no more so his brother called the cops and the cops came and we all were gone. two years latter him and his brother got adopined there new mom and dad were good too them even thow they had six brother and five sisters but they all got a long and the had a good live afther there relly mam and dad died, allowing them to finally heal and find peace.
1524	4501	2	3	When someone goes to the library, there are multiple items to choose from. There are books, music, movies, magazines, etc. But not all of this is necessarily a good thing. There are several books, movies, and music albums that can be either offensive or not right for a library's audience. The material that is offensive should not be on the shelves for children's sake. Although there are many good items in a library, there are also bad or offensive items as well. For example, an explicit music album. If an explicit music album is just sitting on the shelf of a library, then any person could listen to it or take it out for a while. By taking out the bad music, that keeps younger kids away from the explicit music that most parents don't want their children listening to anyway. Movies are also a problem in libraries. For example, libraries having R rated movies on the shelves for anyone to take out to go watch. Most R rated movies have something in them that doesn't make them child-appropriate. Movies that are R rated are rated that because of all the mature material in the movie. This is why when these movies are played on television, they are edited so all audiences can watch. So by taking these types of movies off the shelves in libraries, it keeps young children away from inappropriate behavior. Books are the same way as movies and music. There are books on the shelves that some people consider 'funny', but in all reality, it's a harmful book. There are books made that include racial material in them, even derogatory statements. By taking these types of books off the shelves of libraries, a lot more people wouldn't be introduced to all the racial comments that occur. For the sake of the children and young kids, any material that is found offensive in libraries should be removed. If libraries would just remove all the bad materials, it'll make all libraries a more healthy and stable environment for studying like it used to be used for. Take out all the offensive material, then they could put more educational books, movies, etc., creating a more positive and enriching space for everyone.
1525	4502	2	3	What is offensive in libraries? The offenses in libraries are inappropriate and non-censored books, music, magazines, movies, and other materials in libraries. These books and other things in these libraries should not be removed from the shelves. They should not be removed because the authors of the books are just writing. From my own experience, I have seen inappropriate movies. To me, I feel that they teach me some lessons, but, it also depends on what type of movie it is. If it is rated R then I know that I might see some blood, gory scenes, and nudity. If this type of movie is not censored or fake, then I know that some of this stuff on the screen might happen in real life. Most might not happen, but there is a good chance that some of it will happen to someone in the world. All of this teaches me to be more careful about what I am doing and where I am doing it at. In libraries, there should not be nudity websites, books, or magazines or anything like that because that is just stupid and inappropriate for any child to see, especially in a public library. Now if a gory or a book with lots of blood in it, then it should stay on the shelves. I say it honestly shows and maybe teaches others not to do the same thing. So, as I ask again, what might be offensive in libraries? Some might say that books, magazines, movies etc. with racial slurs are offensive; but to others, it just shows how cruel and horrible the world can be. In my perspective, I just feel that the authors of these books are just writing and lets the creativeness take over. That might be it, it might not. In so many words, I say that the 'offensive' books, magazines, music, movies and other materials should stay on the shelf; for so many reasons I have said, and the ones I have not said, they help people learn, giving them the chance to confront difficult realities and form their own informed opinions.
1526	4503	2	3	Libraries should exercise more caution regarding the materials they make available. Given the diverse population that frequents libraries daily, it's essential to designate specific areas for age-appropriate content. Libraries should implement stricter oversight of the material patrons access daily and prioritize better organization. Libraries welcome individuals of all ages, including children, who often select various materials. Children should only access age-appropriate content. Implementing stricter censorship and control over materials children can access prevents exposure to inappropriate content. Parents wouldn't want their seven-year-old encountering offensive material, right? Libraries should segregate adult-only material into distinct sections, minimizing the risk of children accessing inappropriate content. Furthermore, some books deemed suitable for children may still contain offensive content. For example, books may inadvertently depict racism or other forms of discrimination, which can be harmful, especially to children. Libraries must carefully assess the suitability of books for specific age groups and their overall appropriateness for the establishment. The current practice of unsupervised book checkouts for children is problematic. Parental consent should be mandatory for children borrowing books. Libraries may not always notice when a book is missing, and by then, it's often too late. Children might be tempted to steal books they know they shouldn't have, and lax security facilitates this. The child's mind can become corrupted, and the library bears some responsibility. Organization is paramount. Libraries need to improve the organization of their materials. This involves reviewing the content they make available. With a little more effort, children can be prevented from accessing inappropriate materials. Attention must be paid to the library's environment. Books and children coexist. Even if children are in the appropriate section, a misplaced adult book can still pose a risk. Such incidents can be prevented through better organization, safeguarding children. As demonstrated, libraries may not prioritize child safety as much as parents do. While inclusivity is important, designated areas should be enforced, and children should not be allowed in adult sections. Adult books should not be in children's areas, as this can lead to corruption. Stricter libraries are needed, with enhanced security measures to monitor children's access and material placement. Libraries must carefully evaluate the appropriateness of materials for all readers. By increasing organization, these concerns can be addressed, resulting in a safer and more suitable environment for everyone.
1527	4504	2	3	Pornography, vulgar language, grotesque scenes and many other things make books and movies inappropriate for some. In a culture like the one we have today, censorship usually takes the back seat. The media constantly portrays sensual elements and the language is also bad. People have always had a right to view what they want and read what they want due to the freedom that this very country provides. Every person is titled with their own opinion but there should not be censorship in libraries. There are many things in libraries today that portray bad images and contain questionable content. Books and movies have things in them that indeed children shouldn't view, but the library is not able to take them down. People enjoy seeing and hearing these things, that's why Hollywood comes out with more rated R movies than all the other ratings combined. They make the most money off of them. In today's economy, the library needs to keep these things on their shelf so that they can stay in business. If people are offended by it, then stay away from that area and don't pick up the book or movie. If someone were to decide to take down a book or movie that they view as offensive then they are breaking the freedom that this has. Censorship is an opinion based topic that one cannot make on their own. As one can see, the censorship of books and movies is not entitled to a personal opinion. It is the duty of the library to keep the freedoms of the people and provide them with the entertainment that they want. Books and movies with adult content in them can also provide insight on what a society should not be like. Parents should modify what their children watch, but as an adult they are able to watch or read anything that they want, and libraries should respect this freedom of choice.
1528	4505	2	3	Hey my name is @PERSON1 and I have some things to talk about that people need to hear. I think that libraries are a good thing for people of all ages but, there are some books in the library that are not made for children to read or evan see. They should at least put them in a seprate part of the library. I had an experince like this once. I was about to leave to go to the library when my little brother asked if he could come with me. I didnt want to take him but I couldnt say no to him. He got his shoes on and he ran to the door, he was so excited. We pulled up to the library and he took off running to the doors. I chased after him, when I caught him I told him that he couldnt run away from me like that. We went inside, it was a giant library. He went to find a book to look at and I went to find a good book to read. I found one that looked very interesting I got it and started to read it. Then @CAPS1 ran to me and said I should go take a look at the book he was looking at, so I went with him to go see the book. He handed it to me and I just lost it, the book was not a children book at all. It was one of the worst books that I have ever seen, we left the library and never came back. I think that books that are bad for children should be in there own section in the library. This section should be for grown ups only and that no children are aloud in there. This is what I think sould be done to all libraries so that children are safe from inappropriate content and parents can feel secure about bringing their kids to the library.
1529	4506	2	3	Censorship in libraries has been a major concern in school systems for many years. In many school libraries certain books, music, movies, and magazines have been removed because of the content in them. These items can be removed for these common types of content wich include, use of violence, sexual acts, drug use, and inapropriate language. Many parents of young kids are always wondering what their kids are doing at school. Most parents would not want to find out that their kids are being introduced to such things at a young age, because it could influence them to participate in these activities.  In my opinion I do believe that certain material in school libraries should be removed but not in public libraries because a public library can be divided into sections depending on age groups. In elementry and middle school libraries, items should be censored because young students do not need to be introduced to things that are inapropriate or violent in anyway. Exposure to such themes can be confusing and potentially harmful during these formative years. In a school environment kids should only be introduced to drug use, and sexual activity through some sort of health class because there is where they will learn the true facts and it would be more educational for them, rather than hearing about drugs, sex, and violence in a song or seeing some form of it in a movie.  Many kids watch movies that have very violent, and inapropriate scenes, and some of the songs in the world today are exstreamly inapropriate for young kids. Their are also many books and magazines that should not be read by young students at school because of the content in them, this is why I do believe that censorship in libraries is a great thing. By carefully curating the materials available to younger students, schools can help foster a more positive and age-appropriate learning environment, which is why I firmly support censorship in school libraries for elementary and middle school students.
1530	4507	2	3	WE ALL DON'T THINK OF ANYTHING WHEN YOUR CHILDREN CHECK OUT BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARIES. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, we do not want your children getting hold to the censorship of bad book, movie, music or magazines. Parents don't want to come home and there child learn a new word from the new book or movie he/she just checked out from the library, or reading a magazine from the library. It might makes your children attitude change putting bad influence on your kid because of a trip to the library. So there for the children should have a section where they pick out there book and they shouldn't be able to check out the censorship book. Therefore, a designated children's section with age-appropriate materials is essential to protect them.  WE NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR CHILDREN BE MORE CONVINCED ABOUT THIS TOPIC. This measure will help ensure a positive and safe library experience, safeguarding their innocence and values.
1531	4508	2	3	I believe that censoring books in a library could be both good and bad. I think that there are different levels of censorship that should be enforced depending on the library. In elementary school libraries, I think it would be appropriate to censor the books that are bought and used in the library. Elementary kids are not as mature as an adult or a high school student, so their reading level is not as advanced. Parents would definitely not want their children to be reading books that contain sex, drug usage, and violence. This is because reading these books might put ideas into their heads; it might teach them things that they aren't supposed to do, and they might think that it is alright to act out on what they learn from a book.  On the other hand, high schoolers, such as myself, are interested in those kinds of books. I am mature enough to know not to act out on what I read, and I am already aware of most of the things that books present. While some guys are into violent books about shooting, or football, a lot of girls are interested in romance books, that possibly express more than what most kids should know. In high schools, there should be less censorship due to the fact that we are more mature and should be able to read what we are interested in.  In public libraries, I think there should be sections of books based on age level, which most libraries already have. This way, parents taking their children to the library will know in which way they should direct them. Everyone is obligated to their own choices, whether that choice is to read books that are more likely to be offensive, is their choice.  All in all, I don't think that books should be removed from the shelves if found offensive, because books are a type of outlet to people. They can be educational, read for entertainment, or just read to keep you preoccupied. Books are everywhere, and people have every right to read whatever they please. On the other hand, I think it is a great idea to censor books and categorize them to reduce the chances of young children running into books they aren't supposed to, and to keep all of their parents happy! Ultimately, a balanced approach to censorship acknowledges both the value of free access to information and the need to protect younger readers, ensuring that libraries can serve diverse communities effectively.
1532	4509	2	3	I think that everyone has their own opinion on what they listen to, what they watch, and what they read. I believe that some stuff can change our world. It shouldn't be removed because of people's offense, or there will be nothing left to sell; if people had their points of being offended, because everything is offensive to at least one person, it would be impossible to create anything. I think they need to get rid of things that cause weak-minded people to do things if they see it and have it in their mind and go do it in real life, getting rid of the things that can get the weak mind in trouble. I think that everything we see or hear can be changed, and this can change the world, and that's what the world needs, to change what we could not think of before. Ultimately, focusing on positive change and removing extremely harmful influences can help shape a better world for everyone.
1533	4510	2	3	I think that censorship should be allowed in high school. For one, students who read books or watch the movies that are censorship can learn a lot from it. Also, I believe that if books are bad and not appropriate at school then why are they here? Movies that are not allowed because of its rating I think is lame because it might have pictures of naked people and bad language but we are high school students and we should be able to watch them because they are educational and we are mature enough to watch. Nevertheless, I believe that censorship is a good and bad thing but overall I think it should be allowed. Therefore, books or movies that are censored, shouldn't be because I personally think that students learn better from recent rated R movies than some old movie that's in black and white. Kids pay more attention to good interesting movies and the old movies most student fall asleep or just doesn't pay attention at all. So after that, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools. If books and movies are so bad then why would they even have some here already. I think its foolish for teachers or administrators to think that we are too immature to watch rated R movies like every kid at school watches them at home, I believe. Yeah I know some movies show some scenes that aren't school related but who cares we will get over it. Overall I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools. Well then last point is that all these helps us in a way if you really think about it. Get a classroom with computers and for a week let them listen to music while they work and for another week don't let them listen to anything than see which comes out better. Personally listening to music makes me concentrate better and keeps me on course to get my work done. So therefore, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools. So you got my opinion on censorship and I hope it helped you out to look at this situation better or clearer. I think rated R movies should be allowed at high schools and any music should too I mean its not like we are in prison, right? So there you got my opinion that censorship should be allowed at high schools.
1534	4511	2	3	Should there be censorship in libraries? Some say there should be, some do not. Cultural books and magazines could be offensive to some readers. History in books can sometimes even be offensive depending on someones lifestyle or background. Are you wrong if you say you want censorship in the library? No, you are not wrong because there are many people who think that some books should be taken off of the shelves of there local libraries. Some of there reasons are because parents could have young children and they do not want to expose them to such things while they are young and vulnerable. Others though say that censorship is unnecessary because people are going into the library and looking for a book at their own risk. Meaning that if someone goes to the library looking for a certain book and they pick up one they find as offensive, it could be a good book for someone else. Do all books that are considered 'offensive' have to be fiction? No, not all books have to be fiction if they are offensive. This does not mean that there aren't books out there like that. Cultural books or magazines from other countries or of a certain topic can sometimes be very graphic and have language that is only appropriate for certain ages. Everywhere in the WORLD no matter where you are there are going to be things that could either interest you or be offensive to you. Everybody has there own opinion on the matter. The cultural BOOKS in the library are just showing how the people of other countries live and act. It is not opinions or false claims in these BOOKS, only fact. So cultural BOOKS should not be censored, although it could have a section just for that type of material. History books can be one of those BOOKS that really depends on your opinion or what you were raised in. Religion is one thing that history books can really raise offense to people because it could have some of the facts wrong about that type of religion. Some people would get very upset about how it was wrong because they are teaching the kids wrong about religion. Race and origin are another problem with some people. History books and elder's stories can always somehow be mixed and could cause trouble. For example if a WORLD WAR 2 veteran told a story about what happened in a certain area; the history book could tell a completely different story. History books should not be censored because it is facts and teaching kids on what has happened in the past and how people survived. My views on the censorship of libraries is that there should not be any of it. Maybe the library could make a section for what people might think is 'offensive.' BOOKS or books should definately not be taken off of the shelves though, because one man's offense is another man's great read, and access to diverse materials is crucial for fostering intellectual growth and understanding.
1535	4512	2	3	Today, millions of teens are bombarded with all kinds of media garbage, ranging from exposure to certain movies, music, magazines, books, or even commercials. Parents, teachers, and even governments censor materials such as these to protect the students or the general population on topics that can be offensive or difficult to explain. However is that really the right choice? In life, we cannot shut our eyes and pretend that there are not harsh concepts out there in the world that we have to face. In fact, our parents and teachers should prepare us to be fully equiped when we go off on our own to find our place in the world. This then begs the question is it okay to censor certain books from the shelves of a library which can potentially enlighten us as growing students? When one conceals information, that person is stealing the right of knowledge. Not only that, but what one person finds offensive another can not. This topic is just too abstract to be regulated. For example, take what Katherine Paterson said about how if everyone decided to work in this manner, all the books in the world wouldn't be available to any of us. Therefore censorship in libraries should be condemned because we are only hurting ourselves in the long run when we limit the knowledge we decide to take in. Ultimately, restricting access to diverse perspectives hinders intellectual growth and the ability to form informed opinions, leaving us less prepared for the complexities of the world.
1536	4513	2	3	In our great country we have many freedoms, one of these is the freedom to read, hear, and see what we want. We all have different views that go with this freedom such as what we watch on television, what we read in our spare time, and what music we like to listen to. However, if we had the right to remove things we do not like we will ruin the enjoyment for others. This would eventually remove our freedom. Many authors, musicians, and directors have stated that this freedom is important for having an enjoyable and creative life. We as individuals have different views on many things. Luckily our freedoms allow us to have these views without interfering with the views or ideas of others. If we removed the books, movies, magazines, etc., there would not be anything for anyone. Our libraries would be emptied, the classrooms would not have books, and the stores would not have anything. We should not have the right to remove what we think is inappropriate or does not follow our values or interests. Even though the right of removing things sounds like a good idea, we should consider the thoughts and ideas of others. Consider a public library, it has books for children, teens and adults with individual preferences, and a school library with books for children and teens with their own preferences on what they like to read. If we allow this right then these libraries which allow individuality would not be able to exist. People would be unable to live up to their freedoms of individuality, as they would be curtailed by others' preferences. Everyone should be allowed to be themselves. Imagine what it would be like if we expanded this right to the foods that we buy. We all have different tastes of food that appal and satisfy us. The foods that we choose are a lot like the books we read, there are kinds we favor and others that we would just try to avoid. No one would have any food to eat at a restaurant, at school, or anywhere else, not even at home, if we allowed people to remove what they don't like. It would turn out to be a disaster. We should not have this right because it would not be fair to anyone. Our views in October may be different but we have similar needs. The freedom we have is a freedom of choice. If we do not find a certain book, movie, or magazine to be appropriate we should choose to allow others to have the chance to pick it up and see if it fits their values and interests. Other people will allow this chance too. After all, aren't individuality and choice what made the freedoms we have on July 4th so precious?
1537	4514	2	3	Should books be removed from shelves if they are offensive? Who would determine if something is offensive or not and to whom it offends? These are just two questions that can create a high level of conflict and issues among many people. Would removing books from shelves limit our possibility to learn or see something from a different point of view? First of all, who decides what is offensive and who it offends? It is possible for anything to offend anyone. Also removing a book from the shelves could be offensive to the writer and the followers of the writer. Bringing up removing a book from shelves could cause more problems then just letting the book remain on the shelves. If offending others is the issue then would it not be better to leave it alone over all, rather than making it an issue to please one group but in turn upsetting another? Secondly, could removing a book from the shelves limit your ability to learn something or hear something from another point of view? If books that offended people would have always been removed for reasons of offending other we could not have much of the knowledge we have today. For example a biology book might be offensive to people whose religion explains things differently and would make things untrue, and a religious document such as 'The Bible' or 'The Quran' could be offensive to the people who believe the biology books to be true. If we removed both types of books from the shelves for being offensive, we would not have religion or modern science. This example could be used for any topic or genre of book because people can take many different things as offensive. As a solution, I believe it true that it is not possible to please everyone. If one person is pleased another is offended. If that person is pleased then the first person is offended. If books could possibly labeled as 'some might take offensive' or 'material may be offensive' then people have a warning and they can choose if they want to read it or not. If they are offended they can not put blame on the author or wherever they got the book because there was a warning. It would be just like the parental warnings on cd's. This may not fix the problem of people being offended, but it could very much reduce the amount of complaints about a book being offensive. In conclusion, books should just be left on the shelves regardless of people complaining about them being offensive. Books being taken off shelves could turn into all books being taken off shelves which means no education or learning, that is just not an option. Leaving books that offend certain people on the shelves may cause controversy with others but if some sort of warning could be put in place and the proper procedures are preformed, the issues should decrease greatly; ultimately allowing for the free exchange of ideas and the opportunity for individuals to make informed decisions about what they choose to read. Think about all this the next time you want a book to be removed from the shelves.
1538	4515	2	3	I agree with Katherine's statement, but to a certain extent. If a book or magazine has cursing or anything offensive in it, then a student should take it to the librarian and let him/her know they are offended by it, especially in middle or elementary school. Of course, there's going to be a book or movie or magazine that has something inappropriate in it. One day my friend and I were in the library looking for a book to read, and that's when I first discovered the @CAPS1 series. But as I got into the books, the more mature they got. In the last book, @ORGANIZATION1, it has a lot of profanity in it. But that doesn't mean I'm not mature enough to not know what it means, and the same goes for any other high school student. But you can't protect your children from everything, not even curse words. So if you see a book at a local library that is absolutely filled with offensive things, and you decide you want it removed, just take it to your librarian and confront him/her; I'm sure they'll understand. Or maybe they won't, and they'll wait to see if anyone else will want it removed. Ultimately, you can always voice your concerns and try to make a difference, even if complete protection isn't possible.
1539	4516	2	3	Books intended for mature audiences can have an impact on kids, which is why some people are trying to censor libraries due to concerns about what their children are reading and how they've been behaving. I disagree with censoring libraries. Instead of removing books, perhaps a section for explicit content, accessible only to older individuals, could prevent young children from accessing them.  Instead of removing all books, consider creating an age-restricted section at the back of the library, requiring staff to confirm the reader's age. This would allow the library to retain its entire collection, satisfy its patrons, and, most importantly, reassure parents.  Another reason to avoid censorship is the potential decline in library users. This would displease patrons and diminish the library's popularity due to a lack of desired reading material.  I understand the concern that certain books may influence children's behavior, prompting censorship efforts. However, it would be preferable to avoid censorship altogether to keep readers happy.  In conclusion, I oppose library censorship because it would alienate readers and likely decrease the library's popularity and visitation rates; therefore, those who agree should take action to preserve libraries as they are.
1540	4517	2	3	The @CAPS1 on Books In the world today, everything is showed every place you look. Libraries are used by many people; people go there to research, study, and even just to find an interesting book to read. One of the problems that some people are having is the exposing of personal things. I believe that libraries should have a censorship. Why should libraries have one? Here are my reasons why. One reason why censorships in libraries are a smart idea is younger children search for books there. A library having books that are not right for children will lead to problems. Any parent would tell you that they would strongly dislike the idea of their child reading something very detailed and adult like. A library should be a place where children, young adults and senior citizens can go to escape from reality not somewhere were they are worried about what book they might pull out from the shelf. If libraries still want to keep certain books in stock, they should start an age limit on those books. Limiting the age on books will stop younger audiences from viewing them. Another thing they could do with the age limiting is parents could set the age limit with the library on when their child should be allowed to view certain books. Also, another way that would help stop offensive viewing is parents looking at what their children are reading, watching and listening to. Parents could help by keeping an eye on what their child is doing and guiding them toward age-appropriate material. Censorships are a wonderful way of stopping the viewing of adult like issues. More public places should start a system of them. The world needs to understand that some audiences aren't ready for reality just yet, and censorship in libraries can help protect them.
1541	4518	2	3	Libraries across the world contain all kinds of books, some good and some bad. There's always going to be something in a book that might offend the reader or someone close to the reader in @MONTH1. It just depends how sensitive people are. The main reason people want to ban books or have them removed from libraries is because of racial slurs, religion, and sexual content.  I think it should be the library's choice to either put the book on the shelf or to take it down. Magazines are an issue along with movies and different kinds of music. According to some, libraries are just trashed with vulgar, racial, or bad movies, books, etc. If parents are scared of their children being able to rent these things, they need to put some sort of block on them. If you want to rent questionable material, you should have to have parental permission.  Taking all of these things out of the library is not a solution. All it does is create anger and leads to lawsuits and more. The library needs to make sections of different rated books so that kids won't be able to get the 'bad' books in their hands. A lot of the books in libraries have meaning, even if the book uses foul language or hate, etc. It shows the mood of the story or how the character really feels inside. If stories like '@CAPS1 in The @CAPS2' didn't have anger, emotion, or the passion it has, it would be a boring book. Authors put language, sexual content, and violence in books, movies, and magazines to entertain certain crowds, and taking these things away would deprive certain people of entertainment they have enjoyed or might enjoy. Therefore, libraries should strive to balance access to diverse materials with parental concerns, rather than resorting to censorship.
1542	4519	2	3	@CAPS1 @CAPS1 a day where there are no books in the school library. A librarian walks through the now empty corridors, reminiscing of the days before censoring, before everyone told her of what they found offensive. Everyone's ideas are different, but that absolutely does not mean they should have everyone else comply. Saying such, if someone finds a book offensive, they just should not pick it up. Just don't read it! By pushing to have the book taken out, they would be implying that they know best, and usually, they don't know best. A @CAPS2 mother could be offended by a fashion magazine in the library @LOCATION1 near the school that simply has an advertisement for a body wash. She @MONTH1 may say something like '@CAPS3 My child shouldn't see things like this,' then demand it be taken out of the library. Does that make sense? I didn't think so either. In addition, if one woman was able to take a magazine out of the library, then another man or woman would believe they had the same power. Censoring could become a casual thing, and books could be thrown out daily! Now, that's only on a small scale. @CAPS1 imagine if they actually took this up with higher authorities. That book would be taken away from all schools in the @LOCATION1 area. This brings us to this problem. Should we, as people, as normal citizens, really decide what others are able to read? The answer to that is a definite no. Let's look on the other end of this now, too. What will happen to the authors who wrote the books that are now banned? As an example, I'll use @PERSON1 J.K. Rowling. What would happen to her if the series '@CAPS4 Harry @CAPS5 Potter' were banned from schools? Also, what about the kids that like to read? This is just taking good books away from the students...Because someone didn't believe in magic and threw a fit about it. That librarian from the beginning is leaving now, there's no more books to check out, bring back, or read anymore. The kids have to go to a public library to get all the books they want to read, and are then still discouraged from reading because the material wasn't proper. This shouldn't happen. Books do not need to be censored, and people who have a problem with a book just shouldn't ruin it for everybody. Therefore, it is essential to preserve the freedom of reading and resist censorship, allowing individuals to choose what they consume without imposing personal preferences on others.
1543	4520	2	3	Censorship Should certain materials (books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,) be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I think it depends on how offensive the material actually is. If it is something very provacative or racist or advanced beyond the years of the people who have access to it, then it shouldn't be allowed. Or, the materials should be restricted or placed in a special section that only certain people have access to. It depends on the level of intelligence, maturity, and age of the people who have access to these materials.  I don't think these materials should be removed, but restricted. Some of it should be left up to the school or library, but it is also a responsibility of the parents. If a child has permission to access a certain material, then they should be allowed to if their guardian thinks it is appropriate. Sometimes the guardians views may not be the same as a the library or schools, but it's mostly up to the guardian. Schools and libraries can't really argue with people's morals or intelligence.  Over all, I don't think materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed unless it has been deemed necessary by a group of people that includes parents, teachers and/or school board memebers, and/or library staff. Just because one mom thinks a book is innapropriate for her child, doesn't mean it should be banned from another. Everyone has a different opinion and idea of what's acceptable, therefore it isn't fair for everyone to have to go by the idea of only one person.  If you don't want your child to have access to a certain material, then simply don't let them access it. If you think it's not an appropriate material for any child to access, you can express that, but others may not agree. Materials considered innapropriate by a respectable group should be restricted or have a warning on them, but not a ban. Therefore, a balanced approach that respects individual choice while acknowledging community concerns is the most reasonable way to handle potentially offensive content.
1544	4521	2	3	If you found a movie that you really enjoyed at the library, would you get mad if the library just took it away and there was no other place to get it? If one person doesn't like something they see at the library doesn't mean it's not educational, and just get rid of it. Just because somebody doesn't like the one thing doesn't mean another person will. I don't think they should get rid of movies, music, books, or magazines just because of one person. Movies are good for visual aids; some people are better learners if they visualize something, getting a better understanding of the purpose or the cause of a situation and they might learn faster. Also, movies show you things that you wouldn't be able to see if you were just reading a book. When people are in movies it's like you are actually talking to them like me and the actor are really having a conversation. When you look at a movie it gives you a visual picture of what's going on, even if the content isn't appropriate. That's why I think that movies shouldn't be taken away because someone thinks that the movies are vulgar and not censored.  Music is another thing that they shouldn't get rid of. Music is almost the only thing you can calm you down so that you can focus again. Also, music soothes the mind so that you can relax and you won't bother anybody else. When you listen to music, it blocks out other sounds that you might get distracted from.  Magazines and books are the basics of a library. If you get rid of those, then it wouldn't be a library anymore. Books are the basic learning methods of education, and people learn the most information out of a book or magazine. If you take those away it's like you're trying to hold people back from education and knowledge. So if you get rid of magazines and books then it wouldn't even be a library any more.  If you get rid of movies from the library then people won't be able to have a visual aid as their alternative way of learning. If you get rid of music from the library, you won't be able to concentrate as well on one thing if you're constantly getting disturbed by other noise around you. Last but not least if you get rid of books from the library then it would not be a library anymore it will just be a place to go like any other place. The library wouldn't be anything any more. So, removing these resources would fundamentally change the library and diminish its educational value for everyone.
1545	4522	2	3	I'm a lot of things, but surely not a reader. But I do believe that you should be able to publish anything that you want over any topic, whether that be a graphic novel or a diary magazine. Nothing should be taken off the shelf for being offensive; if it offends you, don't pick it up or, much less, read it. Say I wanted to write a book but people say it was too disgusting, I would still be able to write it and sell it. Anything that anyone has a problem with, they try to ban or get rid of it. Instead, why don't they just get over it? We have rights, every individual person from me to you, we all have them and should be able to use them to the full extent of what they can be used for. Call me old-fashioned, but I believe in freedom of speech and the freedoms that we have lost soldiers over and the freedoms we have every single day we live. I think drinking every day of the week is wrong, but you don't see me on the news yelling about it; no, I deal with it just like people should deal with the things they don't like. So I hope in this essay I've made good points in making sacrifices and dealing with things and not acting on something you shouldn't be able to change; this approach, I feel, is better than trying to censor expression. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
1546	4523	2	3	Libraries are filled with books, magazines, music, movies, and many more materials. All of the materials cover a really wide range of topics. For example, movies can be a comedy, mystery, or adventure. However, some of this material is not suitable for some viewers and can be very offensive to them. For this reason, these offensive materials should be removed from libraries. One reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because it can lead to violence in teenagers. If a teenager is continually reading books or watching movies that have violence in them, then they might think violent behavior is all right. They might not know that violence is not the answer to many problems, and they will not realize that there are other solutions to a problem. One case that proves seeing offensive material can lead to violence occurred in a high school. A straight-A student got a grade she thought she did not deserve from a teacher. This student then painted her face white, put on red lipstick, and took a knife to the teacher's classroom during school. She then proceded to threaten to kill the teacher. She got the idea from the movie 'Joker', and her costume resembled the Joker. Some students in the classroom at the time called 911, and the police officers convinced the girl to put down the knife. Maybe if she had not seen the movie she would not have threatened to kill her teacher. Another reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because the material is sometimes inappropriate for younger children. The children might just be looking at books and magazines in the library and not even check it out. This way no one will know that they read it. Some of the books in libraries have subjects like sex and drugs in them. When the child reads this, he might want to do everything that is in the book. I have read a book that contains sex and drugs. The book might put awful ideas into the child's head if he read it. After all is said and done, offensive material should be removed from libraries. The material can lead to violent acts in people, even if it does not seem like that kind of behavior could possibly come out of that person. The material can also be inappropriate for younger children. All in all, material in libraries can be offensive to some people; therefore, libraries should prioritize providing resources that are appropriate and beneficial for everyone in the community.
1547	4524	2	3	Libraries have all kinds of books. Books for everyone. I think libraries shouldn't have to take books out because some people don't like it, or find it offensive, when others might like the author. If there is a book in the library that you find displeasing simply don't check it out, just put it back on the shelf and go on with your day. Like author Katherine Paterson said, if we start taking books off the shelves then there won't be any books left to read. Yes, there are books out there that are not meant for little kids and some adults, but that's why you don't let them check them out till you think they are old enough. Just because you don't like the book doesn't mean no one else likes it. Everyone has their own taste in reading, as everything else. People have different backgrounds and preferences.  Libraries have sections for all ages, with books for their age. Like the children's section is for little kids, and the adult section is for adults. Little kids shouldn't be checking out books from the adult section. Parents should take responsibility over their kids and watch what they're doing. Then we wouldn't have to worry about what they are reading, watching, or listening to. Parental guidance can help ensure children are exposed to age-appropriate content.  The libraries are doing just fine the way they are, and have been for years, and will for years to come. So no libraries should have to take certain books off the shelves just because someone doesn't like it, or want their kid reading it. Just ignore that the book is even there and find another one that fits your liking. People learn a lot from books, so if we get rid of most of them what will we learn from then? Books are a great part of history. Why get rid of your history? It's just wrong. Books should stay right where they are and belong, allowing diverse perspectives and knowledge to remain accessible for all who seek them.
1548	4525	2	3	Libraries have books that are short, long, and everything in between. There are good and bad books, but that all depends on the opinion of the reader. There is no reason that if someone is offended by a book in a library that it should be removed from the shelf. The books on a shelf in the library are there for everyone to read, so if one is removed then someone else is missing the chance to have the experience of reading that very book. Would you have some food destroyed if it didn't taste any good to you? No, you wouldn't get it again. So why would someone have the right to remove a book because they were offended; it isn't right; your views on something are only an opinion, nothing more. Your views are not the same as @PERSON1's who lives down the street, so by removing a book it is pushing your views on someone else. Remember that libraries house a wide variety of perspectives and ideas for the benefit of all. In conclusion, the books in question could be good or bad in the eyes of the next person to read it. Pushy people aren't normally liked by others. Books are meant to be read and interpreted by the reader, and that is why no one person has the right to take it off the shelf.
1549	4526	2	3	Everyone in the world has an opinion, some people @MONTH1 find them offensive but there are also people who find it interesting and enjoy reading, listening, and watching the material. I personally have never had this kind of problem; I have only been to the library around @NUM1 times, I generally rent movies. There are people who cannot deal with certain things like blood and guts or racism in books, movies, and music, but at the same time, there are people who absolutely love it; it's their thing.  I believe that it would be wrong to strip those of what they find interesting, what they enjoy to read or watch and listen to. Some people will say well it's vulgar, while other people will say that it's a masterpiece or that what they are into is dull and has no interesting moral. Libraries generally do not have things that are too gory or things that have too much sexual content; they might in books but not movies or magazines. Now music nowadays can be downright vulgar and disrespectful; it can also be very sexual and contain lots of gang-related violence, which has become a large problem with our children.  Libraries generally have old school music like Michael Jackson, The @CAPS1, and slow jams like @CAPS2-kelly, and old smooth positive rap, good old country music, and nice soothing jazz. The music our children listen to nowadays has all of these depressing & violent morals that do not need to be shared with some of these young and imitative minds. I believe that they should not pull it off the shelves, but I do believe that you should have to be a certain age to access these things, ensuring that younger audiences are somewhat shielded from potentially harmful content while still allowing adults the freedom to explore diverse viewpoints.
1550	4527	2	3	Today it seems as if anything you could imagine is out in the world somewhere, somehow. Whether it is found in a magazine, a book, music, or movies is irrelevant. The fact of the matter is, if good stuff is out there, then you can generally make the assumption that bad stuff is out there too. This bad stuff is sitting around on the shelves of our libraries nationwide waiting for someone to open it up and indulge in their naughty, intense, or graphic ways. As an AMERICAN, every man has the right to do or read what he wants. But what happens if it is not a man at all but in fact it is a child? This child is not choosing to read such bad things but just so happens to stumble upon it. Should they be punished for accidentally coming across this material and reading it? Which raises the question; who is to blame, and, what is the solution? It is a good and respectable idea to censor certain things in libraries but if someone wants to read something, they should be able to right? It is a very sticky situation and determining the answer should be a long and thought out process examining the issue from all angles, and different perspectives. The people that have brought this issue to the surface more than likely have personal experiences that make them feel so strongly on their views of censorship in libraries, as have I. On a dry, blistering SUMMER day I wanted to find something to do indoors. So instead of staying home all day I walked down to the library. I had been there a lot that SUMMER and I was pretty familiar with their selection so I was looking for something new. So I strayed out of the kid section and browsed other areas of the library. There were so many choices and options right at the tip of my fingers. I got tired of reading all the titles so I did what generally any other kid would do, and something parents have been telling their kids for centuries not to do; I judged the books by their covers. I found one that looked interesting, and long story short I just so happened to stumble upon a love story. But not the kind I was used to. It was an adult book and want into vivid detail about the relationship of a sexually active older couple. Needless to say I was speechless. Reading that stuff as a child, scared me very much so. Nevertheless it leads me to believe that it would be smart for censorship to be put into place in libraries. Of course, not every kid is going to have the same experience I did. In fact hardly any will. But I know that I was traumatized. So I can easily imagine how other people felt when the same thing or a relatively similar thing happened to them. But for all the other people that have not had things happen to them or that have not stumbled upon such material would probably think that it is unfair that things should be taken away from them just because other people could not handle it. But if you were like me, or any other innocent child that happened to find and experience certain things they just were not ready for would you not agree that censoring libraries is a beneficial thing to everyone? If you want things that are more intense or out there, then you can go to a bookstore, instead of a public library. I am a teenager and I do not have children but I can only imagine how you mothers and fathers out there would feel if it was their kids who were emotionally scarred from experiences they could have been shielded from in the first place. Kids should be kids and not have to be worried about the bad things in this world, and the most efficient way to keep that the way it is, is to censor books, music, magazines and movies from the shelves of public libraries, ensuring a safer and more appropriate environment for young, impressionable minds.
1551	4528	2	3	Everyday hundreds of people visit your local library. The library offers an array of things such as books, music, movies, magazines and newspapers, but what 'limits' does the library have about the content of those things? All sorts of people go to the library. I go to the library, you go to the library, moms, dads, aunts, uncles, siblings, we all go to the library at one time in our life. Different crowds of people have different interests that *might* offend others. The question is, should we limit or rule out certain subjects in libraries? Limiting or censoring the mass media we have in our libraries would nearly empty them. Truth is, someone, somewhere is going to take offense to the items in most libraries; you can never please everyone. Also, some of these topics could be used for educational purposes. Take anatomy books for example. While high school and college students use these books and diagrams to study, some mothers may find them inappropriate for their young children to see. This is why libraries have separate sections for different audiences. There could be a children's section, a 'tween' section, and an adult section to help with this issue. Also, everyone has different interests. I, personally, cannot stand rap music but my sister loves it. Even though I find some of the things they say in those songs offensive it is my choice to listen to it or not. The songwriters, singers, publishers, and authors who write this material have the freedom to do so. Who are we to tell them they can't write about sex, drugs or murder because, face it, those things are part of our day to day lives. If children aren't seeing these things in libraries, they will eventually come across them elsewhere. Should we remove 'offensive' material from libraries? No. If we do that there will be no books to read, no movies to watch or music to listen to because everyone will take offense to something, and restricting access based on subjective offense undermines the library's core purpose of providing diverse resources and fostering intellectual freedom.
1552	4529	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Newspaper @CAPS4, the article that you wrote last week really got to me. The one about whether certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive to some people. I went back and forth on this, first I was thinking that if it was offensive to some people then we should take it down because if it offends people then why are we selling it to the people, but then I got to thinking again and I was like people have the right to freedom of speech and if this how they want to talk then let them speak their mind. This great country of ours was made on the right that every one is created equal and every one entitled to the freedom of speech. If people want to talk like they do in their music or act the way they want to in their movies its their life if you don't like it don't buy it or even pay an attention to it. Say if I was a rapper like Lil Wayne or someone like that I wouldn't care about the people who are talking the way they are because it is my way of telling the world how I feel about things that are on my mind. If someone writes something in a book that you don't like don't go all out and go on TV shows to make fun or tell how you feel write a letter to the author and tell them how you feel about the topic. Every person black, white, yellow, brown, or even green has the right to freedom of speech. It was given to us for a reason and I think it was for that even if you have an idea but you think it is stupid just say it because some people think that is amazing or not. Ultimately, everyone is created equal so treat people the way you want to be treated. I would like to thank you for reading this. Your article really opened my eyes to the world and how I should see it. Thank you for writing it, as it has helped me solidify my views on freedom of expression. Sincerely, @PERSON1
1553	4530	2	3	I think that this kind of books they maybe sometimes offend some people depending on what kind or type of book, magazine, movie, or music they don't want to see there. People agree and disagree on this because some things aren't bad for kids, like age-appropriate games or music, or topics like animals and cultures. However, I disagree with books, music, magazines, or even movies that contain sexual harassment being in a library. I think that type of stuff can be dangerous or offensive for some parents and people, with or without kids. If they are in some libraries, I agree that they need to be removed because people don't want kids to be disrespectful and learn things that don't align with their education or age. I also disagree with music where artists are talking about drugs, gangs, narcotráfic, and even sex. I know this because sometimes I hear this on the radio, and it influences kids to go in another direction in their lives. As parents, we don't want that for our kids; we want them to have a good and successful future and give the same example to their kids when they grow up and become parents, and they are going to see what we are talking about. I have seen it, and in parts of the world, people are being killed or killing innocent people because of drugs; they are selling drugs and making money while hurting other people or kids who consume these drugs. Sometimes, if they don't pay the money they need to pay, they kill them or the police are trying to find them because they are doing bad things. I hope that artists or people who put this in the libraries think first that maybe they are doing something wrong or stuff that they are thinking is something good. Considering the potential harm, these materials should not be accessible to children, as their presence could have negative consequences on their development and understanding of appropriate behavior.
1554	4531	2	3	Book Censorship Censorship in libraries are a major problem in the @LOCATION1. The question is, 'Should we have a age limit on what people can check out?' Or another question is, '@CAPS1 did they let my child check that out?' @CAPS2 are very commonly asked questions, and should have attention put toward them. In my opinion, books should have a age limit on them. My reasoning is because, kids under @NUM1 years of age should have a place where they can find good books for their age group. There are plenty of books out there for all age groups. A kid under @NUM1, should not be able to check out a book, magazine, movie, or music that has offensive language, racial slurs, or dirty behavior from the character, or artist. Another reason @CAPS1 libraries should have a age limit on things you can check out, is because kids can get the wrong idea. Lets say, a book has a statement in it that says '@CAPS3, I went to my bestfriend's house and drank alcohol.' @CAPS4 would be something that a child should not able able to read. It would give the child the wrong idea in what they 'could' be doing. The age limits for book shelves should be as followed:@CAPS5 @NUM3 @NUM4 @NUM5 @NUM6 @NUM1-@CAPS6 @CAPS7 the books in @CAPS2 age groups would probably help stop the refrain on parents worrying about what their kid is reading. Plus, it would help the kid in deciding on what to read. I really think that @CAPS7 books in @CAPS2 age groups, will stop the commotion. Censorship is a major problem in the @LOCATION1. With everything I have listed, I am pretty sure that the questions, 'Should we have a age limit on what people can check out?' and '@CAPS1 did they let my child check that out?' with be answered. Age groups on books, is a great idea and would alleviate many concerns regarding inappropriate content.
1555	4532	2	3	There are books up and down the shelves in the library that sometimes make people wonder why they are up there. People sometimes stand there and stare at a book and ask themselves, 'Why in the world is this book here?' What many people sometimes do not know is that every book is in the world for a reason. Books published are in the world to teach about history, manners, literature, or they could be made to take you on an advantage. Of course you sometimes come across a book that sometimes be offensive to someone, maybe even yourself, but it is there for a reason. I once read a book that I found in our school library that was about slavery. It was a first person novel about a boy who was taken away from his family after being sold to a different plantation owner. Now some people would have been very offended by this book, because the characters were calling the slaves all those names that the slaves do not like to be called. But that book helps people realize how much pain that slavery put on people. People can go to any library, from one in an elementary school to a public library, and you will always find at least one book about the Holocaust. Just about everyone would get offended by one of these books, because nobody liked or does like Hitler, but they have to be there because of history. People can not just take the books out because it offends so many people. That would be like taking the Holocaust out of history, and that just can not happen. If it happened, it happened, and people have to know. Whether people admit it or not, they have ran into at least one book that has offended them. That will happen, it is almost natural for it to happen. But it would also offend people if you took books off the shelf. Those people know that books teach us, and we need books to know what is possible, what happened, and what might happen. Books are here for a reason, and they need to stay, as they provide essential knowledge and perspectives that shape our understanding of the world.
1556	4533	2	3	I believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed if they are offensive to others because censorship is wrong, and libraries have the right to curate their collections. Yes, you @MONTH1 say that some things are inappropriate for children to see, but there is a dedicated children's section in every library so that children won't be exposed to inappropriate content. I feel as though no one has the right to dictate to another store where to locate its merchandise. Also, I can understand where the author is coming from, but you have to understand that there are people out there in the @LOCATION1 who want to read or listen to material that parents might deem inappropriate for their children. I would also suggest that @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 simply don't let their child or children attend that library or that certain place where you know there are despicable materials there. Everyone has the personal right to place their belongings where they choose. There are many other options; @CAPS2 can order books online or go to the library with their child and monitor their selections. When I was a young girl, my mom never let me go anywhere alone, so I never had to worry about seeing anything inappropriate or offensive. Now a days in @DATE1 children generally know right from wrong. Children know what they are supposed to read and what they aren't. I do also agree that if a librarian or an adult sees or hears children looking at or listening to something they know they shouldn't be, they should stop the child or confiscate the item from the premises. So, no, I do not agree with you. I still think that people should have the right to place their things where they want because it is their stuff and their property, and they should be able to make their own decisions about it.
1557	4534	2	3	Have you ever just read a book or a magazine that you just despised and thought that if that book was taken off of the shelf then it would save many people from a waste of time? Or have you ever read a book or heard a song that was not offensive to you, but to other people it might be offensive to their race or gender? A lot of people run into this problem and personally, I have ran into that problem, but that doesn't mean it needs to be taken off of the shelf. If everybody in the world goes to a library and grabs one book off of their own local library shelf to go and throw away, just one, that they absolutely despise because of their own personal reason or just because they didn't like it, there would barely be any books left! If somebody has a problem with the material in a book, magazine, or song, then don't read it or listen to it. Other people might like reading about that topic, or like that kind of music. I understand that some books might be offensive to some people, but do not read it if you take it to offense. Books about slavery might be offensive to some people, but that is history and some people might like learning about that subject, or might even need that information for a research project. There are also many books on the Holocaust, some people might find that offensive, or might not want their kids reading about that, but that is history. It's a time period in the past and it might be something a high school student is doing a research paper over. I have done a research paper over the Holocaust and I have read some very mature material that younger kids might not need to learn about right now, but I would not suggest to take every book over the Holocaust off of the shelves at our local library. There are many different reasons for reading a book and if you want to read a book for enjoyment and you end up reading one that you find offensive, then choose a different topic to read about because some people might like reading about that topic. Just because a person doesn't like a book or the topic the book covers does not give anyone the right to take the book off of the shelf because they feel that it is sending a bad message to younger kids or might be offending to some people. If people do not want their kids reading about that topic then tell them when they go to check a book out at the library not to get a book over that topic. If it becomes too big of a deal to where people begin to find a lot of books that offend them or other people, then suggest for the library to have a list of the books and their topics. Each library could be required to have a list of books, and have the suggested age of the readers beside it, or there could be different sections of the library. One section for kids, one section for teenagers, one section for adults, and one section for middle aged people. Also, if it absolutely needs to happen, each library can have computers to where you can look up the book and see what that book is about. This will give you an idea of what the book is about before you read it so if there is a certain topic that offends you then you can go ahead and find another book and find out what that one is about. This would help many people not read books that offend them and it would help them find a book that is more suitable for what they want to read about. Songs are a whole other subject. An artist or songwriter will write, rap, and sing songs about what they want. If people find the profanity in the song offensive, then do not listen to it. There is no way that you can tell a song writer not to sing or rap about what they want, and stores are going to sell albums that give them business. If people do not want their kids around that kind of language or message that the song is giving off then they can just tell their kids not to listen to it, because artists are going to write songs, rap songs, and sing songs about what is going to make them money, and that is just a fact. The world is a diverse place with diverse interests, and we should respect people's choices in reading and listening materials without resorting to censorship, trusting individuals to make their own decisions.
1558	4535	2	3	The books, magazines, music, and movies shouldn't be removed from the shelves. They still have good information that someone other than you @MONTH1 want to know. If you take them off of the shelves the people that want to use them don't have the opportunity. If you remove books then if someone needs one for a reseach paper that they have to do they will not have the nessisary resouces to do the paper, and at the same time the person with the paper @MONTH1 feel that the non-educational books need to come off the shelves and then that person wont have the books that they want. If they want the book taken off of the shelf, because of inopropriate language or nudity then the libraries can make a spot that you have to be a certain age to access them. I wasw at the library and there was a woman getting upset, because her son had a movie and book that she didn't think was good for him to have. The, book and the movie, that he had were in a different area so that minors weren't suposed to get them. So the woman would be the one that would probibly want to take them off of the shelves, but it wasn't the libraries fualt that he wasn't where he was supposed to be. The products should stay on the shelves, because someone needs it for something or it wouldn't have been there in the first place. If they take the products down that certain people don't like then the people that do like it will not have it. If there are resons that people must have the product off of a shelf then the product should go somewhere else that can be accessed by the people that do want to you the products. The products should stay on the shelves so that the people who need, or just want to use the products can use the products, emphasizing the importance of maintaining access and availability for all who seek these resources.
1559	4536	2	3	To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3: Censorship, does @CAPS2 deserve a place in our society? There has been much contreversy over this topic. Some claim that certain kinds of literature and music contain offensive lyrics or writings, while others, over the same topic, believe the complete opposite. They believe that the words of the artists and authors shows feelings and have messages hidden within words of vulgarity, which is where i stand on the situation. @CAPS2 seems as though everytime we cross over this bridge, @CAPS2 comes right back in front of us. Many of those opposed to the freedom of writing and music are usually the ones that feel as if they must preform proper edicate and have everyone act nothing less of the same, unfortunately for many, the people that are like this, usually, have much power in the say of what comes and what goes, not allowing many of us lower graded people in society to get a chance to veto their poor outlook on things. My opinions bring me to believe that there are two sides to this story too. However, I still believe that much of what is considered 'censored' material should not be censored at all. There is one, count that, one situation where I feel censorship is necessary. One is songs that go on for @NUM1 and a half minutes saying nothing but '*bleep* this, and *bleep that'. All other material, whether @CAPS2 be @CAPS4 rapping or @PERSON1 writing, is acceptable. There's just many people in the world who need to grow up and listen to the lyrics/words, to get the full message before automatically assuming that there is a problem with @CAPS2. Great @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION1, he always has a message in his music, whether @CAPS2 be about family or just life in general, however many words he uses are considered unfit for our time, so you just hear '*bleep*' when @CAPS2 is on the radio. By just that '*bleep*', you can lose the message thats coming across. Also, ever hear the phrase, 'equal rights'? Well, shouldn't music and literature be a right? @CAPS2's just like talking but with either pages or instruments. And that's how I will leave you on this debateable topic. I hope I might have changed some opinions of you today, if not then your loss. Thank you for your time. A @CAPS6 to the @CAPS7, @LOCATION1.
1560	4537	2	3	Everybody had their favorite movie, song, or book when they were younger. Sometimes these types of media aren't exactly child friendly. Songs today hint at sexual activities. Books about scary vampires and werewolves are being published. There are even movies that depict violent and inappropriate behaviors in which children should not witness. Does that mean they should be limited by a public place, such as a library? Several people would agree, but I disagree. Growing up, @PERSON1 was the wonder of my world. Her music was fun and upbeat, making a sunny day even more enjoyable. Her lyrics seemed like they meant nothing, until you thought about it a little more deeply. Even looking at the music videos, they show actions and images little children shouldn't be copying. Some @MONTH1 restrict their child from such material, but I would call that depriving a child of their freedom. You can go to any public library and look through numerous selections of books, dvd's, cd's, and even magazines. Some library's even have computers available to the public. Not all places will carry your favorite artist, movies, or reading material though because they believe it isn't something little children should be indulging in. Who is to say a little kid can't enjoy the material that they'd like? That's like taking away part of a person's originality. A child would not have the opportunity to become an individual with their own opinions and feelings if they were restricted to a one mind track. Limiting a child's media could benefit them in some way. Restricting time on computers, limiting the amount of hours playing video games or watching television could help teach a child time management skills. Most children will see something interesting and repeat what they learned or share it with an adult and it could get them into trouble. Library's shouldn't have to take the offensive media off the shelves though. Age restrictions on renting those offensive types of materials should be set. Just because a book or movie has language and images that shouldn't be seen by children is made, does not mean a library should limit that access to the public. Restrictions on renting that material could be set, which would solve all issues, in my opinion. In conclusion, censorship in public library's could be beneficial, but they should just set an age renting limit instead of removing all material altogether, making parents happier and not restricting a person's freedom to develop their own opinions and liking's of the different types of media.
1561	4538	2	3	Do you believe in hiding books and movies that are over PG-13? Do you think that children can control themselves with offensive behavior? Have you ever seen a child watch a scary movie that was inappropriate, too violent, or overly suggestive? Why do you think that most parents block that kind of viewing from their young children? I believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves from children, if they are found offensive.  I fully agree with adults not letting children watch that new scary movie or that action book their brother is reading. I think they should consider the effects that come with watching or reading certain things. Children at young ages still have their innocence. You don't want your child having nightmares because you let them watch a over PG-13 rating movie. You would feel guilty if the child has problems for the rest of their life.  You have to make a choice on whether the it's comfortable for them to view what their watching or reading! It's important to hid them so the child can not get ahold to them. Be wise of the kind of movies and books you leave around the library. You should have a section for children in libraries. You should have all the materials that a child should be interested in. It should be colorful and playful as possible.  I used to watch this girl named Sarah. I was babysitting her one night, while her parents were at the movies. I brung a movie to watch, when Sarah fell asleep. So once the clock turned to 10 PM, I put her to sleep. But little did I know she woke up and caught me watching this horror film called Nightmare on Elm Street. It gushed blood everywhere and she started to sceam! I thought I had secured her in her bedroom, to go to sleep but to my surprise she was still woke! I rushed over to her and put her back to sleep. hoping she didn't have any nightmares.  Please be curtious to the things youlet children read or see. You have to think of the effects of what's going to happen to the child later in life. I know you think that it's not that harmful to children, but it can really mess up their minds and actions forever. So I hope I have persuaded you to follow my advice and pull them over PG-13 movies and books off the shelves for the safety of the children. It is important to prioritize children's well-being by carefully curating the content they access.
1562	4539	2	3	Everyone is DIFFERENT. Every person is DIFFERENT, this much we can agree on. So why then would people try to put a censorship on books, movies, magazines, and etc., as i pointed out before, we all are DIFFERENT so we all have DIFFERENT standards on what is bad and offensive to what is good. When we remove a book from a library shelve for whatever reason we have to do so then others should have the same right to do so as they see fit. If picked up a book on why CHRISTIANITY is the right religion and i am a JEW then more then likely i will find it offensive. Yet if i gave that same book to a CHRISTIANITY, that person would mostly likely read that exact same book that the JEW read and find it not offensive at all. It all comes down to the veiws we all have about everything so why would you let one person or even a small comittee set standards on library censorship for they JANUARY feel one way while another comittee or person feels completly DIFFERENT. Everyone is DIFFERENT and feels diferently about issuses. There is no way to make sure that EVERY book in the library won't offend a single person. The same issue can be applied to music, movies, magnazines and ect. No matter what we do, some one will be offended. For example, the plege of allegiance is something my school says everyday, yet some people, like a ACLU, find it offensive. All acrosss the nation people say it before school, a sportinh game, or ect., yet you don't see very many people objecting to that. I have obsereved that most people who find it offensive just ignore it so why can't we do the same for books, movies, magazines, and etc. that we JANUARY find offensive. In conclusion, there really is no way to put a cencorship in libraries since no matter to tell what a person might or will find offensive. So why then can't we just not read what offends us, this really is the only way to keep from offending people; therefore, censorship in libraries isn't a workable solution. For these reasons, I feel that there should not be a cencorship in libraries.
1563	4540	2	3	Throughout the history of literature, many books have been banned from public libraries and shelves. They are all somehow offensive to certain people, but not to all. Even some books that include magic and fiction have been expelled from some societies, simply because of certain religions and cultural backgrounds. I believe that there should never be a piece of literature completely banned from public eye. When a book is banned, a piece of history is removed from others' sight. A book that in November have been banned in the 1800s could not have been read by my mother or father. My future children and I could also never be able to read it. Materials that are removed from the public are generally removed because of one specific group which complains about its content. When I was about eight years old, I remember seeing on the news that people in some Middle Eastern countries and other conservative religious countries were burning books from the Harry Potter series, only because it contained magic and ridiculous fiction. Maybe they were being burned because the church looked down upon its story and its fictional stories, but that does not mean it should be banned from the libraries. The Harry Potter series is one of the most popular pieces of literature of my generation, and generations after mine should be able to enjoy it as much as we did. Before the beginning of World War Two, the Jews were starting to be discriminated against. They were treated as sub-humans, like in this example. There was a night in 1938 called Kristallnacht, when radical Nazi and fascist supporters burned Jews' houses, stores, and even books. Some of those books could have been the only copies, yet the government let their hate overcome them and destroyed the pieces of Jewish literature. Because the government found the Jewish work offensive, the generations after World War Two can never read the books burned during Kristallnacht. In Katherine Paterson's quote, she says, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I believe she is correct in this quote. If literature keeps being censored, there will be none left for future generations to enjoy. No literature should be censored, not even the most radical, magical, or fictional. If censorship continues, the future of literature is doomed.
1564	4541	2	3	There are many works out in modern times which can be considered provacative or offensive. Some are even unfit for young eyes. There are many reasons that some will come up with for removing these books from their shelves, but I believe that no one, politician or artist alike, should have the right to put down someone else's work.      There are definitely books in libraries that wouldn't be dreamt of being checked out by the ordinary person, but these books should not be put down. I don't believe that a person's work, which is instilled with hope, money, beliefs, and elbow grease should be removed from public. No matter how offensive or wrong some may be, it is their work and their time, and their heart and soul which they put into a book. It is the truth that this has been done in the past to keep down rebellions and shifts in power, but nevertheless, I still disagree. For example, even today Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf is illegal to even have in Germany. This is for a specific reason, of course, and not a bad one at that, but I believe that this book should still be available so people can read and learn from the past.      As it has been for many centuries, the ability to publish a book means the ability to be remembered forever, and many people put their soul into the book they write. These books represent the ability to think freely, and if one is to remove books from society, then one is to remove free will and free thinking from society as well. This is accentuated especially in the dark psychological science fiction novel by Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451. This book is almost prophetic in the descriptions of future society from the perspective of a person from the 1950's, and almost totally accurate as to what would happen if one was to take books out of society, and was even censored itself for a long time. Of course, it conveys the extremist view of censorship, and probably won't happen in the near future, at least. It is, however, a dark omen of what is to come is censorship is freely given power.      There are many views that one can have on a single topic, book, or idea. That doesn't mean, however, that if it is viewed as wrong it should be put down. This applies to music, movies, magazines, websites, and books alike. If one removes these from society in any form, then at a raw standpoint, they are removing a piece of flavor and individuality from society. If censorship is given free reign, even if it is simply over the 'extremist' or 'radical' ideals, then people will never have the full ability to learn from their mistakes and know what to do about the future, which will simply be history that will be repeating itself. Of course, it is not my viewpoint that governments should simply let terrorists and radicals spread their ideals as they please. Once one is proven to be a threat or menace to the public, then they should most definitely be taken into custody and convicted of their wrongs. There is no doubt in my mind that the law should be upheld, but it should not overextend its boundaries.      Censorship, as a whole, is a helpful process for the benefit of the public, but all in all it removes the ability to see the raw, cold truths of life. This keeps some from ever learning how to be safe truly, and how to think and believe in their ideals. When politicians step into the boundary of art, music, literature, and even education to an extent, and try to keep it from flourishing as it naturally would, then something must be done. I'm not inciting a rebellion, but I truly do not believe that politics should rule over the artistic soul of the average man. That in itself is how society becomes self-destructive and loses its concern and connection with the world, leaving it barren of diverse perspectives and ultimately hindering its potential for growth and understanding.
1565	4542	2	3	Many different people have views on what they want their children to be exposed to, whether it be in books, movies, music, or any other type of media. So should libraries be more strict and remove certain items that might come across as offensive or vulgar to parents or even students? I believe that it completely depends on how a library advertises or who they allow to check out what. I know that a certain case, specific to me, is that my mother did not like me reading a specific series because she thought that it was not an appropriate reading material for me. Because of that, that does not mean she marched down to the library and demand that they get rid of all the books written by that author. She respected the fact that others enjoyed reading the books and just asked me to steer clear of them and to find something more appropriate for me to read. In many libraries, I know that they have certain areas for specific age groups of people like children, teenagers, and adults. Within those specific designated areas, they have kind of 'sub-area' where they seperate educational from entertainment and so on. Let's say one parent gets offended by a specific section, such as a sex education section, should they ask the library to remove it completely? I do not think that will help anything because there are students who use that topic for areas they are studying and parents who use it as educational tools with their own children.  I do believe that libraries should put stamps or notices on their different types of media saying that only a certain age group is aloud to look at them and be able to check them out. An eight year old should not be able to go in and get a R rated movie whenever they want to. There should be restrictions on areas like that, but for someone to come in and say to take out all the R rated movies is a ridiculous thing to do because there are others who enjoy that type of entertainment. Libraries respect the fact that there are different types of people with different interests and they try to make their environment as comfortable for everyone as possible. They will have children's videos seperate from the adult videos and they even have a whole seperate section of books for them to discover and journey into. The only thing that I believe should not be in libraries is vulgar magazines or videos. A library is still a public, family area, after all, and no child should accidentily stumble upon any raunchy article.  So, should libraries completely remove areas of media? I do not think so. I think that they should distinguish from adult's and children's materials. Katherine Paterson says, 'But if I have the right to remove books from the shelf . . . then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we continue to take books off of the shelves then eventually there will be nothing to read. Instead of demanding removal, focusing on appropriate labeling and age restrictions allows libraries to serve diverse needs without sacrificing access to information and entertainment for all.
1566	4543	2	3	People in @MONTH1 have a certain reason to take something off the shelves like books, magazines, @CAPS1, etc. Whether those reasons be personal or professional it is rather important. Some in @MONTH1 find the material offensive to themself. Others might find it inappropriate to have something like that available to the younger generation. And writing or music could be thought of as unnecessary and irrelevant. The world holds many things that can be found offensive to someone. That someone could be an educated person or a high school dropout. Out of all of the stuff in the world someone is going to find something offensive to them or other people. It can be a phrase that an author uses or the name of a song. But to take something away from the people is not right and shouldn't be allowed unless it is highly offensive. They could choose to stay away from that sort of thing. Unless the offender is very public and offends practically everyone, should it then be removed. Other material could just be blatantly inappropriate for some to have access to. If there was a book on how to rob a bank or how to make cocaine then it should be removed because that would cause problems that could have never happened. People might learn how to do those things anyway but by allowing that to be public information would be like starting a fire that will get widely out of hand. Of course, anyone can get the notion to do something from anything they read but that is how they interpret it. Some things out there are just inappropriate for the world and all the people on it. If you listen to a @CAPS2 and the singer or rapper starts using profanity and disrespecting a race or gender when they haven't done anything to anyone it would be unnecessary. Something like that should not be allowed in the first place and it is bad enough to be done to another singer but to talk about a race or culture in inexcusable. Or if a writer writes a story about someone, for example who just recently saved peoples lives, saying they were a horrible person and did terrible things to people when they only a little about the person and heard barely any of the story. In conclusion, in certain instances the people should have the right to take away something that is extremely offensive not just to them but to a large amount of people, or if the material can cause problems that should not have started. And if the writing or music is inappropriate to a race or culture should it be removed. Everyone has their rights and if writing, music, and videos are putting them down they should have the right for it to be taken from access, thereby protecting the vulnerable from undue harm.
1567	4544	2	3	"My opinion on this would be that they are going to learn about adult content anyways, so why take adult content off the shelves? No, I don't think any adult material should be censored. You know when your little girl or boy asks about what they have in their hand, simply just take adult content from them and say, ""your eyes can't handle it."" Eventually, they are going to ask questions, and eventually, they will start to wonder, but they learn that stuff in school anyways, so what's the big deal? If I had a child who had got into my personal stuff and started asking questions, I would simply tell them, ""that's a mommy and daddy thing,"" and then hide adult content in a different place to where I know they can't find it. I mean, when you were a child, of course your parents would have yelled at you for going into their room and looking through their stuff, but then again, you would yell at them for having adult content when they got older. So don't discipline your children for what they 'stumbled' onto, you should learn how to hide your stuff better. I'm not saying I would have any of that stuff (why would I need adult content?), but, as a student looking into the future, I have an opinion. Now let's say that you have a couple of magazines under your bed and your child happens to see them. Eventually, they will start looking at them, and some words might come out, but that does not mean they did anything wrong, it's the parents' fault. Like I said before, I would hide my stuff better but, then again, I don't need that kind of stuff to live a happy life, I have my children and my husband and that is all I'll ever need. So before you parents decide to protest about the library having stuff that children are not supposed to see, check your room, hide your stuff so you won't be the embarrassed one. No, a library can have whatever they want, it's not your place to say what they should get rid of and what should stay. As a student, I stand up and say, No, adult material should not be banned from libraries; then you would hear the adults complaining, and that is something we don't need, as it's a form of censorship that limits access to information and infringes upon intellectual freedom."
1568	4545	2	3	No! By taking away things such as books, music, magazines, or movies off the shelf that someone might deem 'offensive,' you're taking away things that people enjoy. Not many people, including me, would agree with the passage of censorship on items like these. So should we do this? I don't believe that we should. There are many reasons why this should not be passed.  First, by using this censorship, you might lose more customers in that store selling these items. Once the store has lost customers, they lose money, then they might even lose their store. A lot of people like things that don't have any limits to them. They often find their joy in these things. I know that I, myself, like reading books, listening to music that has no limits. So, if you're taking them away or putting limits on it, are people really going to want to have these things?  Secondly, if there is really an issue with books and etc. that are not suitable for kids, then put the books and etc. in categories. These categories would put the things not suitable for children, apart from the ones that children should be reading. Since there are no real solutions besides banning these items, this would be the best plan.  Finally, as Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' If this is really a problem, then the parents need to watch what their child is reading, because it isn't right to have everything taken away from society just because the parents are concerned with what their child is reading.  So what do you think, should this be such a law? The choice is yours. Just remember though, if you agree with this, then just think of everything you are taking away from other people; do you really want to be that heartless? Think carefully about the impact such a decision would have before supporting it.
1569	4546	2	3	Censorship is a matter of great contention today. Many authority figures have seemingly become obsessed with the notion that literature, video games, movies, and music are responsible for the perceived corruption of today's generation. Many believe in the idea of censorship because it will protect their children and allow them to remain innocent and morally upright. However, I believe censorship is a grand mistake on our part. Denying children access to certain literary works only keeps them ignorant, not innocent; so many books today are censored, and yet the information contained in them could have been vital to children who are seeking an understanding of the world they live in.  One of the most difficult questions about censorship is the matter of what should be censored and what should not. Books that are viewed as offensive or controversial are the usual targets, but viewing something as being offensive is just that: a view. It changes from person to person because of varying cultures, religions, and moral codes. No one can agree on what will have a negative impact on children, making it impossible to establish a standard of what is best left off the shelf. The problem this creates is that many valuable books that should be permitted reading material are instead unavailable. Consequently, children miss out on perspectives and narratives that could broaden their understanding of the human experience.  Censorship can protect a child from information they are better off not knowing, but it also robs them of a chance to gain vital knowledge. Children should be encouraged to read and to learn, not blocked from doing so. Yet if this is truly the case, why does the censorship debate still rage?  The argument continues because, in truth, there really are things that ought to be censored. Movies, music, and even books today can be very violent or sexual in nature, and these inappropriate subjects can have a negative impact on youths. Bloody video games and hateful song lyrics can encourage animosity towards others in children. But that cannot be the sole cause of such behavior; children will act right if they are taught how, not if they are hidden away from every instance of wrong. Censorship is greatly inferior to proper life lessons about morality, equality, peace, and respect.  Inevitably, censorship will remain a common practice. But try this: think of a book that changed your life for the better, and then imagine if you had been denied access to reading it. Do you want to let your children miss out on an experience that could very well mean the world to them? It is better to guide them through challenging material and help them develop critical thinking skills than to shield them from the world and potentially deprive them of transformative experiences.
1570	4547	2	3	I do believe that we can have materials because there are some good materials that have some good stuff in them. Books, yes, if we don't have books we can't learn. If we don't have books, how do people know how to read? Music, I will say yes and no, because sometimes music is not good, but sometimes people need music to do their work, to help them focus or relax. I will say no to magazines because there can be too much in them, specifically, there can be stuff within them that children should not see. Therefore, while some materials are beneficial, others may be detrimental.
1571	4548	2	3	No, I don't think that certain books, music, movies, magazines should be taken off the shelves. If stuff like that gets taken off, then there will be nothing good to read. The books nowadays are starting to get good, so if they take the good books, then no one will read. Most people think that rap music is bad, but that is the music that most people listen to nowadays, and most people don't like country. There are some bad movies out there, but they are fun to watch because they are either funny, gross, or they are sad, but these bad movies are gross or funny. If people made better magazines, then they wouldn't have that much money, then that business will go out of business, and that's not a good thing because the person that runs the business will have no money to feed his kids. Since I have been alive, most of the good things like books, music, magazines have changed because people don't like the stuff from a long time ago. If they do it again, then people will stop going to the movies and buying books, so that's what I think.  Now there are a lot of good movies and music coming out, so if they brought back all the stuff they used to have, then people would have more money. Why people would have more money is because more people would go see the movies from back in the old days. So like movies from the 80s and even the 90s would make a lot of money.  So that's why I think they should not take stuff off because that is how we are losing all our money. The people are using the money that they would for movies or books and stuff; they are using it for drugs and other stuff that can get them sent to jail and stuff, which ultimately shows why maintaining a diverse selection of entertainment options is beneficial for society.
1572	4549	2	3	What I believe is that certain material should be allowed on a shelf. The time it takes an author to write a book is very long. It could be their passion to write, so why would you want to take that away? Every person has an opinion, which they are allowed to have by freedom. Material in libraries is sorted by age group, and as long as the material is fitted for that age group, there shouldn't be a problem. There are many books that some people do not want their children to read, but the books actually help children learn. For example, a book that you think is boring could actually be interesting to another person. There are many opinions in the world; that is why there are so many different kinds of books. If you took away a book or certain material off the shelf, how could that help a child? Yes, it could have bad words or beliefs, but it could help someone. If a person is a loner or just likes to be by themselves, they could learn from the character's mistake in the book. Many children these days are getting bullied or picked on and don't want to tell an adult. If there was a book that they read about a person being bullied, maybe it would encourage them to tell a teacher. Yes, I agree every material has something in it that another person does not like. There are a couple of books that I did not approve of, myself, but I know that it has connected with a child somewhere in the world. Every person does not grow up in the same conditions, but material could teach them. You should stop and think if you were a writer, would you want someone to throw your hard work in the trash? Every time there is a big rally about an author writing about a certain belief, there are negative thoughts. No one stops and thinks about someone else or their family. All they care about is their own family. Even the author's family is embarrassed by the rally, but no one stops and thinks of their family and how they feel. These rallies can cause distress and pain for the author and their loved ones. Think about your opinion, does anyone care about what you think? That is why as a person, we should not bring down someone's opinion and let them say what they believe on paper. How would you like it if someone threw your belief or opinion in the trash? If there is a rally about a material in the library, next time think before you judge. Would you want someone judging your belief or opinion? So, we should strive to be more understanding and accepting of diverse perspectives and allow authors to express themselves freely, trusting that readers can make their own informed choices about what they read.
1573	4550	2	3	Alot of things can be found offensive now days, but that does not mean you take it away from others who enjoy it. Everyone has their own view, and opinon on things. For the things people find offensive I believe they should just simply stay away from it. No, I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the library shelves. Somethings people find offensive others might enjoy. Its simple, if it comes to the point were people are causing problems then maybe that will be up to the people that work in the libraries. Yes, there be alot of things that people take offensive, but that dose not mean take away the things others enjoy. I have been to many libraries in my life. I have not really seen anything offensive, but I have seen some books and movies for adults only. Honestly in my eyes its simple, if there is something you find offensive just stay away from it, because others enjoy it. Its not up to me weather the materials should be removed from the library shelves. Although I do believe that people who find things offensive should just stay away from it. You have to take things into consideration before jumping straight into conclusions. Ultimately, the decision rests with those managing the libraries, but personal avoidance is a simple solution for dealing with potentially offensive content.
1574	4551	2	3	Censorship in libraries shouldn't exist because a lot of this stuff is already on TV, like Comedy Central, BET, Adult Swim, MTV, and many other channels. Should music be censored? No, because the blanks can ruin the beats, rhythm, and the lyrics. Censorship ruins how the song goes, and it makes people mad because they like a certain song, but if they want to listen to it uncensored, they have to get on a computer. Websites they can get on to listen to it are Spotify, YouTube, Pandora, and many more. Movies shouldn't be censored either; it's the parents' choice. If they don't want their kids to watch or hear certain things, they shouldn't pick that movie or tell the kids to go to their rooms. Books, I repeat, should not be censored because what if the adults want to read them? That isn't fair for them, because all of this is about kids. Kids are smart about this; they know what to read and what they shouldn't read. TV shows are the best thing ever; there are a lot of shows that are funny, awesome, thriller, and a lot more. But censorship gets to you. Here's an example: BET, Adult Swim, and more play a lot of good movies, but since they block out the words and parts of the movie, it really doesn't make sense to watch it because there are parts they haven't really seen, and they have to go rent it or buy it to see the movie. Am I right? All I am saying is that censorship ruins a lot of TV shows, movies, and music, and nobody wants that. It ruins the entertainment for people, and that's sad to see because actors, music writers, writers, and a lot more spend a lot of their time for the fans and their work, when they could be with their families. Well, this is the end of my essay, and it's clear that censorship ultimately does more harm than good by diminishing the creative works that people enjoy and appreciate.
1575	4552	2	3	There is material out there that some people consider offensive and or have material in them that we don't want our youth to indulge in. Such items can include music, books, and movies, but I am just going to give you some of my thoughts on the issue. On materials, like music and movies, there are ratings on the item saying what age is apropriate for the content that the music or movie have in them. Like movies there are ratings such as R which means that you should be 17 or older to view it. PG which is parental guidance or 13 and up. PG means you should have your parents with for the younger kids. And G which is for all age groups. If there is something offensive and or the language is bad in music the cover will have a lable that says explicit content. I agree with this. I don't think that they should take anything off of the shelf unless completely nescessary. If someone doesn't like the content in that item they have the option to not listen, watch, or read it. There are people out there that might disagree with me and I can see where they are coming from too. Say if there is a book discriminating a race than I agree that it should be taken off the shelves. There are also people out there who are more leanent and others that are more strict. Just like parents for example. A lot of parents want to raise there kids in an envirenment where there is no swearing and violence, while other parents let there kids watch and listen to items out of there age group. Like with me my parents let me watch, read, and listen to what I want and in my opinion I turned out just fine, while others might not thing so. I have seen kids that had parents that weren't strict and let them indulge in these items and they turned out to be well behaved adults. Then there are also people you had strict parents and they turned out to be not so good of a person, and vise versa. That is about all I have to say on the topic. You have seen my views and what I believe. In a summary I guess I could say that everyone has there own opinions and views, and it's up to the individual or their parents to decide what they consume, respecting that varying perspectives on what is appropriate will always exist.
1576	4553	2	3	Have you ever had a book, movie, or magazine offend you? Have you ever wished that no one else will ever have to read it? Should those offensive materials be removed from libraries? I don't think they should. The books, movies, and other materials should be marked saying that they MAY be found offensive. From my own experience I know how easily one can be offended by a book or movie. Many times I have read a book that has completely contradicted my religion. Most times I will ignore it and move on to a better book or movie. Sometimes it is harder to ignore. I always try to forget and move forward with my life, as others should do. Have you ever read the book The BIBLE? If you have you are aware that there are some ideas in this book that bring up many controversies. One example from the book would be when they kill some of the children. Most people, like myself, do not agree with this idea. They think that it is wrong. Again some people MAY try to get this book banned, but it is still a wonderful literature. As you MAY have seen in the media lately, many people are trying to get the book THE MOUSE TRAP removed from schools. Some people have found the book as offensive because it repeatedly refers to native americans by a more profound word. The law has not passed yet and has remained in schools. The law hasn't passed because it does not affect everyone. Some people MAY not find this offensive. Therefore it was not removed. Removing offensive books from libraries is the exact same thing. Some people MAY find the books offensive while others MAY not. Removing the books from everyone's reach would be appauling. The book MAY only be offensive to one race or religion. Why not simply put a warning label for that race or religion? That would take care of the problem by putting the decision of reading it and being offended in their hands. Possibly it isnt that the books are offensive to a race or religion, maybe it is to an age group. If that is the problem then the librarians can put those books in the appropriate age section. I have given reasons from my own experiences, other readings, and my obersavations in the media. I only hope that you consider my ideas. Do not remove the books from the shelf only because it is offensive to one person. Simply put a warning label on the book after a few complaints. This would put the responsibility of being offended in thier hands. Once again I do not think that offensive materials should be removed from our libraries, only censored to the people of whom it is offensive, allowing them to make informed decisions about what they choose to read.
1577	4554	2	3	In @LOCATION1, everyone wants censorship, mainly because they don't want to be the outcast. That's understandable given the numerous different races in @LOCATION1. In some ways, censorship is necessary, while in other ways, some people just want attention. If all different races want censorship, then why would we censor to the liking of just one group of people?  Essentially, the censorship problem won't go away because it is a chain reaction. For example, if a group of people asked a library to get rid of books because of the references they make, that might be insulting to another group of people. Then that group of people wouldn't like a reference to another book, which another group of people dislike, and it goes on and on. So for the censorship towards different groups of people, there will have to be some tolerance.  On the other hand, young children are in need of censorship. They grow and mature everyday, developing physically and mentally. So if we were to put an inappropriate book in front of them, they would read it and accept it as standard. And when they read bad things like that, they develop the wrong goals and values for their future lives.  We are all different and interpret things in different ways. So when you watch a movie or listen to music and think it wrong, someone right around the corner @MONTH1 thinks that it's just normal. If you question someone's movie or song, in the scheme of things, you're questioning their judgment, and that's unfair to them. Therefore, finding a balance between protecting vulnerable groups and respecting individual freedom of expression is crucial for a harmonious society, as unchecked censorship can lead to the suppression of diverse voices and perspectives.
1578	4555	2	3	Books, music, movies, and magazines are all things people use for entertainment and study, something that everyone should have access too. If someone is offended by one of these things I do not think that they should be removed off shelves or advertisements. Many people will still find these books or other resources interesting. If the source is something more adult then it should be placed in a section that is labeled or supported by information that says so. Radio stations play songs that talk about sex, drugs and violence but I believe that kids need to be associated with these things. Parents can't keep their children from it all of there life, and most of the bad things said are cut out. Everyone has a different interest in the things that he or she likes, reflecting diverse perspectives. So why should you pull something off the shelf in stores or libraries just because its offensive to one person, thereby limiting access for others who might value it?
1579	4556	2	3	I do not think libraries should have to censor the kinds of books, magazines, etc..., because people should have the right to read anything that want. People do not necessarily like reading some things, but if it is important that they research something, or read a book for school then they need to have the resources available to them. Take the book, *Lolita* in the *United States*, for example. In that book it describes kidnapping, and the rape of young girls. Certain classes would require you to read this book, even though no one would really want to read about that. Some people have different tastes in movies. Personally, I prefer horror movies (but not gory) because they get me thinking about what's going to happen next. Some people like the really graphic and gory movies, and maybe if the libraries started taking movies like this off the shelf, it would be harder for those people to find them. Certain people would find some things more offensive than other people. Who can say where it should stop? Movies that make fun or talk about religion would be offensive to the people in that religion, but people from other religions would be unaffected by it. Just imagine watching *The Life of Brian* and seeing someone talk about everything you believe in and joking around about it. It would really offend people, while other people couldn't care less. Basically, I think we have the right to read or watch whatever makes us happy, and if there is something out there that you do not want to see, you just have to ignore it and leave it alone. It should not be ruined for other people who would like to see it. Therefore, censorship in libraries is ultimately detrimental to individual freedom and access to diverse perspectives, and we should trust individuals to make their own choices about what they consume.
1580	4557	2	3	Censorship in media has been around since the beginning of the film industry. Some of the first movies were seen as too offensive and never made it to the theatres, but books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries how do they even need to be censored? Censorship of books should be if a book is not for children keep them away from it. Books that are extremely offensive should be taken off the shelf or not put in a library. A library is a place of learning or reading for entertainment and those very offensive books do not teach learning or are entertaining. Music is another thing. Most songs out are highly offensive and should be in a different section. They should not be in the kid's area for music because do parents really want their children to learn cuss words at the age of five? Most parents do not want their children to learn cuss words and probably like if the libraries got rid of the music altogether that had to with sex, drugs, and cussing, all things that are censored in the media today. Maybe libraries can carry music that is censored instead of carrying music that is not censored. Movies are almost the same as music because it potrays mostly what music has in it, but it is visual. Again parents do not want to see drug use or inappropriate gestures that make the child copy what they see and hear. Libraries should put the movies in the adult section of the library. They should be censored by putting a censor bar over the mouth of someone who is cussing or put the bar over the person's hand or wherever when they are making an inappropriate gesture. Over the years it has become harder to censor magazines. Magazines are impossible to censor, unless you are the person receiving the magazine. If you are the libraries receiving the magazines grab a black marker and cross out words or pictures that seem to be offensive. The libraries should not carry the inappropriate magazines. If you are at a library and you see something inappropriate tell the librarian and see if they will censor the material in question. Ultimately, the goal of censoring library materials is to protect children and maintain a learning environment, even if implementing these measures requires constant vigilance and effort.
1581	4558	2	3	Yes, I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Some people do not want to read about those things that they have less interest in. Materials like that can offend many people, so they should be removed from public shelves. For example, someone, by accident, might stumble upon a book containing inappropriate materials. They could take it home and begin reading it, and realize that the material that they are reading contains information that offends them. That really concerns some people and can hurt the library that held the book, and they could begin losing customers. Another reason why inappropriate materials should not be publicly displayed is, children. What if a young child was wondering around a store or a library, and randomly picked up a book or magazine with offensive pictures in it? That young child would see things that were not meant for that child to see. But, it does happen. Imagine how angry the parents of the child would be. They would most likely do everything they could to get those materials removed from being displayed in public and from being within a child's reach. Children definitely do not need to be seeing those things and also, even some adults do not even prefer it. Religion is also an example of why places should watch what they put on their shelves. It could be against some religions to read inappropriate materials. And without them knowing their book contained it and they read it, they would be greatly offended and very upset. That could turn many people away from reading certain books, or even going to the store where they even purchased those materials. In conclusion, all of these are perfect examples of why inappropriate materials should be removed to prevent people from being offended; it's about respecting diverse sensitivities. This is why materials such as books, magazines, etc. should be removed from public shelves, because they can offend many people.
1582	4559	2	3	As Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' As an author, she feels if she, and anyone else, has the right to take those uncensored books off the shelf, then there will be no books left. Depending on the person, some books @MONTH1 may be offensive to some, but not all. I dont think that books should be able to be taken off the shelf by anyone because everyones preference on books can be different. I believe that libraries should keep unsensored books in a certain section, so children can easily be kept from seeing or reading unappropriote material at their age. And lastly, my own experience has led me to believe there should be a warning on certain books, saying not all the material could be appropriote. People having the right to take any book off the shelf would be unfair for the people. The library is a quiet place, meant for people to come and read any type of book, do homework, study groups, and undergo research for practiaclly any topic, @CAPS1 and the number of books based on one persons opinion is unfair to everyone else who might enjoy that genre. Libraries and books were one of the main resources for researching before there was internet and many people still prefer books to this day. I think the freedom of taking any book off the shelf would be endangering the process of learning and discovering.  To reduce the number of uncensored books being found by children or people who find them offensive, there should be a certain section in the library for just those books. That way, people who have an interest in those books can read them, but also they are kept away for those who dont want to read them. I think taking away any type of book is unfair to the people because everyone like different genres of books, so having uncensored books in one section is fair to all. It would also be easier on parents knowing their children wont find books with material in them that they shouldnt be reading.  By disagreeing with the right to take any book off the shelf, I think each book with any uncensored material should be marked with some type of sticker on the binding, just as a warning. If one sees that sticker and knows they dont want books with that type of material, then they can easily return the book with no argument. I have had experience with trying to find a book for a school project, but later finding there was material in it that really wasnt appropriote for school. This made me have to find a new book for the project. I didnt want to completely take the book off the shelf and away from any one else who wanted to read it, but a warning right then would of been easier in the situation.  In conclusion, I dont believe that certain materials should be taken off by just anyone. Taking away books would spark many disagreements because even though one person might find something offensive, doesnt mean every other person will. As mentioned before, putting the uncensored books in a different section and putting a sticker on the binding would give a clear warning to anyone not wanting to read unsencored books. I think every library needs to take into consideration of the topics above to help people reduce the issue of people or children finding uncensored books in just any section, and allow everyone to read the genre of books they prefer.
1583	4560	2	3	I do not really read books. I think that offensive things should be taken off shelves because there could be a scene if they aren't. Some material might genuinely hurt or provoke certain individuals. There are many people who will fight if they are truly offended, and it is not a pretty sight. Therefore, removing potentially inflammatory books could prevent unnecessary conflict and maintain peace.
1584	4561	2	3	I believe if I worked at a library, and found items with profanity, racism, or slang, I would agree with removing magazines, music books, and other books containing such content. I wouldn't want my own children encountering racism or other inappropriate content at the library. My goal would be to encourage library use, but inappropriate books hinder that. If I were tasked with scanning books to ensure their suitability for young adults and children, I would take it seriously. Discovering that my child had brought home an inappropriate book because I hadn't performed a book scan would be upsetting. I would conduct a thorough observation of the library's collection. Libraries should prioritize inspiring books, cartoons, and baby books for young children. If a majority of us found objectionable material, we should have the right to request its removal, protecting not only my children but others as well. I wouldn't allow my child to return until the library was better organized. Libraries should have dedicated spaces for children's books, perhaps even separated by age group, such as one room for baby books and another for 1-2 year olds, and so on. Always read the back of a book before checking it out, because you never know what the books going to be about, and I hope these ideas inspire positive changes, ultimately creating a more welcoming and safe environment for children to explore the world of reading.
1585	4562	2	3	Censorship in libraries has been an issue among communities for as long as literature has been around. As expressed by Katherine Paterson, if one has the right to remove a book from the shelf that he or she deems unacceptable, then everyone has the right to remove books that he or she deems unacceptable. Everyone has an individual view of what is unacceptable, so that would eventually leave no book to be left on the shelf. In saying this, if the government censors materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines, there is nothing to keep them from banning all that is there. There is bound to be someone that wants a certain thing to be censored, but the government might not see it as something to be censored. This brings up another question, what deems something unacceptable to be viewed? In my mind, this is a matter of opinion, so should we leave something like this in the government's hands to decide upon? I do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should ever be censored. It is the choice of the individual to read, listen, or watch a certain material. The government's opinion of whether something should be censored or not has changed over time. The novel, 'The Grapes of Wrath' was once censored and banned by the government for it contained language and scenes that were viewed as inappropriate for readers. If this work were to remain banned, this canon of American culture, the effect that it had on American literature to this day would have been lost. I see literature as another form of art. Art should never be censored, for the lack of it will halt all developments in our society. Artists are ones to take risks and so are writers. If people were not allowed to take risks, what would become of our society? Developments that have been made by researchers, inventors, artists, and writers were once possibly deemed as risk. Should we have censored them? Another instance under which censorship had had a negative affect on society and culture was during the Nazi regime. Music, books, art, movies, everything was censored or banned under Hitler's rule. A whole generation was lost under his power, for they were deemed unacceptable just because he did not like them. Now, should we put the power of picking what is unacceptable into the hands of one group of people? Whole generations of books, music, etc. could be at stake under such principles. There should be no reason that we are not allowed to see, read, or listen to whatever we would like to as a nation. The government, with the ability to censor libraries, can hinder our exposure to ideas unknown to us. Lack of exposure is the cause of a society's ignorance of the world around it. Who will stop the government from censoring what could be the next major masterpiece in literature? Nothing stopped them from banning 'The Grapes of Wrath,' so is there limit? This is the question one has to ask themselves, to keep the government from potentially cutting the nation off from future masterpieces, and to ensure the free flow of information and ideas that are vital to a thriving and informed society.
1586	4563	2	3	There has been a problem with censorship in libraries recently. Many books, movies, and music are being removed from libraries because they are found offensive. There are, however, libraries that do not remove items due to being offensive. There are many reasons as to why items are censored or not censored, but libraries should not have to censor certain items. One reason why offensive material should not be removed is because material that is considered offensive could be given a label that warns people of the material in the book or movie. These labels could detail the specific content that may be objectionable, such as violence or mature themes. If a child tries to check out a book or movie that has a warning label, they would have to have a parent with them to approve the item the child is getting. Whether or not children read or see the offensive material is the decision of the parents. Another reason offensive material should not be removed is because parents would have to approve the item that their child is getting. If they believe the material is too mature for their child, they could restrict them. If the item doesn't seem too harmful, they could allow it. That decision, however, is up to the parents. Books or movies that are considered offensive could also be given their own section of a library. Children would not be allowed in that section without parental supervision. And that, again, is the decision of the child's parents. There are many reasons why offensive material should not be banned. That sort of material, however, should have restrictions on who should and should not check them out, ultimately leaving the decision to parents and upholding intellectual freedom.
1587	4564	2	3	Everyone has their own opinions and arguments about something. There are a lot of books that can be offensive to people in some ways. There can be over thousands of books in a library, and I find it difficult sometimes to find that right book that interests me. My personal opinion is that I do not think that books should be removed from a shelf even though it might offend someone.  As I stated in the first paragraph, everyone has their own opinions. There are so many types of books out there from murder mysteries, romance novels, true crime stories about drugs, and many more. These books should be placed in separate areas just as many books are. If books are taken off a shelf what does that mean to us people? Everyone has their own freedom. So if books are going to be moved because someone is offended, that's taking away from our individual freedom.  There is more to books in a library also. Books, movies, music, magazines, etc., can all have different types to them. I do think they should just be placed in different areas. I can see where people think that this can cause an influence to young children if they pick up something that is disturbing, but they should be with an adult. Adults know what is right from wrong better than children do. For example, whenever I walk into public places I hardly ever see children just running around, especially in libraries. Libraries are expected to be kept quiet and not for jumping around and screaming. The kids should be kept with their parent or an adult that way they can't grab something they shouldn't.  I understand that some teenagers can be offended by drugs or killings in magazines or books, but some people like reading about that kind of stuff. Does that mean we have the right to take it off the shelf because one is offended? Too many think they have the right to do anything without negotiating with others. People that do not like that kind of stuff should just put it back down and go on with what they were doing. I can understand if you think that restrictions should be put on some things because I will agree. There should be sections for teens, adults, and children. To me that does not mean we have to remove anything though from others for offending someone.  Libraries can have an effect on your everyday life because of how calming and soothing it can be. You should be able to have freedom without removing anything from anyone. Taking away things does not mean you're just taking away from one; it means you're taking away from everyone. You can have your own censorship in libraries from your individual freedom. These are my personal views on why things should not be removed from shelves or anything else, allowing everyone to maintain their own choices and avoid imposing personal preferences on others.
1588	4565	2	3	There are lots and lots of arguments over the censorship of books and how they could affect children. Some people think that offensive books should be removed from library shelves. Others think that they should be left up there for the people who want to read them to do so. Some parents of children say that their child has become more offensive towards others, when others people think it is just bad parenting. So, you see that there are many different statements about offensive stuff being told to their children. I think that there are some offensive things that need to be kept on shelves and that there are some that shouldn't. Some articles that are offensive should be left up on shelves because they might teach children of what is bad and what isn't. Other articles that have no reason for being offensive should be taken off shelves. For an example there is music that talks about being extremely harsh and disobedient to others when that person has done nothing harmful. One example of being offensive in a good way is the book '@PERSON1.' @PERSON1's book showed how bad slavery was and how it should never happen again.  If there is a book or any other piece of material that is offensive in a good way; I want to read it and understand what it is trying to portray to me. If it is portraying a bad image, then it should be removed from shelves. If it isn't portraying a bad image then I believe that it should be taught to children so they can understand the affects and know the difference between what is right and wrong. Books that suggest harmful behavior towards anything without a purpose should be thrown away. This is because children that read it could join in on what the book is suggesting. Then that could lead to bad consequences for that person or someone else for that matter.  I have witnessed accounts where someone has listened to bad music or read about something bad and then have been changed by it, but not in a good way. There has been incidents where that person did something illegal and then had to face the harsh consequences for that action. Then I have also seen accounts where people have been changed in a good way because of a book. I personally have been changed by the book '@ORGANIZATION1' in a good way. Now I realize how bad that was towards colored people, so I behave nicely to them since they are just as equal to everyone else. Therefore, carefully curating what children are exposed to, while still allowing access to challenging material with a valuable purpose, is essential for their development and understanding of the world.
1589	4566	2	3	REMOVING BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY BECAUSE THEY ARE OFFENSIVE IS A GOOD IDEA. I DO NOT AGREE BECAUSE, THE BOOKS SHOULD NOT BE GONE FOR GOOD. THERE SHOULD BE AGE LIMITS ON BOOKS. BOOKS THAT ARE OFFENSIVE SHOULD BE ONLY ALLOWED TO ADULTS OR A CERTAIN AGE GROUP, THIS WILL HELP WITH CHILDREN NOT BEING SCARED, TO HELP KEEP HISTORY AROUND AND, FREEDOM OF SPEECH. By making as age limit on certain books, we can keep children inacent and pure. With books such as '@DATE1', kids @NUM1 or under should not read that book. @NUM1 and under are still nieve. Little kids do not know about sex or even pre-marrital sex. With @PERSON1 and is girlfriend having sex every other chapter, its very inapporitte for a child to read. Also, with all the torture parts, it would scare a little boy/girl out of his/her mind. For instance, the book's graphic violence would be too much for a young reader to handle.  When getting rid of offensive books, we remove history. Think about where we would be if Anne Frank did not write her diary. We would not know how bad Hilter really was. We could only assume. With getting rid of books cause they are 'offensive' is a ridiculous reason. Books are only offensive to senative people. Books keep history alive! Think: 'What are we without history?' Losing access to diverse perspectives limits our understanding of the world.  Finally, freedom of speech is why they should say. Authors have the right to write what they want. If the reader does not like it and finds it offensive, then they should not read it. If Shake Speare, was told he could not write his stories, we would not have the tragety of Romeo and Juliet. So many books would be lost if someone could write because it was offensive. Censorship stifles creativity and limits the exchange of ideas.  Book that are too offensive or inaporite for a child to read there should be a age limit on it. If we get rid of certain books we get rid of certain history as well. Getting rid of those books tells a next coming author that freedom of speech does not matter to offenciveness. So keep the books around, its only words. By implementing age restrictions, we can protect children while preserving access to important historical and literary works, ensuring that freedom of expression remains intact.
1590	4567	2	3	Many people claim that certain books should be allowed on LIBRARY shelves. They claim that these books can be offensive to some and, therefore, should not be read. These books are known as 'CONTROVERSIAL Books.' Parents, librarians, and public officials have gone too far in thinking they should have the right to choose who reads certain books and who does not. In the novel To KILL a MOCKINGBIRD, the author uses many words and descriptions that people find are very offensive. These words, however, are essential to the setting of the novel. The author is not claiming that she personally feels that AFRICAN AMERICANS should be described in the way that they are, but a racist individual, such as BOB EWELL or many people during the time period, would not hesitate to describe them in such a way. The novel, To KILL a MOCKINGBIRD, is a great way for people to understand the history of the SOUTH. Without the descriptions in the novels, a piece of history would unknown to many. The novel, HOLDEN CAULFIELD in the CATCHER IN THE RYE, attempts to delve into the life of a pubescent, whiney, teenager. The author, SALINGER, uses many curses in the dialogue between characters. The charachters, however, are high school boys that live at a boarding school. To water down the language or to make the novel 'kid friendly' would make it impossible to describe the true nature of the characters. The novel also contains multiple references to sexual situations. These situations, although offensive to some, are necessary to show the progression of plot as well as the changing charachter traits of the protagonist, HOLDEN. Literature is not the only medium being targetted by those trying to completely censor libraries. Music, movies, magazines, and videogames are being targeted as well. In many cases, certain materials should not be viewed by young children or those who lack the maturity to handle them. It should be remembered that it is the PARENTS responsibility to censor materials for their children. Instances of violence, prejudice, and death are a diurnal occurence. LIBRARY patrons should not be shielded from these occurrences. In conclusion, many times it is necessary for an author to use words or descriptions that are offensive to many. Librarians should not be given control over which materials reach the shelves in libraries. Libraries should present a wide variety of books, movies, etc. to the public, fostering intellectual freedom and access to diverse perspectives. If libraries do this, it becomes the responsiblity of either the PARENTS or the individual to pick out books that are within personal boundaries.
1591	4568	2	3	Works of literature are works of literature no matter what they contain. All literature should be placed on the shelves of a library. If for some reason the material is offensive or deemed as crude then it should go into a restricted section where permission is required to enter. Literature is a strong item when it comes to persuasion. So we must take care of what we allow to be released or seen and to which eyes. Literature is written by the author for many reasons. Perhaps the reason is to make money or to share a point of view but either way the author generally wants his or her literature to be read. How would the author ever achieve his or her goal if we decided to remove their hard work from the library shelves. It simply could not be read if it is not available. This is one reason why certain books should not be altogether removed from the library. No matter how crude a topic may be it may still be needed by certain individuals. If there were images of a nude person in a scientific book that librarians did not want children to get their hands on then how would students study a topic such as sexual education or anatomy for a class? Of course there are people who simply want to see nudity for foolish pleasure and that is why permission should be required to obtain these books. A small closed off room in a library should be sufficient to contain all the books deemed crude. This way the only access to the books would be to get a key from a librarian. A book not read may as well never have been written. There is absolutely no point in destroying certain types of literature because some may feel offended. The simplest solution would be to simply make it so the only people to view these books would want or need to go view them. We simply can not lose certain pieces of writing because some parents do not trust their childs eye or because a person may be offended at the material. After all, when everybody has a chance to say what is offensive there will be no books left, effectively stifling free thought and expression.
1592	4569	2	3	Everyone has their own opinion about certain things in life. Maybe its politics; it could be a sports team. Everyone has a right to their own opinion. As for reading materials, the opinions could be endless and even painful to hear. Opinions of some books and media type materials are biased. People could often be offended by the materials that can be accessed through a public library. For instance, let's say a grandmother and her grandchild are at the public library. The grandchild picks up a self-help book and starts to read. Later the grandmother reads it and finds out it says everything opposite of what the grandchild was taught about life by herself and her parents. To the grandmother, that book is offensive.  Through observation, I have noticed when a person picks up 'an offensive book' and reads a little of it, they tend to put it right back where they found it. It obviously isn't hard to do. So why should a book be taken out of a library when all you have to do is set it down and leave it? The same goes for music, movies, and magazines. If you don't like the music, don't listen to it. If you don't think it would be a 'nice' movie, don't go out and see it. If the magazine seems raunchy, don't buy it.  Someone said it well, that if we took all the offensive books off the shelf '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' That statement is as true as any statement could be. What would be left? Everyone has an opinion and likely someone will always find it offensive. Therefore offensive books and media should be allowed to stay on the shelves.  Whether or not you find a book, movie, music, or magazine that is offensive, why fret over it? It's just easier to move on and forget it. Ignorance isn't all bad, and allowing diverse materials, even those considered offensive by some, is essential for intellectual freedom and personal choice.
1593	4570	2	3	Taking books off the shelves will not change anything; children are just going to **go** to a different place to find the book, **such as** a bookstore or other libraries if they like it. If I saw a book and I knew I wasn't supposed to read it, but then I knew it was good music, book, or magazine, I would get it because that's what children do—explore. Books are here to read and to look at; I feel if you know I'm not supposed to read it, make me show proof of age or don't give it to me. Really don't understand why some books be in stores and people don't want you reading them. Some children don't read at all, and to see them pick up a book, **sit** down to read, should be good enough. But there is always an age group that's not supposed to read some books. But at the same time, you can't keep the child away from the world and what it brings you. The books are put there for a reason and not just to be walked past.  I feel like the reason why children listen to music is that sometimes the track relates to them in a way that another person would not understand. So they feel the song other than what another person would hear—just the **beat**, **rythem**, **the words**, and **the artist**. That's not what some parents want you to hear.  Magazines tell a lot of things and show too much for the younger minds. I'm a father myself and wouldn't want my son at the age of **13** looking at any naked girl or ads about pron in **school** books or any of that kind. Parents can sometimes be over hard on a child and not let them do a lot of things, but they feel that they know what's best for you. Whatever they tell you is not wrong because the **parents** have been through it already. That would only lead to them doing things behind their backs. But if they want to learn the easy way, it's always the hard way. Restricting access might seem like a solution, but open communication and guidance are ultimately more effective in helping children navigate the world of media and literature responsibly.
1594	4571	2	3	When you go to library, you @MONTH1 have a lot choice about reading books, watching movies or listening music, and sometimes you might have offensive words or abusive langauge that is not appropriate for you children. Students must the right to remove the book from the library if he or she gets offended, or sometimes if there is a student who has came from a different @CAPS2 and they might get offeneded by the movies or music that are in the library. Books are most commonly used in the library. In those books, there are some book that are offensive to some student, and if one student find something offensive, he should have the right to remove the book from the library shelve. Many students like fiction books, which are true story but it might have some kind of offensive language or something that the student is feeling racist to him. School or any public library should remove books that contains inappropriate words that are not good for the kids to learn in their life. Music is also one of the important thing that is carried in any school library or any public library. Most common type of music that you can find in the library is @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3 music. Most of the times those kinds of music might not carry and bad words, racistism or any offensive language, but some of the songs might carry something that is not apporpriate for school use. Those kinds of music must be remove from any school library or any public library. Movies are also carried in some library, but not every library carries a movie. Some of the movies might have blood scenes, abusive language, which might not be apporpriate for some childrens who are at school. You should check the rating of the movie that you are checking out of the library or if you are watching it at home or any other places. Movies might carry some kind of rasictism in them. Library is a good source for reading books, listening to music, or watching a movie. While you are reading a book or watching a movie, you might find words which might not be apporpriate for yourself or for students who read those books. These movies, books or music can carry abusive language or something that is rasict to some people who came from a different @CAPS2. Student should have the right to remove something that is not apporpriate in school use, such as, books, music and movies, if they contain something that is not suppose to be in it, you should remove it. Therefore, careful consideration and potential removal of offensive content are vital to ensure libraries remain inclusive and safe spaces for all users.
1595	4572	2	3	Alot of people are offended by things that are uncensored. Some people think they should be censored, and others think it should not. It's all a matter of opinion. I don't think anything should be censored because it takes away from the freedom of speech. With censorship, one cannot fully express themselves or their opinion. That is why nothing should be censored, as open expression is vital to a free and informed society.
1596	4573	2	3	I strongly disagree with the idea of removing any materials from public shelves. Books, magazines, and the rest of the materials are based on the author's and musician's experiences and their observations. With the population of readers in the United States I know that the removal of books for what they might contain would have a bad impact on the people as a whole. The world needs its materials. The writer of the book writes on his observations and his own personal experiences in life. The author puts so much into it, why take it away because someone doesn't like how part of it's worded. Movies that are considered bad probably just have a bad word or a scene where there's a little blood. Lots of people like to make a big deal out of nothing. I seriously think some parents think if their kid hears a bad word or sees a little puddle of blood that the kid is going to end up in jail. Then there is music. The public thinks that kids should not be exposed to music like rap and hip-hop. I agree with that, but I also don't see if its Christian rap or its a clean song what's wrong with it. A musician is not just paid for his or her amazing skills with an instrument, but also with his or her way to connect with the listener. I truly don't see any reason for taking any form of materials off the shelves. The artist who produces it has a right to their own opinion. The public I feel makes a big deal out of nothing, and these small problems don't define the material the way the reader hears the work of the artist.
1597	4574	2	3	Where it gets, what, how and why, up noone wanted to read, it's to hard or I don't want to. The best way to get out of reading was reading a magazine. Sure, it's educational but it also can demoralize some people's thoughts and feelings. One way to get rid of this problem is censorship, or taking a specific book out of the hands of the public. We all have poked fun at people, whether it is to hurt them or just give them a hard time, it can hurt people. Same way with the media. Books, magazines, television, and the internet all are competing for the success and money of its viewers, and the best wat to do that is to appeal to the audience. Give them what they want. For some reason everyone wants to demoralize people, and that is where I think it gets to the point. Stand up for your rights and censor out those things that will lead to worse lives of those to come. Censorship may just be a big word to most people, but it carries a big problem. For me, it gets to the point whenever racism is a problem or else vulgarity is an obscene message. The music we listen to can get really intense. I'm a victim of the harsh music that we play more and more of today. Atleast the radio is trying to do better at this whenever they 'bleep' out the curse words or else persuade the artist to make clean lyrics that they play on air. That is where places are trying to clean things up. Make tomorrow be a better place than today. With all of these new TV (Music Television) shows and other reality sitcoms making air on television, it has opened the door to crudeness all over. They try to do a better job of cleaning it up in the sense of picture, censoring out body parts and on the worldwide coverage stations their mouths. Other stations like MTV don't do anything about the voices and the vulgarity people are showing and feeling towards each other. Books are another thing that could use some censorship. My teacher used to tell me, 'Son, if you can't read it out loud to me, then you shouldn't probably be reading it.' and I agree. With the technology and all the other things, children are more vulnerable to these harsh words and actions. Thus, leading towards a society who can't trust anyone and easily turns to vulgarity when need be. With the world today, it is quiet easy to listen to the uncensored version that is shed from the radio. One person tries to make tomorrow a better place but the next tries to demoralize it. It's one thing if your angry and upset and are standing up for your rights but it's not whenever you do it for the fun of it. That is where it gets, what, and how. In conclusion, censorship is a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides, but its responsible implementation is crucial for protecting vulnerable individuals and fostering a more positive society.
1598	4575	2	3	Censorship is a two sided question. There are people who believe that everything should be left the way that it is written. While other people believe that subjects that are offensive should be removed. Is a subject too graphic for students? People have the freedom of speech. Knowledge is power. These are some reasons that can be thought about before deciding if censorship is right or not. What is too offensive for a student to read? In history many things are considered offensive. If all the books that talk about history are gone then how will students be able to learn about the past. If students can't learn about the past than the past is bound to repeat itself. Other books like horror books are for entertainment purposes, so what is wrong with someone reading a book on a murder if its just for entertainment? There are books that must be kept so that students can learn to their full abilities.  If books are censored than that takes away a person's right to freedom of speech, restricting someone's creativity and sense of wonder. If certain books are taken off the shelves of a library then books that are famous now might never have been read. Books, even if they are offensive, can show someone's thoughts and ideas that could have changed the world.  People everywhere learn from books. Books about the past help people understand what to do different for the future. Many things are learned from books everyday and if certain books are taken down there will be things that will never be learned, because someone thought that the book was not appropriate for a student to read. Students read books about the past so that they learn, and the past is the best teacher. Having books that are said to be offensive can help in many ways.  All books should remain on the shelves. No matter what the book talks about, a student can learn from that book. If the book is something that a student doesn't want to learn about then they don't have to read it. A lot can be learned from books, and without books there cannot and will not be knowledge that is spread for future generations to come, so to censor any book would be a mistake for the future.
1599	4576	2	3	Libraries contain thousands and thousands of books and other materials. Within those books, magazines, and movies holds much knowledge, information in the non-fiction selection, and many entertaining stories and good morals in the fiction selection of books. If libraries began censoring their books, much information will be disclosed for no one in the public to read. The government could have multiple reasons as to why they feel certain books should be taken off the shelf. Some possible reasons could be they are racist, send the wrong message to children, or spread knowledge the government wants to keep away from the common man. Censoring books would be a horrible idea and affect everyone. Some books that could easily be considered to be taken off the shelf would be books that are racist, or suggest radical ideas. Everyone in the world is deemed equal and books which suggest one race is better than another could offend the readers and for which the government decides to have it taken off the shelf. Books that suggest radical ideas could also belong in the group of books being taken off the shelf. The government could be worried that the reader may carry out this radical/terrorist idea and would in return censor them. But censoring these ideas would be denying the public their chance to learn; there are racists everywhere and just because you simply toss the book away, won't suddenly rid the world of racists. Another cause why books or magazines may be removed from the shelves could be that they send the wrong message to children or contain vulgar content. Parents try the best they can to repel the content away from their children, and books they begin to read whether it be on their own or in school could introduce kids of all ages to new content their parents may not prefer them learning at their age. Parents may have a point, but children can not be protected from everything; they must learn and accept certain ideas as they grow and develop. Parents may be able to censor what their children read in their own home, but to take the books or movies entirely off the shelf would prevent the people, who enjoy or see comedy in these articles, movies, music, or books, to learn and acquire knowledge, even if their only purpose of reading is just for laughs. Censoring may also be introduced into libraries because the government does not want the public learning and developing ideas on what they think the right idea of doing something is that the government disagrees with. They may think if people start learning and developing opinions from books they've read, they may start to oppose the government, although people are always going to oppose the government, not everyone will like what is going on, and to have a growing society and economy, knowledgeable people are needed to invent and develop concepts. In terms of race and religion, everyone is considered equal, but in terms of level of INTELLIGENCE, everybody varies from one another. Which could be another reason to censor, so the public stays at the same level as their neighbors, so everyone is truly equal. Doing this would once again stop the modernization of the world, smart people would go unrecognized and the inventions that could have been stirring in their heads could turn to a blank thought, which is the same as everyone else's. In the book FAHRENHEIT 451, Censorship is the main idea in this book. They censor the books so that everyone is truly equal, and even censor so that people's looks and qualities all are equal to the others. This is not the way to go in MODERN society. The government would have full control, and knowledge would not be blossoming in the schools. Even just a little bit of censoring in libraries, whether it be books, magazines, music, or movies, would put a damper in the knowledge and brain power of the society around. Censoring books is an awful idea that should never be put into place. The government should never be allowed to decide what the public views. It is in everyone's own opinion and interest whether they themselves read or listen to the material provided, and to strip that choice away would be detrimental to the growth and understanding of society.
1600	4577	2	3	"There are many things out in the 'material' world that people take offense to. No matter what, there are always those people who have to be against whatever it is, whether it be a book or a song or a movie. But they do not have any idea what they are doing when they bring up their 'rights'. If they get to say that they are offended by the certain media product, not only do they announce that they have the right to try to have it banned, but they are giving the people who do not find offense in the material to dish out the same. If they can pull something off the shelves that they HAVE a right to, then everyone HAS a right to. Another thing is that they claim to find offense to the song or book or movie, but if it bothers them that bad, they should just not listen/read/watch what IT is that they are feeling offends them. It would be that simple, just switch radio stations, or pick up another book, or watch a different movie. Another thing that the 'offended' people can try is having an open mind. It would make everything far less dramatic. People that say that they have offense to whatever the material MAY be usually use the phrase ""IT'S offensive and i don't want my kid to stumble across it."" They say that they have a right to take whatever the 'offensive material' is off the shelf and keep it from the public. They couldn't be more right and stupid at the same time! If they have a right to take a certain thing off the shelf, then THE writer of the song/book/movie can claim that he HAS been offended by some song/book/movie that the first person likes. Then it's just a free-for-all for everyone one to start taking everything off the shelves, one by one. Everyone HAS the same rights, and if the first offended person uses them to bring THE writer down, then THE writer HAS the right to do the exact same thing. So the government shouldn't let things be taken off of shelves, because if they take one down, they might as WELL take everything else down with it. So, if some one finds offense to a song they hear on the radio, and they feel that strongly as to they want it removed from radios and anywhere that plays music, then they need help. When they find that song THAT offensive, then there is only one simple solution: turn the freaking radio to something else! Seriously, if someone finds the song offensive, then why are they going to sit there and listen to the entire song? Or if they find a book offensive. Would I sit and read an entire book if I don't like the content? Umm, no. If some one is that offended by whatever the material is, then they need to just do something else, because it's pretty rediculous to waste more time attempting to ban the song or the book that to just change the radio or find a different book. So if you're going to complain about the song or book being out there, just take your attention to something else, because every song, book, or movie out there HAS a right to be sold. On a light note, they could just have an open mind so that the song, or the book, or the movie can still be sold. They can try and read through the book to see if there is a reason that the author HAS written it this way. If they are conflicted by a movie, they should just watch it and test it to see if they really need to have it pulled off the shelf. Or if they are listening to the song, listen to it all the way through, or maybe even twice. The artist who sang the song might have been expressing themselves in a very deep way, and if someone pulls their song off the radio or where IT is played, then someone could be offending them in return. Having an open mind will let the so called 'offended person' see a whole other light being shown on why the 'offensive material' was even created. Then everything can stay ON the shelves! People have opinions, and that is one hundred percent okay. But sometimes people think that their opinions are the only opinions that matter. If some people get offended (or think they get offended) by something, they would try to removed whatever it was from the nations stores. But if they just sit back and think about it, then it would be okay. If they have a right to remove anything from the shelves, so does everyone. If that CERTAIN song really, really offends they, they should just change the radio station and forget about it. And if they have open minds as to why the things are still 'out there', then all the songs, and all the books, and all the movies will still be on the shelves for people to buy. I do not approve of removing"
1601	4578	2	3	"Controversy in the library. Someone walks into their public library; they are overwhelmed with books. Even though one person could never read that many books, the library has to have a wide selection, for the people that read different things. The library should not get rid of books that offend some people; the library is a public place that allows people to read what they want. If someone does not agree to what another person is reading, they don't have to be there. Since the library is a public place, people cannot just throw away a book because it is offensive. Just like Katherine Paterson said, ""And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" If everyone would throw away books that were offensive, there would be no books left. This would cause a lot of people to stop reading and learning. The public library is open for anybody to read a book. Keeping this in mind, the library has to have books that appeal to everyone. If they would only have one type of book, not many people would want to go to the library. The library has to offend some people to please others. People who go to the library go because it is their choice to go and get a book. If people find the books in the library offensive, they do not have to go. Books that people find offensive are on the shelf for others who want to read them. If someone finds a book offensive, they don't have to read it. Libraries should have as many books as they can, so they can appeal to every taste. They should not get rid of books that offend a small group of people. Those people do not have to read books that they find offensive. Libraries are a public place for anybody to read what they want, so maintaining a diverse collection is essential to serving the community."
1602	4579	2	3	Personally I believe that items that are found offensive should be left on the book shelves. People that find them offensive don't have to read them they can just ignore them and move on with their life. Students this @MONTH1 need to use that certain information in a classroom. If libraries take the information out of the library the students will not be able to find the info needed for their project or paper. Students will eventually learn all about these offensive magazines, movies, music, and books someday in their lifetime. If offensive books are taken down where else will they go, they are still going to be offensive somewhere else. Libraries who have offensive books are not trying to offend anyone in anyway, they are on the shelves for the education of the reader or viewer. If movies are that offensive, don't rent them and save yourself and the libraries time. People get offended by all of these readings from a certain library, if the library chooses not to take the books off the shelves then go to a different library. Also the internet will more than likely have all of the information that is just as offensive. Internet is a virtual library, you can search videos, books, magazines, and music. If people think they are getting rid of the offensive books, magazines, etc. They are wrong because the internet will hold that information for as long as it needs to. Library censorship is a pointless act due to the information provided on the internet. Libraries should be able to choose the books and information that they have in their building. As long as those books, music, magazines, movies, etc, are put in the right section. The movies that parents don't want their children to see this @MONTH1 be placed in the wrong section of the library. This can lead to problems and confusion. In that point of view you could see why parents are getting upset about inappropriate items on the shelves. The books should be divided so that children have their own section of the library and adults have their own section as well. Most of these offensive items are not placed in libraries because of this problem with people being offended. Movies that are that offensive should probably be in a movie store that states that the movies are offensive and could be inappropriate. Maybe people over react to the situation and don't realize that the movie, book, etc, are not offensive enough to make an argument over it. I personally have never been to a library and saw a book, magazine, movie, song that was offensive to me or my family. What does an offensive book look like? More than likely it has something to do with someone's religion, ethnicity, etc. Items are only offensive to certain people. If you or someone you know that is offended greatly by a book, song, magazine, or movie in a specific library don't go back or tell the person you know as well. In conclusion if a book, movie, etc, is that offensive in a library near by, avoid that library and don't worry about going back; instead, acknowledge that offensive material could also be learning material, and understand that the library's goal is to offer a wide range of resources, not to endorse any particular viewpoint.
1603	4580	2	3	Yes, I do think so because everyone has an opinion to say and it's something people like to look at or listen to. Now it would be different if it was a children's bookstore, like if they have music like Christian bible songs or Disney movies in the store, but not to have grown-up stuff. I really do not see the big deal if they are out because everyone likes reading something different. I think as long as you're reading, what's it matter what it is, or as long as you're learning something? I do not think you can get stuff out like movies and magazines because people like to read them too much or listen to music. So it should not really matter what or where they go if you ask me, because at the end of the day, it's all about personal preference and access to diverse materials.
1604	4581	2	3	I do believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are taken offensively. People should not be putting stuff out there if they are making others feel unhappy. Although we might think that putting stuff in papers and on movies doesn't hurt people, they do. Movies that have stuff to deal with sexual relationships, for example, gender marriage, sometimes suggest that people should not marry the same sex. They make fun of them because they are not like others, and they can take that very offensively. Very little people identify as homosexual. By us putting them in books, on movies, or making songs to make them feel offensive is not the best way to go. Another sensitive topic is special needs; movies or books that put down others that have special problems. Although they don't always show that they are sad, it doesn't mean that we didn't offend them in a way. Families that have a special needs child, sibling, or parent don't like it very much when someone puts something out there about their problems that they may have. Also, they will feel really upset and sometimes can get mad. Most importantly, books or movies making fun of people that don't have a lot of stuff is insensitive. It's not their fault that they don't have the money to buy things like others, such as a nice house or nice clothes. Most families have problems trying to pay rent and other bills if only one parent is working. A lot of parents that work are getting laid off and are not even getting paid for it. Worse, a family member may have to go to the hospital, and when you go to the hospital, you have to pay for the bills. Some families are in and out of the hospital year after year, and they don't have the money to pay for new things for the house or the people who live in it. In conclusion, I do believe that they should take certain books, movies, magazines, etc., off the shelves because they can be taken offensively. We don't know how rude it is to have something out there that makes fun of someone until it's too late. Many people really don't like it when they see something out there that's offensive to them; they don't know how to react, and they get frustrated, so censorship may be a necessary tool.
1605	4582	2	3	"Books are to be read not taken off because of what they say. That to me is stupid. Our children live in a world of war and fear everyday, what is a damn book gonna change? Nothing. They're gonna hear the f word and see blood and gore. Would you rather them see it for the first time in real life and not know what to do?  Music is one thing that can bring everybody together. So by our children not being able to hear some of the lyrics, then we are pushing them into being ""pussys."" Maybe there are just some real people telling the truth that you don't want your kid to hear.  Movies are something that people love to watch; come on, we pay money to get in to see them sometimes. Are kids are gonna be better because their parents didn't want them to see the new horror movie? They're gonna see it in real life one day, why not now?  Parents, you're not doing us a favor by not letting us see the real world; you're hurting us because when we get into that situation in real life, we aren't gonna know what to do, then we're screwed. Shielding children from difficult realities through censorship may leave them unprepared for the challenges they will inevitably face."
1606	4583	2	3	Nobody should believe that we have the choice to take books off the shelves of a library. America is a free country and we can write whatever we want. Everyone has freedom of speech; you're just taking that amendment and putting it into music, books, or a movie. When you are looking for a book and you find one that seems offensive, just put it back on the shelf and move on. Everyone has seen a lot of things that are offensive to races and beliefs. You hear jokes that are offensive, but that is all that it is: a joke, and it is not to be taken seriously. I read a book recently called '@CAPS1's your @CAPS2'; it was not what I thought it would be, so I just put it down and picked up a different book and kept on reading. If everybody were able to take books out of a library just because it was offensive, would we have any books at all? Movies have a protection against this called ratings. The ratings are from '@CAPS3 to @CAPS4.' If the movie you watch is more towards the @CAPS4 section, then it will have more offensive language and violent scenes. That is why there is always a blocked-off section at a DVD rental store. That section is only for mature people of the ages @NUM1 or older. If by any chance your kid strays in there and finds something not suited for him and you really get fired up, just think @CAPS1 let him wander into that section. @CAPS1 should be watching him at all times; @CAPS1 is responsible for him. I do not agree that reading material or anything in that matter should be taken off of a shelf. That's like saying if someone did not like how the @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 was worded, they could just take it down and throw it away. We would have nothing to read, diminishing our access to different perspectives and ideas. So, the next time you see something that is offensive, just put it back and move on, allowing others the freedom to make their own choices about what they read and believe.
1607	4584	2	3	"Censorship in libraries has gotten too strict, potentially making the next generation miss key life lessons. What if, as an adult, you could only check out children's books, magazines, and music? While that's extreme, what are we without knowledge? Where would we be without books, magazines, or music? No libraries mean no knowledge, no life lessons, no imagination, and no excitement. We would de-evolve; our brains are what made us advanced. As the quote goes, ""If knowledge is power, then books must be the means of getting that power."" Censorship impacts libraries, and here's why. Censorship often brings negative images to mind, like cuss words, nudity, and battle scenes. These are displayed in music, for example, rap music. While I'm biased against rap, people like music, and censoring it restricts freedom; if you don't like it, don't listen. Magazines are another issue. We've all seen magazines like Playboy. These shouldn't be in school libraries, but public libraries should have adult sections with hunting or hot rod magazines. Books also face censorship. Everyone has a favorite book. 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' is being removed because of a few cuss words. It's a great book, but a single cuss word makes people want to burn it, preventing future generations from reading it. People should relax and not fret over a few cuss words. So, where does free speech meet censorship? Apparently, in libraries where you can't read Huckleberry Finn, woodworking magazines, or listen to music with cuss words. Adults should have uncensored sections, teens should have censorship only on nudity, and children are fine as is. Consider how long you hide children from the real world. In reality, these things are deemed acceptable; otherwise, they wouldn't exist. If we remove classics like Mark Twain we lose not only knowledge and the story but our freedom as well."
1608	4585	2	3	Yes, some materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are offensive. Yet they shouldn't be removed from shelves. Reason number one is: What some people find offensive, others don't. Reason number two is: 'Offensive' material will always be out in the world. And finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their children from reading them and not the rest of the world. In the following essay, I will explain thoroughly my reasons for an opinion as such.  'One man's trash is another man's treasure.' That quote goes very well with the first reason: What some people find offensive, others don't. People's views about everything could be significantly different. For example, a book about someone killing the President could be offensive to someone with American descent, meanwhile, a book filled with cursing could be offensive to a religious person. As you can see, 'offensive' is defined differently by different people.  Offensive material will always be out in the world. Parents can't shelter their child from these things forever. At one point in their lives, children will learn offensive things and parents won't be able to do anything about that. Children have active minds that pick up on everything around them. If they learn from these offensive materials, then parents should teach them what is wrong and what is right.  Finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their children from reading them and not the rest of the world. That reason ties in perfectly with the first. Parents can't decide what the parents of other children should do. They can only do something about what their children are doing.  Therefore, my belief on censorship in libraries is nonexistent for the following reasons. 1.) What some people find offensive, others don't. 2.) Offensive material will always be out in the world. And 3.) If parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their own children from reading them and not the rest of the world. Thus, there should be no censorship in libraries, ensuring everyone has the freedom to access diverse perspectives and make their own informed decisions about what they choose to read and believe.
1609	4586	2	3	Should we censor the materials in libraries? Some people believe that some of the books, magazines, and music in libraries are too vulgar and obscene. This could be a major problem if people are allowed to say what is too obscene to be put in a library. Katherine Paterson makes a great point by saying that if everyone was allowed to take books, magazines, and music that they find inappropriate off the shelves, there would be nothing left for us. Books have been around for centuries. They are passed on, shared, and enjoyed by people all over the world. Books contain important information, stories, and tales of people's past times. Therefore, I do not believe that certain books should be banned from libraries. By taking away books in libraries, you are taking away the author's freedom of speech. Also, technology is rapidly advancing, and sometime in the future, I think libraries will become extinct. With all of the new devices we have today, people can just get their books online. Magazines are a great tool to advertise and talk about some major topics happening around the world. Magazines are a great thing to read when you want to catch up on news, sports, or just other miscellanious topics. With that said, magazines can also be bad for public libraries due to some of the explicit content. This is a reason on why some people would want to get rid of magazines from libraries, but I don't think they should be banned. By getting rid of magazines, you take away company's freedom of press, which is a major issue. Refering to the previous paragraph, technology is growing, and it is very easy to just go and look at news, sports, and other topics on the internet. That is why I do not think magazines should be taken out of libraries. My final discussion is music. Music has also been around for many centuries and it has done many things. Music is something everyone can relate to. No matter who you are, you probably have some favorite band, music artist, or genre of music that you prefer. By saying this, I do not think music should be taken out of libraries either. Taking away music is like taking away humans natural culture. We all enjoy it, but have different versions that we enjoy. Therefore, I do not think it would be wise to take away music from libraries. In conclusion, libraries are nothing without all the history, stories, news, and music that is inside of it. Censoring the libraries would not be a good idea and it would most likely upset many people. It is true that with technology that libraries may eventually become extinct. Until that happens, I hope they do not censor their materials, as doing so would be a disservice to the community and the very purpose of libraries.
1610	4587	2	3	Many have debated whether to stop distributing books, movies, music, magazines, etc., if they disturb and offend others, leading to anger and disrupting peace. Some believe community violence stems from disturbing books and music. However, people are often influenced by what they read or hear. I believe society should accept diverse tastes and learn to coexist. Punishing creators for content on library shelves or in music stores seems unjust. If readers and listeners find happiness in these works, so be it. Those who enjoy what others deem disturbing shouldn't be penalized simply because of others' disapproval. Why remove things that bother some when they aren't harming anyone? In my opinion, that's unfair. In my experience, complaints are unwarranted; these materials, despite their nature, ultimately strengthen us as a society, allowing for exposure to diverse viewpoints and the freedom to choose what we consume.
1611	4588	2	3	Most movies, magazines, music, and books are considered offensive to at least one person in this world. These materials often fall victim to censorship and are challenged daily to be banned, especially books. Mothers and fathers do have the right to prohibit such materials, but they do not have the right to ban them from all the world's children. Whatever the reasoning should be, censorship is wrong. It restricts the freedom of the writer, the freedom of the reader, and, as Katherine Paterson well put it, would result in 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Central to the freedom everyone has is the freedom of speech and the freedom of press. This does not exempt writers or artists who occasionally, or more than occasionally, include explicit content in their works. In every book there is a message the writer is trying to tell his or her audience. How they go about getting that message across is their own business, and they have all freedom to do so in anyway they may wish. People who wish not to see the writer's message have the right not to. But when they fear the message and try to stop anyone else from seeing or hearing it, then they are violating the freedom of the writer by telling them they cannot include the offensive material. Most writers include this material for a reason. For example, swear words, such as the ones argued in *Huckleberry Finn*, often times show the characters' traits and also improve the setting. During those times, people did call African Americans by explicit names, even those who were in no way prejudice. That was the way of life for them and the author was simply trying to show that to the reader. By censoring the word from text, people were, in a way, covering up the history of the African American people. Every person over the age of eighteen has the right to read anything they wish. They are no longer under the commands of their legal guardians and in no way are under the command of other children's parents. Parents who prefer their own children not to see or listen to certain materials have the right to censor the materials away from their children. On the other hand, they have no right to tell their neighbors what and what not their children can see. Every parent has different rules and guidelines for their children, and this is their right. They may believe that it is important for their children to be exposed to these certain materials early on in life so that they can learn right from wrong from the very start. It is possible that they even might not care. Whatever the cause may be, they have the right to expose their children to anything they see appropriate. For example, Judy Blume is an author who has been challenged throughout her entire career. Many of her books include the topic of menstration, which many parents found inappropriate for their grade school children to read. Therefore, those parents brought the books to the attention of the school board, who quickly removed the books from its library shelves. Many parents, librarians, and teachers were upset by this and argued that the topic was not at all harmful. In fourth grade girls are required to watch a video on the topic of puberty and in fifth grade many girls begin to go through these changes themselves. So how is it inappropriate for them to read fictional books that include the topic? Many parents believe it is not and even encouraged their children to read the books, but the other parents who found it offensive ruined these parents' children's right to read. Therefore, in the long-run, censorship is wrong. It restricts the freedom of the audience and of the writer, which prevents growing experiences for both. If everyone was to ban one book they found offensive, the world would be without any books and become quite dull. No one would be able to read and no one would be able to express themselves freely, and this is why we must oppose censorship in all its forms.
1612	4589	2	3	The library is a very sourceful place but there are just some things that should not be displayed or made veiwable to the public. Some topics or other things found in the library are not suitable for every one and should not be allowed in a public place. First, there should be a censorship on what you can and can not get or look up at a library. What if some one looks up or check out something that should not be seen by others and it ends up in the wrong hands of someone. That person then could end up using the information for the worst. Everything that's in the library is not appropriate for all ages. Like books with extreme violence or explicit content can negatively impact younger individuals. Next, there is a lot of offensive things you can find in the library. So things should be censored so one one ends up gettin hurt. The librarian or any one whos in there @MONTH1 never know what someone looked up or is planning until after it @MONTH1 happen or a problem is started. Therefore blocks should be put up for things that maybe be harmfull to others. For example, hateful ideologies could lead to discrimination. Finally, although people @MONTH1 feel it's no one eleses business what they research or check out, they should think, it is open to the public and anyone could easily see or go back to what they were looking at. Its not fair to be in a public place and get hurt by the offensiveness of some one. People have to think the library is open to children and elderly. The open nature of library resources means they're accessible to vulnerable groups. In conclusion, there should be a censorship on what you can find in the library. There is hurtful and inappropriate things that should absolutly not be allowed. Most important a library is a place that you should not get offended in by what some one looks up, checks out or even says, so ensuring a safe and respectful environment through careful curation is essential.
1613	4590	2	3	I believe that books deemed offensive shouldn't be removed. The book was written in a specific time, and its content reflects that era. If someone finds a book offensive, the simple solution is to choose not to read it. Furthermore, the author likely wrote with the intention of telling a story, and probably didn't anticipate that someone would be offended by it. Finally, the book might be captivating and well-written, offering value to many readers, despite being offensive to a single individual. Therefore, it seems unfair to remove a book from circulation based solely on one person's objection, as it could deprive others of a potentially enriching experience.
1614	4591	2	3	All library materials must be checked out before removal. The librarian ensures every item leaving the library is properly checked out by a student. We will discuss why materials must be checked out, consequences of not checking them out, and what happens if checked-out materials are lost.  The library's resources are for everyone to use. The librarian can inform a student if a book, music, movie, magazine, etc., is available or currently checked out. The student can then check out the material or request a hold for when it's returned, allowing the library to run efficiently as the librarian tracks all materials.  Failure to check out materials means their location is unknown. When materials are checked out, the librarian can trace them. Without checking out, tracking is impossible, preventing the librarian from assisting others. The material is inaccessible until its return.  Losing checked-out materials requires financial compensation. Loss prevents others from borrowing the item until it's either returned or replaced with a purchased new copy. The next person has to wait longer, because you lost the library's copy. The person who lost the material may lose borrowing privileges and may only be able to read materials within the library. If materials are lost after being taken without checking them out, the librarian cannot locate them.  These are some reasons why checking out library materials is important, ensuring the librarian can manage the collection, and everyone can access materials they need, reinforcing the importance of the borrowing process for the entire community.
1615	4592	2	3	If there was a book on a shelf that I found offensive, I would want it removed, but then again I wouldn't. Every one has there own opinions and there own view on things. Mine are different from every one elses'. I mean I find it offensive, but how is everyone else going to see if it is or not, if you take it off the shelf? Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. What we do, believe in, or think is what makes us ourselves. Just because one person finds a book, music, or some movies offensive, doesn't mean everyone else will. Others might happen to like it even if you don't.  Taking something away just because you think it is offensive, is like taking a little part of some one away. It's like the school making kids wear uniforms, it takes our individuality away. We all have to have some way to express ourselves and maybe the thing you find offensive, expresses some one else in some way.  There is going to be a lot of things in life that people don't like, but can you really just get rid of it all? It does not work like that. You are not always going to have your way in life, but it's life and there is nothing you can do about it. Just because you don't like something or you find something offensive, doesn't mean you can just remove it or replace it.  Life just goes as planned and there will be things that you don't like, but you can't change that. It is life and replacing or removing things won't make things easier. So if I found something offensive, I'd just ignore it and leave it there because is taking it off the shelve really going to help? In the end, letting things be, even if they offend, allows for diverse perspectives and individual expression to exist, and that's more valuable than eliminating what we personally dislike.
1616	4593	2	3	Yes I believe certain material should be removed from the shelves at a library if they are offensive! because people don't want or like to go to any public library that is open to anyone, let them come in and find some book or etc offensive to that person. Like a child grabbed some bad inappropriate book and his mommy found him reading it so she wasn't too happy and left. That could be offensive to anyone in particular. Their are certain books, magazines, etc that don't need to be in the library. Because the public doesn't need to find stuff like that in a public library. By the way someone that could think that certain book in offensive could report that certain book or etc if it is offensive to someone that is irregular at that certain public library. So watch what you bring or put in a public library it has to appropriate to where all the publics that walk in to any nice library. Being offensive, is not a good thing because you want to be able to walk in a nice public library and be relaxed not startled by any non-reasonable book or magazines or etc that should be there. Music is a big problem with people being offensive about it because there's so many inappropriate, bad language music around here that they have to watch what they put in the library especially for the little kids, seniors too. Books are material that should be fun or interesting to read for people, not for people to look at or find on the shelves an offensive book or magazine because that's not what the library is for, it's for going there relaxing and finding a book or etc to have and be good with, or checked out to use somewhere else; therefore, libraries should prioritize offering materials that are generally accepted as appropriate to ensure a welcoming environment for all.
1617	4594	2	3	Books, Music, Movies, and Magazines have been taken off the shelvs.we are forever more blocking or cesoring these items. reasons why iot is a good idea is because their are children parents and religeous people who are so agains some of the thngs that are brodcasted if you want something uncensored then you can buy or rent an unrated version. children are our future, why would you carrupt a mind so young and innocent? If your child is one second watching Paw Patrol and happy as can be and the next watching people being killd and the war bombs being droped that will forever be threre in his or hers mind. i dont think you would be to happy if your child was piucking up valgure language from the television or radio. Picture it your 5 year old talking to you and then says an innappropreate word not knowing where it came from you just ignor it then that vacabulary grows into words and sentances much worse turning thins child into a bit of a potty mouth maybe even violent. we dont want our future presidents and authorities to be so violent that they put the woukd in danger just because they got if off the radio do we? Parents have the right to watch what they want but also have the authority to put a stop to what they dont want them and their children to view or even hear.More families these days enjoy taking car rrides together and vacations watching television and listening tgo the radio as they go one minute they are all singing happy as can be unti a song with a bunch of innopproppreate words come on its not only dissrespectful but embarrasing to listen to your kids sing along to it. parents dont want to listen to that so they turn it off everything is fine until they hear them again singing to their music divices war, guns, bombs all around the car their is no escape thats when parents should have a say to what their children are not only watching but listening and reading also. Books about sex drugs and alcohol are not something an 8 year old should be reading we dont need them to be a bunch of stoners parents eaither. One minute you think you are reading a book about love and rommance next you read that the character is smoking a joint. People with strong religeouns dont want to be watching television late at night and then be watching on the internet gut that a preacher is doing drugs and sleeping with all these girls yes it may be funny to those non believers but to those who have a relligion it is just dissrespectful . Then listening to music hearing about people with no religion them lighting fires to crosses and using valgure language and the lords name in vein.not something they want to hear. When it comes to reading a book the religious have a strong oppinion on what should be read so they usually stick to the bible but whjat happens when their kids go to school to fiind a fake bible with nothing but lies and dirty pictures in it? Television shows, Music, Books, and magazines should always be censored it not only gives a good example for everyone but it helps us as a community to stay strong. Not being violent or cursing after everything you say is not going to hurt anyone. Why would you want a future president to be a violent killing machine? the environment we grow up in is how we turn out alcohol, drugs, and sex being read about or heard is not the way to be, therefore, censoring media is a necessary tool for a healthy and respectful society.
1618	4595	2	3	I believe that they should leave them on the shelves. I think people take stuff like that too seriously, if they don't like it I think they should just leave it alone. What some people might find offensive others will find interesting. There is a lot of stuff out there that might be a little offensive to some people, but if they don't like it all they have to do is put it up and go on with their life like it's no big deal. In the past there have been some movies that make fun of people for the way they act or just something they did in the past. Stuff like that I can understand because that can be personal. There have also been times when I have seen people make a big deal over nothing. Sometimes people say stuff and the person reading it can take it a whole different way. There are still a lot of people taking books off the shelf because someone complains about the language in it or maybe making fun of another race. I think the worst thing today is magazines because they are always judging people about who they are with, what they did, or even who has the best body and who has the worst body, which can be harmful. I think people should just stop worrying about everybody else so much and just worry about themselves, and we wouldn't have so many problems in society.
1619	4596	2	3	Different books are meant for different people. Yes, sometimes it matters when certain materials are not supposed to be showing in public. But, we need to know what's happening all over the world. Even as we speak, there might be a battle going on somewhere, or something very important is about to happen in another country. We will need this information all the time. There's this old saying that I read in a book once, 'You cannot judge a man until you climb under his skin and walk around in it'. It took me a while to understand what they meant by that. Then, I finally understood what they really meant. You can't judge someone by their outer looks; you must judge their inner personality. When you look at a book, movie, magazines, etc., you cannot judge it until you see it for yourself. Company people create these things for certain people that enjoy the things they love. TV shows, newspapers, books, etc., all the things to make them happy. We must enjoy what we have in this life. People always say that the world is going to end. But it won't, for this we will live on in the afterlife. So, let us appreciate diverse perspectives and find joy in the content created for us, understanding that life continues beyond our earthly existence.
1620	4597	2	3	BAD. Do you really want your kids to see bad images or read bad prompts? I didn't think so! You can help by teaching them what is right or wrong, good or bad. You need to help them have a clear conscience so when they come across these obstacles in life they will know what to do. You could do what my aunt does. Whenever she goes through the check out aisle at a local store she turns the magazines that she thinks is inappropriate around. My mom and dad say this is a silent protest, because she is hurting no one else she just simply doesn't like it. It makes my dad upset when ever he watches television with us and there is something that they never saw on television like half naked girls on the commercials so he will turn the channel or shut it off, because he doesn't want us exposed the bad things of the world. My mom is the same way but she won't let us watch certain movies; if I wanted to watch these I was usually at my friends house because my mom would probably be a little upset. I think books are ok because you don't see a lot of picture books you have to read them and imagine the image in their head. In conclusion I hope you would feel the same way I do so next time you go through that check out stop and say to your self do I want little eyes to see this. Then you should turn that magazine around, turn off the television and the music, you should also read the book so you know what it is about, thus protecting children's innocence.
1621	4598	2	3	To whom it may concern: As time goes on in this ever-expanding world of ours, it seems that one thing that is constantly being fought and argued is censorship. Censorship allows things in our world that are viewed as 'offensive' to be compromised. People these days though, must be getting offended much more easily these days, because it seems that media is censored more than it ever has been. I for one, am sick of having the 'veil over the eyes' as it were. Most censorship in this country is run through programs our government has established; censorship shouldn't be up to an organization, but instead to the person viewing it. In other words, why should other people decide what is most pleasant for us to watch? Nobody knows you better than yourself, so why shouldn't you decide? Why should censorship exist in our media if it doesn't exist in our everyday lives? There are plenty of things people see that they regret seeing; it's all in how you take it. No matter who it is, people are going to see things they don't want to see, that's just life. Censorship denies our rights as American citizens to have the right to free speech. If you don't like something you're seeing, then look away yourself, allowing others the freedom to view what they choose without limitations.
1622	4599	2	3	Should materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines be removed from the shelves if they are offensive? I don't think so, because it might not be offensive to everybody, it would be breaking the law, and it's not fair to the artist that created them. Just because it's offensive to one person doesn't mean it is offensive to everyone. For example, some people might think the *Quran* is offensive, while to others, it's their religion. It would just go to show that one man's garbage is another man's treasure. It would also be breaking the law, because it would not be giving the artist their freedom of speech, which is protected by the First Amendment. It would silence all the great artists out there, trying to be heard. They should be able to write, sing, or film whatever they want. It is their right to do so, and censorship infringes upon that fundamental freedom. That is the reason why they shouldn't be removed from the shelves: it wouldn't be fair to the artist that created them, it would be breaking the law, and what one person thinks isn't what everyone thinks, highlighting the subjective nature of offense.
1623	4600	2	3	Censorship is a method of limiting certain content that has been deemed inappropriate, widely used today in the modern world, most commonly with our movies, video games, and television. If other forms of entertainment like television and the internet utilize such methods, shouldn't our libraries? Also, if these methods are not made mandatory, should there be a block on certain titles that our children could get their hands on? This limiting agent called censorship can be very useful in our everyday lives.  Censorship could allow us to keep track of what our children and teens view, and this agent can currently be installed on such products as our televisions, computers, and phones. So, if these precautionary measures are being taken on the following products, wouldn't it be appropriate for the actions to also be in our libraries? Shouldn't our libraries be a place for children to wander through the shelves picking up and reading books at random without the thought of picking up an inappropriate book for their age group? Personally, that is what a library should be like to me.  Touching on the topic discussed before, a block should be mandatory for libraries. This block would not abolish the books completely but rather would limit their viewing audience. The books should be categorized by age group. And with the block, certain children, based on age, would not be able to enter the section and would prevent certain materials from reaching children that are not mature enough.  Certain materials should not be viewed by younger children. That is not only a statement based on opinion but also of fact. The factual experience comes into play when young children are reading and looking at pictures that were intended for more mature audiences, as these titles heavily influence a child's thoughts and actions. Just the other day a cousin of mine, no older than 8 years old, was watching two individuals of the opposite sex and began asking questions such as: when are they going to kiss? or why is he not touching her? These questions do not come naturally but only through her viewing of material that she was not ready to view. The origin of these questions will probably never be known, but there are ways to prevent such topics from being brought up, and that is censoring what children read, view, or listen to in our libraries, which ultimately helps to protect their innocence and guide their development.
1624	4601	2	3	There are many things done and said in this world today that people take offense to. It could be something someone said about one's religion, or taking away rights of others. Do you believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and articles should be taken off the shelves at stores just because people find it offensive? I don't believe it should work that way. There are a variety of different religions, races, and beliefs in this world, so if we took something off the shelf everytime someone found it offensive we would have nothing left to sell.  When it comes to younger children they are not going to know what to think and believe. When seeing and hearing things, children start to believe it. The media that adults find offensive should not be published and out in the open for children to see and listen to. Even though the kids may not take offense to any of the media, you still have to think about the parents and what they believe is right for their children. Many effects on life are put into the media everyday for everyone to see, and some parents may not find it suitable for their children to be hearing about it. Drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big effect on children and their lives today. I believe it is our responsibility to protect them from all harm until they are old enough to fight for themselves, and make their own judgements.  Our religion is a big part of your life because it determines what we believe in, and what we think is right or wrong. Your parents teach you the way they want you to act and teach you the difference between what they think is right and wrong. I was taught to always be respectful to others and try my hardest in whatever it is I may do. Some people may have an actor or actress as their role model, so whenever they see that certain person on T.V., you tend to think that whatever they do is okay for you to do. Some parents may take offense to a show on the television because they don't believe that is right for their kid to be watching, while others don't see a problem with it. So if we cancel that show on T.V., you are making one family happy and many others upset. When it comes to the movies, people have their own different ratings for movies, but the state rates them whenever they come out. Now at movie theaters you must be eighteen to see a R rated movie, or you must have a parent with you because you going by yourself and your parents not knowing get upset those of manys. With libraries and movie theaters they have what the state thinks is for adults only in their own little section. My parents believe that if there is a law for something it is there for a reason and we are going to obide them, as with some parents they have their own rules, such as some parents think it's okay for their children to drink under age as long as they stay home with them and they know what is going on.  A few years ago my little cousin was watching a movie with me that was rated PG-13. I didn't think anything of it and just turned they movie on and we watched it. It had a few words in it that his parents didn't agree to him watching, and he really liked the movie. His favorite quote from the movie was something his parents did not want him hearing at his age. He didn't know any better and since he thought it was so great, he was walking up to people saying that quote. His mother was not happy and asked where he had heard it from and he told her the movie, and she didn't think that he needed to be saying that and he got in trouble. I told her it was my fault, I let him watch the movie and didn't think anything of it because my parents let me watch it when I was his age.  It just comes to show that, there are many different things in this world today that not everyone is going to agree on. So if we took something off the shelf because someone took offense to it, we would have nothing left in this world today. We learn about the things we do in life because the state has requirements that have to be passed. What we learn outside of school is up to your parents based on what they believe. So if there is something out there you don't believe in stay away from it, and let those who do believe in it enjoy learning about it, as censorship based on offense is a slippery slope that ultimately stifles free expression and limits access to diverse perspectives.
1625	4602	2	3	How many of you out there absolutely love to read? Well, I'm going to be the first to confess that I do not prefer reading. Meanwhile, whether or not I prefer or differ readings of all types, I despise of any negative books. Censoring books is very important in today's lifestyle. One can make an inference by looking at the cover of a book. The cover often creates a vivid image and will usually promote a general idea. Let's look at some reasons why I feel that graphic or offensive books should be removed from book shelves.  What about the younger children who like to read? Although kids have a wild imagination, authors shouldn't fill their heads with too many crazy ideas. First of all, kids nowadays either grab a book from the shelf and show interest very quickly, or automatically assume it's not for them. Furthermore, when a kid comes across a very offensive book it could hurt their feelings. Books are supposed to provide educational information or be entertaining. They should not be dirty, nor discouraging towards certain people.  More importantly, how many different races are there here in @LOCATION1, or even all around the world? Many different races take interest in new books to learn new ways. When they come across books that are not teaching for all races or are acknowledging bad examples on their kind, they feel discouraged. Whether it's a movie, magazine, books, or even a song, never should it be offensive towards anyone. When authors, publishers, song writers, or movie producers release these items, they do not think of the surroundings. Their main concept is to entertain, but sometimes entertainment can be quite bashful.  Most importantly, if it contains sexual gestures it should be removed without debate. It's offensive to parents with young children who visit libraries. A public library which is open to all, should have sections for books, movies, CDs or magazines that are too vivid. There's a wide range of books laying around and one @MONTH1 come across one that is strongly offensive. I believe they should have a word in whether or not the book belongs on the shelf or not. I've not experienced it yet, but believe me it could happen anytime in our world today. If I was a parent I wouldn't encourage sexual magazines or books being shown at a public library.  Finally, during this debate older or more dirty minded people will counterargue this topic. Who says children should be allowed in the adult sections? Why are the discouraged people reading books that are setting bad examples? Those are some of the questions you will hear for those who counter what I've written today. Adults should be allowed their own personal section for adultlike books, movies, or magazines. Kids under age should stick to searching for books in areas or fields that will provide interest for them.  In conclusion, those who counterargue could be on the winning side, however I still believe offensive books should be removed from shelves. Book lovers all around the world want entertainment, but in good ways. The younger children of our time right now need to be influenced the proper way. Furthermore, there is no better way to help improve society than by removing offensive and noninfluential books from libraries, as it allows us to foster a better environment for learning and personal growth for all.
1626	4603	2	3	READING OUR BOOKS Our book and movies can be very scary and unessasary, to much violence and disterbence,for young kids scary books and movies will give them nightmares.Books like history books and @CAPS1 are good books for teenage kids, history teaches them the past and what it used to be like being a parent you need to make shore your kids watch the right shows and movies and they also need to watch the important movies to. Hitler treated people so bad he killed so many people I think its a good lesson for kids to watch movies about him and read the books.Also I think @CAPS1 is a good book because girl and guys should both no forceing something on someone is wrong, its not right at all. Young kids should never have to go through that she called for help but noone could here her. she was physically and mentally abused,noone would listin to her it was wrong .She never spoke up but you could see she was in pain just by the way she looked and her quietness.Movies like these should teach kids to never mistreat another person. Parents stay on your kids watch what they read and you should always be cautious about what your kids are doing give them book that are going to teach them something, in this way helping them to grow into responsible and empathetic individuals.
1627	4604	2	3	"What happened to everyone having the right to have freedom of knoledge? I do not believe that certain materials should be removed only for the reason that someone finds it 'offensive' or 'inappropriate'. Our youth have the right to access these materials. Kids should have that right because it allows more access to knoledge, it provides more realistic details about life, and keeps them from being shut out from the world around them. We cannot deprive children of that. First of all, all children and students at schools all over should have access to more knoledge. If certain materials are censored and taken away, they cannot access that type of learning. What if a student wants to learn more about how goverment and politics work by reading an an article. But then, the article is taken away because of one small comment in it. We cannot take away our aspiration to learn more about the world. Secondly, it can give a more realistic image of a person, place, thing, or event. Explicit content can give children more details about how things really are in life. If that is taken away, they might have a different understanding of how things really are and have different expectations of things. This might have an emotional or psycalogical impact on them once they see the real world. They should be well informed of what life is like in further detail to avoid confusion once they get to that point. Finally, they could be shut out from the world if everything is kept from them because of censorship. Being kept from that kind of knoledge can be an emotional strain. A friend of mine had parents that kept her from many things in the world around her, blinding her from what she should have known. As she got older, things became harder and harder for her. And now, she is affraid of many things out in the real world. This is all because her parents had used cencorship to keep her from knowing what was important. Our students should always have access to knoledge, details about life, and not kept from knowing enough to have an undertanding of things in our modern world. We cannot allow censorship to make such irrational descisions about what we do and do not have access to. And if it has such a negative impact on society and our youth, why isn't it censored? Our collective right to freedom of knowledge seems to be eroding, with increasing instances of materials being removed simply because someone deems them ""offensive"" or ""inappropriate,"" yet our youth deserve unrestricted access to information. This is crucial for several reasons: it broadens their knowledge base, offers realistic insights into life, and prevents them from being isolated from the world. To deprive children of this access is a disservice. Students should have the ability to explore diverse subjects, and censoring materials limits their educational opportunities. If, for example, an insightful article on government and politics is removed due to a minor controversial comment, a student's chance to learn is stifled. Furthermore, explicit content can offer a more accurate depiction of life's realities. Shielding children from these realities can lead to a skewed understanding and unrealistic expectations, potentially causing emotional or psychological distress when they encounter the world as it truly is. Finally, excessive censorship can shut children off from the world. This isolation can cause emotional strain. A friend of mine, sheltered by parents who censored much of what she could learn, faced increasing difficulties as she grew older and now struggles with fear of the world. This fear is a direct result of her parents' censorship. Therefore, our students must have access to knowledge and details about life, ensuring they are well-informed and prepared for the modern world. We must resist the irrational decisions made through censorship, particularly when it has such a negative impact on our youth."
1628	4605	2	3	"Hello I am Kristin, I am here to tell you why we should take some magazines out of our public libraries. Now I don't know if you have heard about @CAPS1 the magazine or @CAPS2 magazine, but I have and I also used to read them. In some of those issues are sex tips. Now if I was a mother and my child ran up to me begging me to let them check that thing out I would look at them and say no. They don't need to understand sex until they are in their teens or at least thirteen or fourteen. A child shouldn't be able to even go near that area; they should only be able to go near the children's section. Some parents think like me and agree with the fact that a child shouldn't learn about sex. But others are like why not, they are going to know about it in @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and when they are married also. There are also some other things that need out of a library. Some music might not be the best choice for a young child, like for example rap music. It has a lot of cussing in it and talking about sex. Some of the things said in a rap song are ""shorty let me ride you like a hurricane."" That's just like saying ""hey chick let's do it for the heck of it."" That's not what I want my kid to listen to. I want my child to listen to stuff that says ""hey let's go outside and camp"" or ""duck duck goose."" Some movies are okay to watch with your kids as long as it's not over @NUM1. But if it is, they can't watch it. I'll give you another example, my little niece is probably around the age of ten or so. She watches @CAPS5, @CAPS6, but only with her parents in the same room as her. She cannot watch it by herself or she will get grounded. This is why some of the stuff should be taken out of our public libraries; because children should be able to be children without being exposed to adult content."
1629	4606	2	3	I believe that some materials we have on the shelf belong to basically anybody in the world. I also think that the materials on that shelf are allowed to be removed as long as those materials get put back in that spot, no matter what. My experience with books isn't really that great, but I do like to read at times when I have the spare time. When I get a book, I observe it so that way when I take it out, I know I wanted to read that book and observe the great things about it. When I read the book, I'm not a very fast reader, but when I'm reading, I like to know how this book is going to end and how it begins. If I were to pick a magazine from the library, I wouldn't take it out because magazines are expensive to get at times and also hard to replace if it was ever needed. But if I were to get one, I would look at the important stuff, like what it is and how to get it. There are times when I think movies shouldn't be in the library because people could take ideas or steal them. Movies in libraries would be expensive to pay for if they were taken. If I were to watch a movie, I would enjoy it as much as possible because once that day comes to turn it in, there is no chance of watching it after. Music is a passion to most people. Most people would just go out and buy some CDs or something to listen to, and there is music I would listen to so that I get an idea of what to play if I ever wanted to become a musician. There are times when I would write down the lyrics to a song so that I can understand what the singer is singing about, or just listen to the song repeatedly. My point is, if something comes off the shelf, it should return to its rightful spot, or otherwise there will be consequences, and people will not be trusted much longer.
1630	4607	2	3	Censorship is generally not beneficial. Libraries shouldn't increase control over their offerings; individuals can choose what they consume. Public libraries are invaluable community assets, especially for children lacking resources at home. Libraries already consider children's access, with age-restricted sections. Parental guidance also plays a crucial role. Offensiveness is subjective, and diverse perspectives exist. Removing materials is wrong, as all information holds potential value and should be available. The vast knowledge within libraries must be preserved, not diminished due to individual preferences, allowing access to a broad range of perspectives and information for all.
1631	4608	2	3	Librarys are filled with hundreds of materials that many PEOPLE like and dislike. Books on HISTORY and SCIENCE, POLITICS. Those books are NOT there to offend you they're there to educate you on the subject. Censorship should be only for the youth as an adult you are open to everything. You make your own desicons and live by them. If you feel like a book, a song, a movie, is offensive, then stop reading, listening, or watching. NOT everyone gets offended. I believe that no citizen has the right to remove anything from a library because of the FACT- NOT every one is SIMILAR- PEOPLE have diffrent POLITICS and outlooks on FACT- SHAPING the WORLD. I conclude this by saying that censorship is enforced, but shouldnt be to a great extent, LET us do what we do, and learn what we learn. In school were forsed to learn what we learn, i believe SHAPING right to have out side knowledge, but only way that is that we get it from data bases such as computers, books, music, art, etc.
1632	4609	2	3	Libraries are places of learning. Books, magazines, movies, and all types of media are placed there for the same specific purpose: to learn and explore. When we visit libraries, we expect to find the information that we came there looking for. Whether the topic is something as simple as wanting to learn about a type of flower or researching the infamous 'In Cold Blood', we want the truth and information in its rawest form. Materials should never be denied from the library. It always has some kind of value. Whether it be for cultural, spiritual, entertainment, or whatever kind of purpose, books can serve as a purpose for information and exploration into a new world. Books that are viewed as 'censored', are only being viewed from one standpoint. Another person might find this book exactly what they are looking for. If someone sees a book as 'offensive' they must step into another person's shoes and see where they are coming from; where this type of information could be helpful to someone else. Touchy issues such as the Holocaust or books to do with religion could be considered censored, but that's only concerning one group of people. What about the other percentage? Now, don't get me wrong. I don't think that racy or graphic movies or magazines should be allowed into the library, but any type of material containing legitiment cultural, educational, entertaining, and others of the sort, purposes should ever be denied from the library. From working at a local library, I know that when people sign up to be a member of the library they sign an agreement that they know what kind of materials they can check out. So forth for agreeing with what they're allowing to let their children check out. If parents and guardians think that libraries are pushing censored content on their children, they should read the fine print! They are allowing their children to be exposed to this. And all 'this' is, is information and entertainment in the raw. Libraries are created to allow an open access to information for anyone. These materials should include information on any topic the library can get in their possession. None should be denied, ensuring that diverse perspectives are available. People rely on libraries as a source of knowledge, and we need to work to keep that source ever growing.
1633	4610	2	3	The problem is that some people feel certain materials shouldn't be in the library. I disagree with removing items from library shelves. Everyone has a different idea of what is 'offensive' for their families. One family might be okay with their child watching certain movies, listening to different kinds of music, and reading different genres of books. If you removed those materials, people wouldn't be able to express themselves the way they want to. Plus, the library would lose patronage because people would realize that particular libraries have restrictions on their materials, leading them to avoid those libraries if they anticipate being disappointed in finding what they seek. Ultimately, limiting access would negatively impact the library's role as a resource for diverse perspectives.
1634	4611	2	3	What if one day you took a trip to the library, and you came across a book that was offensive? Would you ask for it to be taken off the shelf or just ignore it? Every year tons of people visit libraries in search of a good book, threw act of observations and personal appeal. Everyone has a different choose in the types of books they'd like to read, with that comes offensive and non-offensive material. Being a teen i've had some experience visiting the library where things come across as offensive to me more easily than others but like many i choose to ignore it. Reasons for ignoring it are rather simple, everyone has different takes on things in which they've gathered since birth as well as personal life experiences. Because, everyone has different life experiences comes different views on what offends them or not. Personal experiences i've had in the library are from race seeing books that relate to the days of slavery can be offensive to me. But, a book on the black panther organization maybe offensive to someone else. So, does that mean it should be taken down off the shelf because it is offensive to both people? Books have diffent tones weither its on life, politics, or worldly issues that make different people feel different ways. I've observed plenty of times where someone feels uplifted from reading a book. Where someone else reads the same thing and feels terrible. Take a magazine for instance, one reader could look like that beautiful women in that magazine and feel great about themselves. While maybe an overweight reader could read the same magazine and feel like there not beautiful or self worthy as the women in the magazine. That overweight women could feel offended, while the other women feels amazing, because of that simple reason it shouldn't be taken off the shelves due to different views of what offends them and what doesn't. Everyone reads books due to there liking and what relates to them. If a book, magazine, or movie comes across as offensive then that reader probably won't pick it up to find out more about it. When i come across material in a library that is offensive to me i won't read it. Although i have picked up books that didn't come across as offensive, but after reading the material come to find out it was offensive. In response i simply returned the book and chose another one. If i walked into a library and saw a book that was offensive to me i wouldn't ask for it to be taken off the shelf i would simply ignore it. Everyone has different views on what offense them so there's not much you can do except just ignore it. If the case was that if a book were to offend someone and it was taken out of a library due to just that there would be no real need for a library. Instead of trying to censor content based on subjective offense, it's better to allow individuals to make their own choices about what they want to read and engage with.
1635	4612	2	3	In the book 'Fahrenheit 451', books are outlawed. In such a society, owning a book would result in recieving a punishment. Without books, modern people turned to electronics for entertainment. The society as a whole had lost modern human emotions and became submissive to the government. This led to injustices that the government inflicted upon its people because it didn't have any opposition. Katherine Paterson suggests that if books begin to be thrown out, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Modern people argue that certain media should be removed from libraries because they find it offensive. However, if every piece of media that was requested to be removed was taken out, modern important works would be thrown away. A recent debate has arisen over Mark Twain's 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.' This book is set in the South during the time of slavery. Huckleberry Finn befriends a black man, Jim, and shares modern experiences with him along the river. Mark Twain decided to write his book using the true diction of the people who lived in the South during this time period. He was the first author to do this. Because he wrote it in this way, the book contains the n-word multiple times. This word is not acceptable today, and therefore modern people take offense to his work. However, this book plays a major role in the American cannon. Mark Twain's work was written in a new and breakthrough method. If someone were to remove this work off of the shelves of libraries, he would remove one of the most important pieces of American literature. 'Kiss of the Spider Woman' by Manuel Puig is a book that explores the life of a convict in prison. During his time at prison, he discovers that he is a homosexual. He falls in love with a man named Valentin and begins to have sexual relationships with many of the men in his cell. These relationships are described in detail. If one were to read the surface of the book, he would find a crude description of a convict's experience in prison. However, that is not the case. Manuel Puig struggled with the concept of being bisexual throughout his life. He also had problems with his parents and brother. In 'Kiss of the Spider Woman', he wrote about his own feelings through his characters. This story is not about sex, but about feelings of entrapment and the relationships one has with other people. If this book were to be removed from libraries, modern people would miss a story that they might connect with. Katherine Paterson brings up an interesting question. What would happen if everyone could remove the books they dislike? The answer would be a society that is unable to share ideas, concerns, and experiences. Media helps to enlighten, persuade, and educate people about important issues. While some works may have offensive language, they also have a deeper meaning, so censoring them based on individual sensitivities would ultimately diminish the richness and diversity of human expression.
1636	4613	2	3	To the newspaper edits, should books, music, movies, magazines, and other reading materials be removed if the materials are viewed to be offensive? I do not think that is a good idea. Reasons why is that just like what an author said, if we remove books from shelves there will be 'no more books for any of us to read'. That is true because I am sure there are lots of books that might be offensive to people, but maybe the readers who get offended do not understand the materials that they read. For example, the topic of liking the same gender has become a problem; maybe the reader who gets offended about those types of topics just does not understand it or might not get it. Another reason why could be because we are in America, and the last time I checked, we have the free will to write and talk about what we want to talk or write about. It's fair to say that because we as people of the USA just have the 'right' to say what they want to say or what is on their mind. And just because the topic of the reading material offends them does not mean you can take away the writer's material. Doing that is like putting duct tape on the writer's mouth. If the reader has the right to say what is on your mind then what is the meaning of being free to write what you wish to write? If you can see where I am coming from, it takes a lot not to talk to a teacher or someone in a higher position from the reader, about something you do not understand and they tell you 'you cannot ask me that' or 'do not say a thing to me'; it is the same if you remove the book from the writer. Other reasons why to say no to removing the reading material could be because as humans we always are willing to learn something new, by reading. When a person reads they always learn something new. It could be a new event, a place unknown, grammar, the different styles of writing, or know more about the topic. Reading in books, music, movies, and magazines is a good way to learn new things it is fun and what is better then reading something fun? Cannot think of anything? Well it is because reading has a big role in our lives. Another reason why not to remove the reading materials is because it might make other readers feel like they are not alone, like a true story about a break up, of a family or a relationship. Or it could be a story based on something that happened to the writer like about a death of a loved one and how to deal with it. Just picture it two teenage girls, one is mad at herself and at the world and hates a tape about angels. While the other teenage girl just lost her grandmother and listening to the tape about angels makes her feel together or whole, knowing that her loved one is in a good place. Now think about it, the second girl would start to be like the first girl sad, alone, or left out. When you take away a material like a small tape from the library's shelf you take away a feeling with it not only from the writer but from the reader's too. Finally, the last reason why not to remove the materials from the shelves is because if you remove the material from the shelf it is likely that the topic is still there. It could be on the radio, on the internet, on the news and what can you do delete all of that? it is not reality. And if that could even happen which is unlikely that it would, people can still talk. And there is nothing that can stop people from talking. 'you can lock a bird in a cage but it still wants to fly away' or 'you can tell a cat or a dog not to run away but when you turn away it is gone' this are examples of what I am trying to say, you can try to remove books, music, magazines, but the topic you don't like is still out there. I understand that reading some materials might offend you but its better to just turn your head around and move on. The reader might not like the topic but others would and that's always good to think about. And maybe the problem is that the reader does not get the topic then maybe you should read it to learn from it, and to give it a chance you might end up liking it or understanding it better. Books, music, movies, magazines there is a reason why they are out there and it could teach you something new so why not learn it, as keeping these materials available allows for continued learning and understanding, even when faced with potentially offensive content.
1637	4614	2	3	Offensive articles, movies, and magazines should not be pulled from shelves; individuals have the right to choose what they consume. I think there should be an age limit for the material. Those who find the material offensive should simply choose not to engage with it. If these items are in a public library, they should be kept in a separate area for interested viewers, away from children and those who don't wish to see them.  Historic material, such as diaries and accounts, should be held at federal libraries to avoid potentially exposing children to inappropriate content. While some magazines, newspapers, and books are appropriately held at a public level, government-affiliated documents should reside in federal libraries, preserving historical context and important records. High-profile documents like the Constitution should be in high-security areas.  In conclusion, people who wish to view certain material should have the opportunity to do so, but it should be kept separate from general access, especially for children. An age limit is key to protecting younger audiences. The division of documents between public and federal libraries is also a vital consideration, ensuring historical and governmental items are secured at a federal level, while also maintaining public access to other materials.
1638	4615	2	3	Communities have many different types of people that live in them. Certain groups of people find some things offensive while others find them totally normal. Some of these things cause conflict. A library, for example, is one place you can find some of these conflicts. Most libraries are open to the public. Therefore, many different groups of people will be sharing the material in the library such as books, movies, magazines, and music. Having many different kinds of people sharing this material, the libraries must try to have material to please everyone. This is where the conflict begins. While trying to please everyone, some people can find some of the material offensive. Now for the big question: Should material some find offensive be removed from the shelves all together? The answer to this big question is no. Libraries must have many different kinds of materials in them to please everyone in the community. People are different and believe in different things. Just because one person finds some type of material offensive doesn't mean it is offensive to everyone. For example, things such as religion. Someone can find a book on a type of religion and find it very offensive, but others can strongly believe in that religion. Just because one person takes it offensively, doesn't mean those who don't should have it taken away from them. Libraries are for all kinds of people. Just because one person finds the material offensive, doesn't mean it should be taken away from everyone else. If libraries took any material that anyone found offensive in any way off the shelves, there would be no material left. People believe in different things. That is the way it always has been and more than likely, the way it will always be. Therefore, libraries should strive to maintain a diverse collection, allowing individuals to make their own choices about what they read and view, even if some find certain items objectionable.
1639	4616	2	3	I think the censorship in libraries IS quite abominable. I think there should be no censorship; it IS for the parents to decide what children can and cannot watch. I think if something IS found offensive, then don't watch it, it's as simple as that. If you don't want your children to watch anything offensive or rude, then don't let them. What I think IS offensive, IS when something IS removed off shelves. I think kids, though not young kids, perhaps 13 and up, should be able to watch and listen to what they want. I think certain things that people find offensive, are only offensive to those kind of people. It MAY not be offensive to someone else, so don't take that particular movie, or song out of libraries. A good example of this would be the book, To Kill A Mockingbird. It has been banned and then unbanned from many school libraries, because of its vulgar words and references to rape. I think that IS unfair because, whether we like it or not, children 13 and over will most definitely hear rude and offensive things anyways. I think books, or movies, or music, that have curse words, IS a part of life, because most adults curse. And taking those things away from a library IS taking it away from adults as well as kids. It IS for the parents to decide when their kids hear these things, if at any time. I also believe that using 'offensive' remarks, IS just another part of our history. Take To Kill A Mockingbird for instance, back in that time, it was common for black people to talk slang, and common for men to curse when mad. That IS just how people are and were. Taking those things off the shelves, will not protect adolescents from hearing them. I think they have rights to hear it if they want, and there parents have rights enough to let them. I think songs that have words bleeped out over the radio IS pointless because your teenager will know what they say anyway. I think having books banned IS a not wise thing to do, because it just makes kids want to hear the word more than usual. Basically we have rights to hear and read those things. Taking away the things we have rights to, IS taking away our freedom and free will. If parents don't want to have their children read or hear those things, then they need to supervise what they read or listen to. It doesn't make sense to single out a particular book, or song, that IS just like singling out all songs and books, and in the end, censorship undermines the very principles of freedom and individual choice that libraries should uphold.
1640	4617	2	3	Everyone has found something offensive throughout their life. However, many people find different things offensive than others. There are many different topics that people are offended by, whether it is race, religion, gender, etc. If there is a book that you find offensive in a public library, I do not think it should be removed. It is like removing something just because one person does not like it. That would not be fair to everyone else that goes to that library. It might be offensive to you, but to another person it might not be. There are many reasons that book could be in the library. It could help someone write a paper, to learn about a subject, or do some research on a topic. If all the books, music, magazines, movies, or any other item in a library was to be removed if one person found it offensive, then there would hardly be any books at all left in the library. I think all books should be kept in the library even if one person finds it offensive. It could be offensive to them but not to someone else, and if one person finds a book offensive and another person doesn't, then it is not fair to the one that isn't offended to not be able to check it out. If the concern is if children check it out what they might be learning from it, then that would be the parents' fault for not supervising what their children are checking out. The child might learn something new from the book. Even if it is offensive, you could still learn something from the book, movie, magazine, music, etc. If you still read the book, it could help you change your mind on the topic. It might help other people change their mind by bringing new opinions about the topic to their mind that they have never thought of. One condition on why a book, movie, magazine, music, etc., would be removed would be if everyone agreed on it. If everyone that came to that library was offended by it, then it might be in the library's best interest to get rid of that book. The main idea here is that all books that are in the library should stay in the library. The author wrote it for a reason, and it should be open to those who want to read it. If one person does not like it, then they should simply not check the item out; if that was what happened every time someone found something offensive in a library, there would be hardly anything to check out. Even if it is offensive to you, it could come in handy for another person, and therefore, its presence in the library is justified.
1641	4618	2	3	To @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, my name is @CAPS2 I am from @ORGANIZATION2. I do agree that books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves. If they are not something that the kids should learn about then why put them on the shelves. Many of the books that children, teens, and adults read is a cause of a lot of violance and threating. That's a major cause these days and we want a clam a peaceful world. Many of times we see teens to childern get into fights or have bad mouth to others. It's not a good thing to see and its mostly because they are either watching a @CAPS3 show about negtive things or reading a book or just trying to act cool. If we could put more important learning books, movies, and ect.. there would be less aggression in the world. Having a more positive day and going out and saying I read @ORGANIZATION1 wonderful book that taught me something new in life would be the best thing to hear. Teaching something that a kid could remember or is helpful in the long run is the greatest thing. Knowing that they are doing anything educational is just a great feeling. Now when do you see kids actually doing what they are supposed to. You really dont cause they are too busy wanting to find trouble to get into. That's really not good for them they should always learn about the good things to help them in life. It's a tough world out there for these kids and they should be taught the best way that they can. Therefore, limiting access to potentially harmful content and replacing it with educational material is crucial for their development and well-being.
1642	4619	2	3	Materials in public libraries, like books, music, and magazines, should be removed if they are offensive, because libraries should be places where people can expect enjoyment and helpful information. Finding something hurtful or harmful can be a disappointment. For example, content promoting racism can be deeply upsetting. No one should encounter offensive material when seeking resources. Consider also parents concerned about their children accessing inappropriate content like pornography. It is crucial for children to have access to resources that support their education positively. Libraries should offer satisfaction and enhance the community's reputation by providing helpful information, fun facts, and valuable resources; therefore, inappropriate books, music, and magazines should be removed to ensure a positive experience for all.
1643	4620	2	3	I believe censorship is a good thing; to an extent. I think that censorship deals with an age group and the permission of the parent(s) or guardian(s). If a consumer is the age of twelve and under; then the consumer should buy the censored books and etc., but, if you are thirteen and above you should be able to buy product uncensored. Some people do not like censored products because they feel it takes away from that particular thing. Music, for example, a lot of people get angry when the song lyrics on a CD are censored. It does not allow the people to get the full effect of the music and the 'message' that the artist or band is sending. With books; people get upset because they cannot get the full aspect of the book. Censoring a book is like taking away part of a masterpiece. Some books should be censored like a lot of romance novels; those get pretty graphic and go into a lot of detail with sexual themes and content. I do not think those books should be on the shelves. In magazines; it depends on the type of magazine the consumer is reading. If a person is reading a political magazine; those magazines do not put all of the true facts and details into them for certain reasons. If a person is reading a hunting or fishing magazine; then they can put in all the facts on the guns, calls, lures, and stories they want and do not have to censor them. Movies, on the other hand, are censored on certain channels. If you are watching a movie on a TV network like ABC or NBC; those channels censor movies. If you watch movies on HBO or Showtime they do not censor the movies because those are movie channels only. That is also why movies have ratings. R is for restricted to people under seventeen (without an adult present) , PG-13 is for people of the ages sixteen and under without an adult. and G and PG are fine for any age group. All in all; censorship depends on what age group the consumer is in really. If you are still in elementary school you probably should not be able to buy uncensored products; if you are thirteen to about fifteen, you should be able to buy the product with permission from an adult, and if you are sixteen and older you should be able to buy the products uncensored with out an adult present because you know you can handle the 'offensive' material, making age a key factor in determining access to censored versus uncensored content.
1644	4621	2	3	Books, music and movies are all important, specially to kids. If we decide to take one book off of the shelf, then so will everyone else and the book shelf will be almost empty. The same idea for movies, magazines, music, ect. Even though, some parents do not accept it for their young children to read or watch uncensored materials from the library, it is the parents' role to supervise their children and choose for them and teach them what is right and what is wrong to read or watch. Libraries usually require library cards. These library cards allow the person to have access to adults' materials depending on the kind of card the person has. Since it is the parents' decision to decide the materials their children have access to, they shouldn't blame anyone if their chilren have taken something they don't like off of the shelf. Libraries have done everything that needed to be done to have complete safety for the society. If we try to remove every single book, movie, song, or magazine that contain an offensive thing, we would have to remove almost everything. People have different cultures and beliefs. They might think some things are offensive while other take it as a normal thing. In the current society, a lot of people are more attratced to movies or music that contain some unappropriate materials because these materials have recently taken over in the media. We can't stop publishing them but we can censor them. There are different kinds of channels that view these materials. Internet, television, and libraries can all be under parents' supervision. Thus, parents can not blame anyone other than themselves, if their children read or saw unacceptable materials. Libraries should stay the way the are currently and keep their way of censorship without any change. Parents need to have full supervision to their children. Libraries have enough restrictions and rules on their books and movies based on the persons age; therefore, the current library system is adequate and does not require alterations, as the onus lies on parental guidance.
1645	4622	2	3	I think there should be censorship in libraries for those who don't like, or are not comfortable with what is on the shelf. Someone shouldn't have a problem with going or taking their children to the library. A public library is visited by children of all ages, sizes, and races. If I took my child or children to a public library I don't want to worry about whether or not my child reads or views something they shouldn't or don't like. Therefore, implementing some level of censorship could alleviate these concerns and ensure a more comfortable environment for everyone. This approach could lead to a more positive library experience for all patrons.
1646	4623	2	3	In my lifetime, I have been to many libraries. I have also seen many different categories of books, such as comedy, fiction, non-fiction, drama, and etc. As we all know, there are many topics out there that are not suitable for minors or suitable for many other ages. Movies in this time and age reveal too much for your eyes. For example, in cartoons, there is sexual content such as kissing. Some parents don't want their child exposed to that kind of activity yet. Movies sometimes put false beliefs in people's minds about the way things are, going to be, or the way you should see it. There are also some good movies placed in libraries, such as documentaries, history, biography, and etc. That gives you good insight into how things were and how things are now. Another topic is magazines. It's strange things going on in the world that **parents** should be aware of. I question why we put certain content in magazines, but children have easy access to them in libraries. Picture that some magazines have images that should be placed in some magazines. As there are bad things, there are also good things that come from magazines. Magazines are, in some ways, just as useful as books. They carry very helpful information. Music is also a big topic that's placed in libraries. Some of the language that is placed on CD tracks are good, BUT there's a lot of bad material that's on them also. So many people out there, known as **artists**, say some very harsh and profane words that many adults and children should just not want to hear. Like I said before, as there is bad, there is much good. We have gospel, jazz, **blues & classical**, and etc. that many people enjoy listening to. In conclusion, there are many good things that belong in libraries, but also many bad. Libraries, in my opinion, should take more caution on what people have access to. Very easily, a young child (that can read) can pick up an adult book, go sit in a corner, read, and be exposed to most things parents are exposed to. So, in my opinion, yes, certain things should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive, ensuring a more appropriate and carefully curated selection.
1647	4624	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a very controversial topic that has conflicting views. One side, in favor of censorship, believes that some literary material contained within a library could be offensive to some, and that it should be removed or censored. The other side, in favor of free speech, believes that all literary material in a library should be kept, whether it is seen as offensive or not. Of these two sides of such a controversial issue, it is evident that censorship should not be instilled within libraries, because of the right to free speech, the true meanings and expressions must be upheld, and it would take the oppurtunity to read such a work truly from an interested reader. The first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because of the right to free speech. This right belongs to all citizens of the United States, and shouldn't be taken away because one person may think something is offensive. I have observed that many people will often attempt to steal this right from people, and this instillation of censorship will do just that to the authors. It is important to protect the voices and perspectives of writers, even when those voices challenge or discomfort us. This is the first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor. The next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because this censorship would dull down the true meanings and expressive themes that literary works are meant to express. An example of a story that would suffer from censorship is the famous 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.' Such a novel, though containing offensive language at times, would not read the same if such language was omitted and removed. Instead, Mark Twain's expressions within the story would be dulled down immensely and be nearly silenced. To sanitize literature is to diminish its power and impact, ultimately distorting the author's message. This is the next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor. The last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because it removes the availability of the book from an interested reader. Many times I have seen people blatantly have a tantrum over an offensive literary work. I have been offended by things that I have read before, and instead of demanding its removal and crying for a less offensive substitute, I simply either stopped reading the work or read through it anyways. A person must know that the use of offensive language within literary works rarely is intended to attack the reader, but rather to strongly get a point across. If a person finds the material too offensive to read, then they should simply stop and find a more suitable work. By remaining calm and passive about these things, it keeps the literary work on the shelves in its true form for other people who wish to read it. This is the last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor. It is clearly evident that the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is a bad idea as a whole. The decision to censor literary works would be bad because it would strip the author's right to free speech, it would dull down the author's true meanings and expressions, and it would remove the oppurtunity to read such a work from an interested person. The removal or censorship of literary works would be a terrible decision that all would regret in the years to come, as it undermines intellectual freedom and limits access to diverse perspectives. This is why the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is an unjust endeavor.
1648	4625	2	3	Dear @PERSON1 news paper editor. Pulling a book, cd, dvd/vcr tape, magazine, etc., because of whether or not they are offensive or obscene is a pansy move from the people who think the world must be perfect when in reality it is so far from perfect that it is disgusting, and yet the sad truth is the fact that only a small percentage of people on the face of the earth have come to accept this truth. If I have not convinced you otherwise please keep reading about my perspective.  I believe that if the world can not handle what is on the shelf at the public library they should just leave it alone, and stay in there comfort zone of reading selections. If they are offended they can go to read some where else; the library is a public space.  I understand that people might have been there first. If that is the case well then nicely ask the person/persons offending you to move some where else, if it is truly bothering you.  The world is not a perfect place by no means. The world does have it's positives for instance the @CAPS1 United Nations, and north atlantic treaty organization (@CAPS2 N.A.T.O.), but for some reason the world acts as if they are going to die if there is not perfection all around them. That means that they decided to strip the libraries all over the world of the offensive and obscenities in all the books so that way boredom and perfection could slowly but surely set into the worlds minds to be okay. Well I refuse to let it set into my mind, and I hope you choose the same for yourself, and advocate for diverse reading materials.  Your's @CAPS3 Sincerely,  @CAPS4 A Concerned Citizen
1649	4626	2	3	Reading is something people choose to do for their own entertainment, for their enjoyment, to gain personal knowledge and many other reasons. Reading should not be restricted by any means. If a person has an interest in a book, they should be able to read it if they so choose. I believe that censorship within a library is not something that should be done. For a person to be able to take away another persons right to read a book of his or her choice, is mind boggling. I know that some books can be pretty desciptive and graphic but these boundaries sould be set within a home. If a parent doesn't want their child reading a book don't take in out on the entire community. It's not fair to everyone else. If you personally don't find entertainment or enjoyment out of a book that you consider offensive, there are many other alternative books to read. Nobody is forcing you to be miserable and read a book you don't like, that is why there are many sections in a library. The sections in a library range from mystery to romance, so find a different book and leave the offensive ones to people who like to read them. That way you are happy and so is everyone else. Libraries are places people visit to check out and read books. Usually a person chooses a book because of the cover or a friend has requested you to read it. If libraries start to remove books from the shelves then there won't be any left for the rest of us to read. Not only will there be no more books but there also won't be anymore libraries for people to go to. This would limit access to diverse perspectives and knowledge. Just because a few people think that there are some offensive words, scenes and or other ideas in a book doesn't mean that it is right to take away the privilidge of another person to read it. If you have a problem with it, don't read it. It's that simple. Don't make other book readers suffer because of one persons opinion, as the freedom to read should be protected for everyone.
1650	4627	2	3	I do believe that certain books, music, movies, and other media should be removed from the shelves of libraries, if they are found to be offensive. We do not need anymore reasons for people to judge someone based on something that they read. If the media is offensive, than someone's feelings will get hurt. I remember a time when I read a book, and it had some really offensive things about homeless people. I felt bad just for reading this, because it just made them sound like horrible people. Which in a lot of cases isn't true, but I remember people that read it and they believed of every word of it. Those people now rudely look down on them. So why would we allow this book to be in the library? This book changes the way many people think, and so do many more books. There is a lot of offensive music too. Today most of the songs people listen to are, but we just don't realize it. These should not be available in a library, cause anybody could rent them. Which isn't good, cause they could really hurt someone's feelings by just singing a song they think is okay. Another thing libraries need to watch are magazines. Most magazines are okay, but some like to throw in little inapproiate stories. So to really protect everyone and anyone they need to really go through the magizine and make sure its not offensive at all. The media I think libraries really need to sit down and think over if they are okay, or not are definately movies. They need to realize that kids could rent these, and think are they apporiate. I think libraries should only have family oriented movies. This way nobody is harmed by anything they will veiw. This will help ensure that the content being consumed is generally safe and uplifting for everyone. In conclusion, libraries should be extra careful in their media choices. They need to try and limit everything that is offensive, to try stop anybody from getting harmed. By carefully curating their collections, libraries can promote a more respectful and inclusive environment for the entire community.
1651	4628	2	3	Should there be censorship in libraries? Many people will answer this question differently. I feel there should be absolutely no censorship in libraries. Allowing censorship in libraries is an intrusion of our rights. It contradicts freedom of the press, thus denying authors the opportunity to share their perspectives. If someone wants their opinion to be read they should have that right. I also feel censorship in libraries goes against freedom of speech. What is writing, but written speech? If someone wants to say something, they should be able to say it freely. If a mute person wants to get a point out, they should be able to do so by writing, and that writing should be accessible. What some people consider offensive, others do not. If someone finds it offensive, they should simply not read it; imposing one's views on others limits intellectual exploration for everyone.
1652	4629	2	3	'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. This quote says it all, if everybody had their say in what is offensive or not then everything would be offensive. Books are often written for the enjoyment of the reader, and if not that books are for informational purposes. Not everybody will have the same views of one book as someone else does, so it would be unfair to not be able to read it because someone else doesn't want you too. Personally I like to read books that interest me, as I can assume most do everyone else. Generally to keep my attention, I like to read books with a lot of action and an intense plot. I realize that some people would find this offensive and not acceptable for children, but I consider myself a good kid now and I am not negatively affected by those books I read. When I was a kid in 5th grade, I read a book far beyond what most 5th graders read. This book contained many vulgar words and even a racial slur, but I was mature enough to handle them. Just the other year, the librarian, whom I stay in constant contact with, asked me if she should take the book off the shelf. I told her no, with my reason being that I found it to be a very interesting book! I would have been upset to see a great book no longer be accessable because of some vulgar language, because what it comes down to are just words that express heavy emotion. Many books such as, the dictionary or encyclopedia's are used for informational purposes. These books can also be accessed by children. I myself as a kid have looked through the dictionary looking for 'bad words'. Does that make it jusitifiable to remove? Even the books we read in school today have 'bad words' in them. When I was a freshman in high school, my English teacher talked about how the school board tried to get rid of 'To Kill A Mockingbird', because it had racial slurs and much racism involved. She was very against getting rid of the book because she found the novel to be a very interesting read for her and her students. Books just can't be taken out of the hands of high schoolers because some uptight adults think it is offensive, when in all reality they teach great morals and lessons for the youth. If you take a look at politics you can see that not everybody has the same opinion and some can be very vocal about their's. The same idea can go with any topic in the world today. Somebody thinks one way and someone else thinks the complete opposite. This is the issue with taking books off the shelves. One person thinks it is a very offensive book and the other thinks it is a very beneficial book. My personal opinion is that a book is a book and people are going to interperte them differently. So if one book can get taken off the shelves then this will just start a chain reaction until every book is gone. There is no point! If someone shouldn't read that book then they shouldn't be allowed. The answer is as simple as that. When it comes down to it people are just going to have to get over not having their way, because they want a book removed from the shelf. Most people are offended by something and usually not everybody is offended by the same thing, which makes this issue impossible to deal with. There is only one answer to this question of: Should the library be censored? The answer is no, just let it be. The book was published so there must have been a good reason behind it. In the end of it all a book is just a book, a vessel for stories and ideas, and we should allow them to exist freely.
1653	4630	2	3	Have you ever walked into a library and saw a book that you wouldn't what your child or any young one to pick up and read? There is several book in the library that young children should read. I don't believe that you a certian book should be removed from the library because it is offensive to some or not suitable for children, but there is a few things that can be done to keep those books away from your kids or any child. The possable things that could be done is; move those book to a higher shelf, designate a certian area for those books, or put an age limit on those books. The first way that you could keep an offensive book out of your childs, or any other childs hands is to move those book to a higher shelf. Doing this will keep those books out of your childs sight and reach, and keeping them out of children's hands will prevent them from reading them. The next possability to keep offensive books out of your childs or any childs hand is to, designate a certain area for those books in the library. Doing this will provied a 'barrior', so that you could tell your child to stay out of that area, and keep a watch on them to make sure they don't go in that area, while also knowing where those books are located. The final possability to keep offensive books out of your childs or any other childs hands is to put an age limit on those book to keep the children from being able to check-out those books, to read them. This would make the childen have be a certain age before the can check them out, preventing them from reading them without parental consent or until they are deemed mature enough. These are a few possabilities that could be used to keep offisive books out of childrens hands, and preventing them from reading those offensive books that you wouldn't want them getting a hold of and reading, offering different approaches to managing access without resorting to outright censorship.
1654	4631	2	3	Many people have different views on censorship. Some people believe there are movies, books, newspapers, etc. that contain subject matter that is not appropriate for some viewers and that they should keep their writing on certain things to a certain extent or not at all. Other people believe people have the right to say what they want when they want, on a topic they believe to be true or not true, or very important to them, also called freedom of speech. Also, people believe that yes, there are some things written out there that should not have been written but they have no control over it, and to some people, it may be appropriate. I do believe there are stories written that are not appropriate. But I know that even though I find the subject to not be appropriate or of any use to me, another person will. I know that every person out there is different and has their own beliefs on different things. If people had the power to control what books, magazines, newspapers, and movies were in libraries then someone was right, 'We would have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. Certain books, newspapers, movies, and magazines could help certain people and be of interest to certain people no matter what the subject is or how inappropriate it may be as long as they are of the right age. If the story is plainly about drugs, sex, alcohol, and violence with really no use to it, then yes I do believe it should be taken off the shelf. You do not know who could get their hands on that movie, book, or article. It could be a little kid and we do not want to open the door for that. People have many different beliefs and I do believe we should not take anything off the shelf that could be of use to anyone, but I also do believe there is a certain extent, and finding the balance is necessary to both protect the vulnerable and respect intellectual freedom.
1655	4632	2	3	What happened to using books and films as simple entertainment? Why are we now cautious of what our children pick off the shelf? Society today has changed the way we once viewed our sources of entertainment. Books are now viewed with skepticism and once harmless movies and magazines are full of material no one should be reading or watching. Music used to be a beautiful form of art, but now when you turn on your radio, what do you hear? Mindless spewing of words linked together with curses and other garbage. Should libraries use caution when renting something to someone who shouldn't be using that material for harmless entertainment. There once was a young girl, fourteen or fifteen, who loved to read and listen to music. She was bright but shy, and used books as her friends. Each day she walked to the library for a new story to dive in. One day she came across a book on the top shelf of the fiction section. The book looked used, for its spine was badly split and several of the pages were nearly detached. She reached for the book, intrigued, and flipped through the pages. Her innocent and naive mind caught a hold of a world she didn't know. After reading the book, she was filled with guilt. It wasn't a good book, but a book that was laced with a harmful message. This young girl, once pure and simple, now knew things no one at that age should know. So, why wasn't there a warning of some sort? The difference between writing something offensive and being offensive is that the writer usually doesn't intend to be hurtful or rude. The author most likely intended for the peice of literature to be enjoyed with a clear and playful attitude. However the comparison between writing something offensive and being offensive is far different. When you read something in a book or magazine that disturbs you, put it down, or throw it away. No one is forcing you to read the material. Yet, the real question is; what about our children? How do we keep them safe from offensive literature? And what about music? Or movies? Remember the old black and white films? How, no matter what the plot or storyline is, the two leading roles somehow fall in love in the end? The ending title fills the screen just before the two actors share a kiss and then the screen goes black. Mind, there are still movies with happy endings and a positive message. What about the other films? Some of the biggest blockbusters are those which have either violence, some form or racism, and/or sexual content. Personally going to the movies to see a new action movie that looks thrilling and entertaining should be fun, but where does the fun stop? After the guy in the first scene has just been brutally murdered? Or after the two lovers share a special bond that should be kept private? And what happens when this movie is released and checked out from the library by a young boy who just wants a fun sleepover with his friends? How do we keep these sorts of material away from them? Libraries should use major caution when printing labels to place on their books, movies, magazines, etc. Librarians should make sure that the book a child hands to them is safe to read for that age level. Also, they should check the ratings on movies or make them not available to certain age group. Parents should also use caution when letting your child go to the movies with friends. Make sure they see something fun, but with a positive message. Should libraries take certain material off their shelves? I don't think so. However, be careful what you read or watch, for it might not please you. Use the internet as a source to find reviews on books and magazines, so see how well it was rated and then decide whether it is an intriguing read or an amazing film. Have fun, but be careful, and actively engage in understanding the content's potential impact before consumption.
1656	4633	2	3	Books, magazines, and music should be removed if they contain offensive content for individuals or children. These materials can significantly influence a child's or an adult's imagination, potentially leading them to perceive harmful actions as acceptable. Anything considered inappropriate should be kept out of reach, ensuring children and adults aren't exposed to them. This exposure can negatively impact their development and decision-making. Books and music that lack positive value should also be removed. Books and magazines with pornographic or otherwise harmful content should be taken off shelves. Children and adults possess vivid imaginations, which, if fueled by negative influences, can lead to harm towards themselves or others. Books, magazines, and music should inspire, not distract and cause harm. Unknowingly, individuals can hurt loved ones through exposure to inappropriate content. Such influences can have devastating effects. The availability of potentially harmful books, magazines, and music only creates problems and should be removed from the market. The enticing images and narratives can mislead people, creating false expectations. Furthermore, they can foster the misguided belief that success can be achieved through superficial means. These are negative influences that can impact anybody. Books, magazines, and music that negatively affect the brain and offer no benefit should be removed. Materials that are not used for good are useless. Trashy books and music can sometimes lead to suicide or irrational behavior, causing regret. Therefore, these materials are not useful for a person or child. In conclusion, books, magazines, and music that are not beneficial should be removed from shelves, replaced with resources that nurture the mind. Materials that are not resourceful for a person's mind should be put away, as they can lead to instability and poor choices, ultimately leading to failure. In summary, unresourceful books, magazines, and music should be removed to prevent harm.
1657	4634	2	3	I do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found offensive. First, you have to consider what is offensive to most people, and who should be the people to determine if it should be sensored or not. People should be able to decide for themselves if they can or cannot get an item off of a shelf, because they might not even consider it offensive. If you are a parent, you have the right to not let your children watch or read certain materials, but you can't get it taken off the shelf because then it prohibits other people from being able to get that same material that they think is acceptable. Things that are offensive range from cussing all the way to extreme violence. Some people might not mind that there are a couple of bad words or a little violence, but others will find it very offensive. In my personal experience, I tend not to think that a little cussing is offensive, but I do know some people who balk even hearing one minor cuss word. Many movies nowadays are made up of content that is mildly offensive, but only if you take it seriously. The movies make fun of things that people might find offensive, which probably offends those people even more, but they do not have to watch it if they don't want that movie! It just depends on the person and what they have grown up around, or what they think is right or wrong.  It is either your own responsiblity or a parents responsibility to determine whether the content of a book or movie is appropriate. Many times parents use the argument that children are too young to make the judgement on a book or movie, and that is very true. So most children movies and books are appropriate, and do not include content that children are not quite ready to handle. If you are older, then you can probably make the decision to read or watch something because it is more appropriate for your age. Many times you have already been exposed to the ideas prevalent in books in movies because those things are already in your life. It comes down to who the movie is for and what content you think is appropriate for their age.  The idea about taking these books off the shelves would be disastarous. The reading lists in schools would have to be cut down because parents didn't approve, and the children would lose valuable knowledge that is in most literature. One person could want to rent out their favorite horror movie and suddenly it would not be there because a couple of people thought it was offensive. There would be nothing left in libraries if one person did not approve of something because then every item would have at least one person disapprove.I once read To Kill a Mockingbird, and our teacher told us that in another state this book had been banned because a couple of parents didn't like one or two things from the book. This book has many valuable ideas and lessons, and is considered a great piece of literature. These parents wanted the book to be banned from all schools, and all libraries all over the country, and that would be infringing on other people's rights of freedom of speech. The parents can say what they want about the book and not let their own child read it, but they cannot stop that opportunity for everyone else who wants to read the book. Taking it off the shelves would be taking off those ideas as well. Literature and every other movie and type of literature is what shapes a culture. There have been so many movements over time, many started with literature and it affected the culture and the people. Censorship would just take away a part of our culture, which would be devestating.  You should look at your own life, and think about what you find offensive. Then step into someone else's shoes that does not think it is offensive, and see if it is worth it to take it all away from everyone. Almost everything could be considered offensive to at least one person, but it is your own resposibility to decide whether it is appropriate for you or your child. The shelves should stay full of books, movies, music and magazines, providing access to diverse perspectives and viewpoints. It is our way of expressing freedom of speech, and that is an integral part of our country and our culture.
1658	4635	2	3	
1659	4636	2	3	People should have a right to listen, read, and watch whatever they want. It is people's own choice to what they read, watch, or listen to, as personal preference is a fundamental aspect of individual freedom. They will not be able to change that person by taking out offensive movies or books; they will only go somewhere else and do it, perhaps seeking it out even more deliberately. People have a right to read, listen to, and watch what they feel is good for them. If others find that offensive then that is their problem, because what one person deems offensive, another may find insightful or thought-provoking. People make their own decisions and that is their right, a right that should be protected and respected. I feel that if you tell someone that they can not do a certain thing that will only make them want to do it more, creating a rebellious urge driven by the restriction itself.  Taking offensive books, music, movies, and magazines will not solve a problem that our society has with being offensive to others; it will only mask it, creating a false sense of progress without addressing the underlying issues. Taking them out will not all of a sudden make people stop being offensive to others; they just won't do it in libraries, potentially moving such behavior to less regulated spaces. Every book, music or movie will be offensive to some other person, because different people have varying sensitivities and perspectives. If we take all the offensive stuff out there will be nothing left to read, as art often pushes boundaries and challenges societal norms. It is just something that we will have to deal with, learning to engage with diverse content and perspectives constructively. So I do not agree with censorship in libraries.  It will only take away our right to read and view what we want, limiting access to information and diverse viewpoints, but also it will take away all the offensive movies and books we have; which is almost every book, since offense is subjective and varies from person to person. Everyone feels that one book or another if offensive to them and if we take away those books we will have nothing left in our libraries, ultimately diminishing the value and purpose of these institutions. Therefore, censorship in libraries is detrimental to intellectual freedom and the pursuit of knowledge.
1660	4637	2	3	Censorship: No, I don't think they should take certain books off the shelves. There are a lot of things out there that can be found offensive: gangs, politics, race, even school that small children go to. I can understand wanting to shelter your children, but you can't keep them from everything. Inner cities have gangs that write awful words on trains, buildings, and about anything they possibly can. And you can't just take that off the shelf. Politics can be the worst; during presidential elections, they are always bringing up the color of skin, and about everything they can find out about the other person. All of your kids watch this on TV. Race wars can get bad; people all around the world are fighting just because of the color of their skin. You can't hide them from it either; it's an ongoing battle that will never be won, and it will keep getting worse. I can't speak for other schools, but mine has a lot of little problems: little kids cussing, the older kids fighting, then there are the people that try to do good in school and get picked on for it. You can't hide your kids forever; sooner or later, they will find out about these problems. If you want to help your kids, keep them off the streets, because reading it in a book is a lot better than them seeing it in the real world. You have to prepare them for the problems ahead, and if you don't, then they might get hurt a lot worse than by the little words in a book, a magazine, or movies, because real-world experience can be harsh.
1661	4638	2	3	In the book Fahrenheit 451, all books get burned no matter what they contain and the people are always sad and depressed about everything. Books are an important part of our lives. Some materials do need to be censored because it might offend some people that already have a hard time with being who they are without these things to add to the flame. There are some books that are being censored for little to no reason. There might be a rude or a misunderstood word that caused books to be unnecessarily censored. Censorship is important to libraries when used correctly.  We need books for many things, from learning to simply use up time. Music has been with mankind since the beginning. Movies show us the ups and downs of life. Magazines inform us on what is new and interesting. These things have become important to us as clothes and food. Simply taking these out will make the world a darker place to live.  Some of these things will cause people to be offended without trying to be. Katherine Paterson says that if I had the right to get rid of a book that offended me, then everyone can too, and soon all of the books will be gone. We can try to be nice to everyone, but at some point, something will insult someone no matter what we do or say; therefore, we shouldn't eliminate valuable resources simply because offense is possible.
1662	4639	2	3	What is censorship? Many would say it's a book without cuss words or it's a movie without racism. For me, I think censorship is covering up the truth. I don't think movies or books should be taken off the self because some people find it offensive. When a book uses a cuss word to show anger or simply use the word, I think that it's okay because isn't that what we hear in the world already? Now I know some people may not have grown up hearing foul words but many of us have. With movies I think that if people have a problem with their children watching something bad or offensive then they shouldn't let their kid watch it. Thats whats wrong with people now a days, they don't want to take blame for things that go wrong in their lives. People use censorship as a way to make themselves feel like their a good parent or that the world owes them something. When it comes to someone thinking that a movie or book has gone to far with their race then censorship gets thrown around. Many people have issues with their race or nationality being messed with. Though it's funny to see that race use those foul words among themselves but when it's in a book it's racism. Or when a certain race is being made fun of or shown in a movie in a way that that race doesn't feel comfortable with, that movie is called racist. I feel that if people have an issue with something they don't agree with, then they should take it out of their own lives. Too many people try to control something, like cencorship. For years now people have wanted books that are read in school to be censored for bad language. Why put all that time toward the book being censored and not the school. I know kids in school use foul language all the time. Even worse then the books we read. If adults would realize it's their kids they need to censore and not the books then censorship wouldn't have become such a huge issue. People need to just realize that by cencoring the books or movies doesn't make the offencive words or bad images go away, it just covers them up, so the focus should shift from external censorship to personal responsibility and education, allowing individuals to make informed choices about the media they consume.
1663	4640	2	3	Taking books off a shelf at libraries because someone thinks they are offensive? I don't think that is right. That's just what one person thinks and other people I'm sure won't think the same way. Just because one person thinks something is offensive and should be taken off that shelf doesn't mean that some kid couldn't learn from that book. Also with music, movies, and magazines, well you can get that everywhere else, sometimes even easier, so why is it such a bad thing to have it at a library? A lot of kids go to libraries to find books they need for school, and if people are taking books off the shelf that they need, then how are they supposed to get their work done? I'm sure there are people out there that would say the books they need are something they shouldn't be learning yet, but we are going to have to learn about it sometime, so why not now? Taking away music? kids can just get on the internet and get that just as easily, and most kids are doing it in ways that could get them in trouble. So having music at libraries is just giving them a free and legal way to get it. Magazines you could just go to a store and get, but a lot of kids probably don't have the money to buy them, so having them at a library would give them a way to be able to see them. As long as it is stuff that kids can see then I don't see what is wrong with libraries having them there. So I think taking books, music, magazines, and movies away from libraries isn't a very good thing to do, especially since libraries often serve as important community hubs. Maybe they could make an adult area, and if someone tells them they think a book should go in there, then they can look over it and see if it should. I can see some stuff getting taken away, but not very much, and if you take all that away from a library, then you don't really have much of a library anymore, and that limits access to information and resources for everyone.
1664	4641	2	3	I think if something is offensive, it shouldn't be available for kids until they are old enough to read or listen to it. I think such materials need to be removed from shelves or put away. This is because it can be hurtful or inappropriate for younger kids, and this exposure could be prevented if these items are not readily accessible. I believe magazines could be put away or placed in designated sections. Music and movies could also be put in their own sections. Furthermore, internet access could be restricted by blocking certain websites. Fortunately, we live in a time where adults and other responsible individuals can help prevent these things from happening. These people can watch over children and guide them away from content that is unsuitable for their age. This is what I think; it could be easily prevented by simply putting offensive materials up or removing them from shelves, so we don't have to worry about our children being exposed to them.
1665	4642	2	3	Dear Newspaper, I would like to start off by saying that books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are great for kids in libraries. It's great that kids have a place to go in their free time when they have nothing else to do or need a place to read. But some things are not suitable for young kids and young adults. In high school just walking down the hall you will find out more things than you would probably like to know. Many of them might not be appropriate but whenever you walk into the library it's almost as if they are promoting drugs, alcohol, and sex. Books about drugs are okay to a certain extent, like if they are medicinal drugs or present factual information. But whenever they are talking about how drugs take the pain away and make everything better, that's when it's taken too far. Our kids and future kids do not need to be learning about these sort of things in a positive light. Alcohol is the same way. You see alcohol everywhere and kids are doing it at a young age because movies, music, books, etc. are promoting it basically. Our kids do not need to be learning about these sorts of things. We need them to learn about the dangers of alcohol, not how to get drunk and what you do when you're drunk. Advertisements are the worst things that kids could be seeing especially when they are on billboards, fronts of magazines, etc. Kids do not need to be learning these things at such a young age. Kids should be persuaded to play outside and be in sports and have fun with the family or ride their bike. I feel that these things should be taken out of libraries if they are offensive to some people. Because maybe it's for the best that these things are taken off shelves because maybe our kids will be healthier and live longer without being influenced or under pressure about doing drugs and alcohol, etc., and therefore, libraries should prioritize safeguarding the well-being of young patrons. Sincerely, [Name]
1666	4643	2	3	I am sending this letter to you about my views on censorship in libraries. Some people think books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are offensive. Those things might be offensive to them, but not to other people. So you have to look at it in not only your point of view but other people point of view. I think they should not remove these things from the shelves. Everyone has a different point of view like my mom for instence she likes vampire books and movies, but i like tragedy. See everyone likes something different. They also have to think to the books we have from @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM2, etc., are offensive to some people. Are we going to take those books out to. I mean if we took books, music, movies, magazines, etc., out for being offensive then we would not have any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. Everyone thinks something offensive, some might think the same thing is offensive some might thing something different is offenseive. We should not take books, music, movies, magazines, etc., off the shevles. I understand that people do not want there kids to see them or hear them. It part of life though. You can not take everything out to please one person, because it could make another person mad. We need to consider the broader implications of censorship and respect the diverse perspectives within our community, ensuring that libraries remain a place of open access and intellectual freedom for all.
1667	4644	2	3	Libraries are normally safe, quiet places where people can drink coffee, read, search the internet, or listen to music. However, some individuals disrupt this environment, disrespecting others who seek solitude, perhaps after a difficult day or while their children are away, needing to regroup. This leads to the question: why do people choose to read at the library instead of checking out materials? What's the significance of borrowing books, CDs, magazines, and movies? It might seem insignificant, but most counties offer public libraries, accessible to anyone. To prevent theft and manage borrowed items, libraries often require personal information such as a phone number, address, or credit card number, along with a signed agreement outlining borrowing terms and due dates. Late fees are common, but often ignored, leading to unreturned items and unpaid charges; therefore, charging late fees to a credit card would ensure payment, as people can easily ignore phone calls or mailed notices. Our school library at @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, constantly struggles with unreturned books and unpaid fees, a perpetual problem with some individuals who simply don't care. The internet access is a different issue, as not everyone can afford home internet. This is not a complaint, but a sharing of ideas to maintain functional and well-used libraries within the county and @LOCATION1. Implementing these ideas can help ensure that libraries remain valuable resources for everyone in the community.
1668	4645	2	3	People find things offensive everyday; it's a fact of life. Some have a right to feel offended for legitimate reasons, though offense itself is often unavoidable. It has occurred for thousands of years, and people have slowly learned to deal with it. Therefore, books and other materials found offensive should not be removed simply because they offend someone, as doing so could offend someone else. The core point is that universal happiness is impossible; life is filled with diverse perspectives and emotions, so complete agreement is unattainable. Libraries, having purchased these materials, should have the autonomy to decide whether to remove them, allowing the public to access them. However, they should also strive to minimize certain offensive content, particularly racism, which continues to significantly impact the country and remains an ongoing problem. In conclusion, libraries have the right to own somewhat offensive books or movies because offense is a common experience, and universal happiness is unachievable. This material is most likely educational and teaches us about the history of the world, the country, etc., rather than being racist or offensive as everyone jumps to conclusions about. Everyone needs to move past taking offense so readily and strive for a level of understanding where we see eye-to-eye, recognizing that we are all fundamentally the same, despite our differences in appearance and culture.
1669	4646	2	3	The libraries are made for everyone, from children to adults. There @MONTH1 might be somethings that should not be in certain areas or even in the place at all. With the libraries having all age groups of books there, there @MONTH1 might or should not be some material in those areas for them to see, let alone @MONTH1 might not even be there to begin with. Any age of children can pick up a material that @MONTH1 might contain either offensive content or just some things that they should not see. I think that libraries should only contain materials that are appropriate for all age groups. This is my opinion why I think libraries should only have materials with appropriate images and words for all age groups. You don't know what your or someone else's child @MONTH1 might pick up and read or hear. The best thing to do is have all appropriate materials and nothing else, ensuring a safe and suitable environment for all.
1670	4647	2	3	Should certain books, movies, and magazines be removed from library bookshelves if found offensive? I believe that libraries should remove materials that are offensive. Libraries are huge public places that share knowledge and entertainment to enormous groups of people who want to expand their knowledge. Throughout the @LOCATION1 and other countries there are libraries that hold offensive material. Now I strongly believe in throwing out these offensive items because little children could grab one in their hands, there could be people that can be influenced to do stupid activities that they have learned, and some people might steal these items for themselves. These materials can lead to negative consequences.  Libraries are important resources that tons of different groups of people come to enjoy, relax, and think. Now all over the countries libraries have offensive material that should be removed from their shelves. Little children and their parents come to the library because a library is a great way to relieve stress and to let children learn. Say there are materials that are not suitable for children so they grab it and started reading. Next thing you know your children will have that type of knowledge and you can't do a thing about it. Offensive material are around little kids and parent don't even know. They could gain offensive language or talk about it at school and that material could spread. Material like that at the library can harm children brains by brainwashing them.  Teenagers are becoming of age to where they might do something regrettable. Teens often go to the library to meet up with friends, or start on homework. Then a person who is immature spots a book and begins to read. After that he or she thought that it was extremely funny and wants to try it at home, but then gets badly hurt. Teens can be influenced by anything and what's worse is that it can start at the library.  Then there are people who just come into a library and steal the offensive material for themselves. People like that are immature and could serve a real problem for the library. Once having that item in their grasp; they could post it on the internet and show the whole world what he or she found. Offensive material could be easily stolen from a library; if these certain items were not at the library then rebels wouldn't be stealing anything from the library.  Libraries are for different people who want to learn and teach others about their newly obtained knowledge. Libraries have the absolute best resources a place could have or ever wanted. I don't want such a wonderful resource be tainted by these obscene materials, which could potentially create unsafe environments. That is why I strongly believe that certain material such as books, magazines, movies, and music that are offensive should be removed from libraries.
1671	4648	2	3	Some people believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. However, I do not believe they should be removed. People are mature enough to be able to handle offensive material. Most people check out books or movies that they have heard about, so for the most part they know what they are reading may be offensive. Instead of removing the offensive material, there should just be a warning to let readers know that what they are checking out is considered offensive. These days, people are mature enough to read offensive material. We see many types of offensive material every day. Examples of this include when we watch the news, we often see numerous offensive pictures or videos. There are also many news stories that many people consider offensive. When a person checks out an offensive book, they are doing so because they want to. Libraries should not revoke a reader's right to read what he/she wants. Before a person checks out a book or movie, they should look into it to make sure they are okay with what they are getting. This can prevent many problems. For example, say a young reader sees a book that they think looks interesting. If they don't read into it a little bit and just take it home, they may later find that it contains offensive material. However, if they read a little bit about it before they check it out, they will find out it contains offensive material, and can then make the decision on whether or not they still want to read it. There are many ways libraries can prevent children or other people not mature enough to view the offensive material from seeing it. They can put a warning label on the book or movie to inform people that that particular item is considered offensive. Libraries could even put an age limit on checking out offensive material. Either of these ideas could be an effective way to ensure that only mature people are checking out anything that is considered to be offensive. Libraries should not have to remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that contain offensive material from the shelves. If a person wants to check out a book that is offensive, they should be allowed to check it out and read it. Also, people should be intelligent enough to look into whatever item they are checking out beforehand so they can be aware of the offensive material. However, to make things even easier, libraries could just put a warning label on offensive material to prevent some people from reading it, thus allowing for both freedom of choice and a level of protection.
1672	4649	2	3	Censorship in libraries today, I believe, are not a big problem. But many would disagree with that. Books and movies can be a very important resource for anyone of any age. They can give us facts about a certain topic that we might not find any where else. Everyone has their own definition of offensive. I believe that it is not only up to the library to rate the books, movies, and magazines offensive but it is also up to the participants using these resources. For many kids, no matter what age, they only rent books from a library for two main reasons: pleasure and projects. To censor a book from a teenager or child is just like more of an invitation to see whats inside of it. For the people who do pleasure reading they most of the time stick to only one type of genre. If someone wanted to rent a book, and it was not appropriate for them to read, then the librarian or teacher would restrict that book from them. For projects, such as for school, it would depend upon the librarian to censor the book to a child. But books are not rated such as movies are. So it really all depends upon the use of the book and the maturity of the person who is renting it. If they feel that it will not be appropriate for some, then they could give a suggestion to censor it. Movies and books are different in many ways. Books allow you to create a mental description and picture in your mind for what you are reading. Movies, on the other hand, create a visual image right in front of your eyes. No matter how gruesome or vile of a description a book can give, it still does not compare with the visual picture of a video. Movies are rated today as to the age of a person, and they say why they are rated as such. Movies rated above the R level are most of the time not held in libraries. They might still be censored if they create too vile of an image, but that is up to the one who watches it. Music is a major part of each one of our lives, and without it the world would be a much different place. Everyone finds themselves quite fond of a certain genre of music, and most of the time sticks to it. Music, like movies, is also rated by the content of the song. If it has a word or two that should be sensored, then it is most likely already labeled 'explicit'. I think that music, just like movies, should not be able to be censored, because they are already rated accordingly. Some books, magazines, and movies contain cold hard facts about the past years of our world and are too vile for anyone. And even though those events are in our past they are still very important to our present. Books can be a magical place for children, as well as adults, to go and create their own world. To censor a book, movie, or magazine would be taking away that chance for someone to enjoy life just a little bit more for that small moment in time. Therefore, we should trust individuals to make their own choices about what they consume, fostering critical thinking and a more informed understanding of the world around them.
1673	4650	2	3	My opinion on this subject is its not right. This is a very interesting question. And im going to tell you why i think the way i do. Im for it and against it. Okay some people like different things and the other people dont agree on it. Thats how things work. If a parent is walking his kid through the mall and goes into a music store and hears the music cussing in it i would not want my kid to be around that and thats what it means by removing something like that because somebody is offened. I totally agree on that. Like ciggerettes. Kids walk in to go buy candy then they go to pay for it and the back wall is full of tobacco products that the kids can see. Once again i would want to remove that from the shelfs. There would be so many conflicts if this happened. Everyone likes different things. So i think everyone is going to get offened by taking things away that looks offensive towards them. This goes from kids to adults. Every age would be bothered by this. Now this is my against veiw on this subject. This would make me very mad if i admired something a lot and then come to find out that someone is offened by it so they take it away from the people and that like that object. All this would do is cause problems for everybody and just make everything go bad. Thats how its suppost to be. We all have are opinions. We all like different things. We all have to get over it if we dont like it or dont get along with it. Thats something we have to take in and suck it up. So on this subject im for both. I see it both ways because its good and bad. Ultimately, people are just going to have to get over the fact that they have to deal with what they see or hear, because it is part of life and learning to coexist with different viewpoints is essential, even when those viewpoints cause offense.
1674	4651	2	3	I believe that certain materials should not be removed if they are found inappropriate. There are several things that explain why I think this. For one thing, some libraries don't have certain genres of books. For example, say one library may have action but not thriller while another library has thriller but not action. If some materials were removed from public libraries due to censorship, people would only be able to find it online or in certain stores. Second reason being that kids would not get into these kind of books if it was inappropriate, unless they're given approval by parents. If these materials were to still be on shelves, you should at least be a certain age to read it, unless the parents make it to where their kids don't have to get approval from them first. Sure it would make the library more kid-friendly, but a book shouldn't be kept away from a kid only because of a few bad words. Lastly, some adults would be upset of the removal of some books. Some books that are intended for adults would be better off staying in the library. If they were to remove these books, adults would then have to find a book online. So censorship, to me, is not going to make any difference. If this continues, it could lead so far, that the libraries would have to be closed. Take my word for it. In conclusion, don't let censorship take over our libraries, as it limits access and ultimately harms the purpose they serve.

When one is censored, they are essentially giving up the right of freedom of SPEECH. In this essay I will discuss three cons of censorship in libraries. One reason censorship should not be aloud in libraries is the lack of freedom of SPEECH. Decades ago when it was set into place that anyone was aloud to practice their right to speak freely, the idea of censorship was not in the plan. As AMERICANS, it is our right to speak and write however we want without reprocussions, however offensive or non-offensive the material MAY be. As AMERICANS all should realize that everyone is different and not everyone will agree with one another. Does that mean that just because one person finds something offensive, then an item should be taken off shelves? Absolutley not. Freedom of SPEECH is our birth right and we should be aloud to say or write anything without being censored. '...But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson. Author Katherine Paterson simply states that if she has the right to take any book of the shelf that she doesn't like, then everyone else also has that same right. As previously stated in the paragraph above, it makes no sense to rid a book just because one person finds it offensive. If that was the case, I could find 20 books in our library that I find offensive, and the next person could find 30 books that are offensive and so on. Just as Katherine states, 'And then we have no books left on the shelves for any of us.' And the last con of censorship in libraries is the lack of perspective and learning a book brings. As an avid book reader, I couldn't even begin to describe all of the vocabulary words and new things I learn from reading one book. Just recently I read the book THE HELP. As I was reading, I began to have a deep hatred of the main character. Later I found that the book was incredibly offensive. However, from reading it, the book provided much insight into 1960's life that I new nothing about. It gave me a great deal of information that to this day, I use. The book made me reflect on myself and how 60 plus years changes people, AMERICANS more specifically. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is not a good idea. When one is censored they give up their right of freedom of SPEECH, other books in general, and loss of oppotunity to learn new things. Hopefully with this essay, I have persuaded you or at least informed you on the cons of censorship in libraries.
1676	4653	2	3	Is there enough censorship in our libraries? Have you ever came across a vulgar or offensive book in your library and hoped that no children had ever read it? Well that should never happen; if a book or any other material is offensive then it should be put in a seperate area of the library where only adults can access it. Other than that section their should not be any offensive or vulgar materials that children or even early teenagers should be able to see.  Almost everyday children and teenagers have access to offensive and vulgar materials that could have terrible effects on them. Maybe if they do not see these offensive materials when they are young they will be less likely to use or engage in some of the things that they see or read. For example when teenagers read about people doing drugs that could influence them to engage in those type of activities as well. The materials might not have an effect right away but later on down the road it could have a giant effect on them. Such exposure could potentially normalize harmful behaviors and contribute to future problems.  The youth is what is going to be running this country when we are old. So we need to do our part and take offensive and vulgar materials out of the reach of our children and teenagers. I do not want my children to read some of the things that I read when I was young. That is why I believe their should be censorship in every library, ensuring a safer and more positive learning environment for our young people.
1677	4654	2	3	I think that every book in the world should be on the shelf, because if it is offensive then don't read it. It is a lot better if you can go read any book you want to, and if they don't have that book then I guess you got to go get it somewhere else, and some people wouldn't go through all that trouble for a book. Which means they won't know as much as they wanted to or could have known. We need smart people to know as much as their potential and as they want and can possibly know, because knowledge is power. But books are books, not everybody reads a lot of books. Let's say you wanted to know something about a truck, what do you do? You go find a book about it or get online or ask somebody that knows. How would anybody know anything about it if the person that built the truck didn't write a book telling you about the truck? You would have to take it apart and find out yourself, which isn't very easy at all, and if you mess up that's not good. But if you had a book to go by it makes things a lot simpler most of the time. This is one of the reasons every book should be on the shelf, so that if you need to know something and you want to learn you can read about it and find out what you want to know. Reading is one of the best ways to find out what you are looking for so that way nobody is telling you wrong, and allows you to form your own conclusions. Plus books are just good to read. All movies should be there too because everybody has the right to watch any movie they want, unless they aren't of age, and if no parent has to say it's okay for them to watch it. If it offends you, don't watch it. Magazines are good too. I read a lot of magazines. You can find a lot about anything in a magazine, so yeah, they are good. Ultimately, access to diverse materials promotes learning and informed decision-making.
1678	4655	2	3	No, I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed for being offensive. My opinion on the varieties of things found in our library are good. Most of it is very helpful information. Some people might not like some things because of what they have in it or on them, but most of it is history, and you can't change that. If someone doesn't like a book, movie, or magazine, they shouldn't read it. I have found the things in our libraries to really help on a lot of projects. If we need to know about slaves or slavery, we can go to our library. Some peoples views on that is totally different, but hey, we can't help what people did in the past. We can only learn from their mistakes. I say if you don't like what you see on the front of the cover, don't read it; look for something else more interesting to you. I have not found one thing in our library offensive to me, or even bad. They have books over everything. Some of it can be bad, but mostly it all is good information. They talk about history, and guns and drugs, and wars and all sorts of other historical information. There are even books over stuff that isn't even true. I think people overreact on some things. If you don't like a book or movie, don't get it. Look at the cover, and if it seems appealing, get it, but if not, don't waste time complaining about it, because then things can get out of control. That is my opinion on books, movies, magazines, etc., in our libraries. Mainly, they seem very helpful, but others can have different opinions, and it is important to respect those varying viewpoints.
1679	4656	2	3	I believe no books should be removed from library shelves. While some content may be offensive to certain individuals, others might require those same materials for research, projects, or simply to understand different perspectives. Reading can foster understanding of why certain things are considered offensive. Every book should remain accessible in public libraries, allowing individuals the freedom to choose for themselves and decide what they find offensive. An author might write about gangsters and their children to offer insight into a specific life.  We live in a diverse world with varied outlooks. An author might aim to illustrate a child's experiences with violence and killings. This shouldn't be deemed offensive simply because it depicts such themes. Reading it can provide understanding of that child's upbringing and potentially influence gang members to reconsider the impact of their choices on their children.  I believe the same principle applies to movies and magazines. These mediums can be enlightening. Someone involved in a gang, through movies and reading, might realize the potential consequences of their actions. These books, movies, and magazines could serve as cautionary tales, illustrating the potential outcomes of harmful paths.  Why should certain individuals decide what is offensive for others? The solution is to keep all books on public library shelves. Let readers decide what is right or offensive for themselves. Any decision a library makes will inevitably upset someone. The only way to address this issue is to empower individuals to read and decide for themselves. If they enjoy a book, great; if not, they can simply return it and avoid it in the future. Ultimately, only you can decide what is right or wrong for yourself.
1680	4657	2	3	Some children take books off the shelf that some old people can't read now a days. Some people take books off and take them and break them, taking pages off of them. Such actions damage valuable resources and disrespect the knowledge contained within.
1681	4658	2	3	Hello @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing to talk about censorship in libraries. In libraries they have tons of materials that have language and images that are offensive. I have a broad view on this subject. My view is just that if they censor stuff in a library, they should censor tv. I have deaf parents, so we always have the captions on in our house. Everyday I see bad language that's not censored on tv. I also have seen images that are not censored on tv. The youth of this time mostly watch tv than use the library. So why not censor tv shows and movies too? I see things on tv that I won't see in a library. In conclusion, I don't believe that libraries should censor their materials because students will still find out about the content elsewhere. There are plenty of other places that are arguably worse. Crime scenes, for example, have blood and gore, but a library would just have language. These are my views, and yours could be different, but the focus should be on addressing the broader issue of media content exposure for young people.
1682	4659	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson, an author, once said. I think that she was trying to tell us that some books should not be out on the shelves for children to read. I agree with her on that statement. I have once read a book with very mature content. It was very vulgar and not suitable for my age or maturity. There are a lot of books like that out there and we need to hide them from the children of our society. They are too young to hear or read about adult actions such as: war, violence, sex, drugs, and all sorts of other things. If we take these mature books and other types of media off the shelves our children will have better lives. There would be less teen pregnancies, drug usage, and multiple other factors that are affecting our society. Children would behave better because they would not be so greatly influenced by the media. I think that we shouldn't get rid of these books though. We should just keep them out of the libraries. If people want to read these kinds of books they should search elsewhere. An easy way to solve this problem is to put an age limit on books and media of this content and to put them in a separate store or section in the libraries. A very great author said that children should not be exposed to adult content in the media. But she also said that the people who read or watch this type of media have every right to. This is why there needs to be an age limit on this type of media. But for now if the content is too adult for you or does not agree with you, don't read or watch it, but also recognize that others have the freedom to make different choices.
1683	4660	2	3	We have all been to a library at some point in our life. Have you ever been looking around and seen something that might have been offensive, or something you didn't agree with? What if you had the chance to have it taken off the shelves for good? Or, what if someone else had the choice to? Would you allow them to do so? In my opinion, I would say no. Someone does not have the right to take reading material off the shelves, just because it might be offensive to them, or their way of life. I say, if you do not like it, do not look at it, it is simple as that. For example, what if you were into rap, or the hip hop culture, and someone finds that offensive? Would you give them the right to keep it from you? Or, would you really want to do that to someone else? Let's say you are a Christian, and an atheist finds the bible offensive, or untruthful, so he has it taken off the shelves. Does that sound fair to you? If someone was to not like a certain topic or culture, or finds it offensive, all they would have to do, is simply stay away from it. The library is a place of knowledge and diverse perspectives, so removing content based on personal offense would undermine its very purpose. The point is, if we all were to take something off the shelves, there would eventually be nothing left. Respect what other cultures and ways of life do, and stay away from what offends you. Would you like someone to have what you like taken off the shelves? I would not, so you should not do that to other people, and allowing diverse viewpoints to remain ensures freedom of thought and access to information for everyone.
1684	4661	2	3	It seems today we attempt to censor everything, but are we going too far? Could it be that we have crossed the line and are no longer protecting the children, but are instead holding back our society as a whole? In my opinion, censorship of literature has crossed the line. A library is, essentially, an incredibly valuable resource to each generation. In some cases it still is, but when books are being withheld due to the fact that it might offend someone we are holding people back from the knowledge they could gain from the work of literature itself. We attempt to placate everyone in today's society, therefore we censor several things that are not politically correct. If future generations are unable to learn what we have through these writings, then they will lack the insight we had gained.  Another reason is, to be perfectly honest, history and society have not - and very well may never truly be - politically correct. People take umbrage to certain words and consequently some libraries will remove the book featuring said words from their shelves. After this is done, what have we really accomplished?  Have we made the world a better place by attempting to hide a part of history? That is debatable, but by the same token, in school we must learn about the Holocaust despite the fact that it upsets many people. We must learn about this because it was an important part in history that needs to be remembered in hopes that nothing so terrible as that will ever happen again. So, if we learn about an entire subject which happened in another country but affected the entire world, should we not learn about our own faults in history? The times we have oppressed people, the terms we used so commonly we attempt to hide now.  Has it really helped us? No, for until people recognize a problem and furthermore are reminded of how wrong it was they will not understand it. Napoleon once said that history is a story written by the victor, but is victory so sweet after our history has been rewritten?  If everything that offends people is censored or taken away we will have nothing left. For if one person is allowed to say what is and isn't acceptable then others will partake in this as well. It would become a new fad and people would find a problem with just about anything.  So, essentially, by censoring works in libraries we are holding back the future generations from all that they could be. We are forcing them to be ignorant of society's problems. In the end we must ask ourselves, was it really worth it? I remind you, a library is an invaluable resource; therefore, we must carefully consider the long-term consequences of limiting access to information in the name of avoiding offense.
1685	4662	2	3	When people think of a library they think of a quiet place to study and read. Teachers use the libraries for many different things. One thing they use it for is movies on certain topics. Another is for books on certain people or events. They even use it to get magazines for projects and to catch up on the world outside of school. So what is my opinion on offensive materials getting removed? I'll tell you what it is. Kids watch movies in class all the time. Some are not appropriate at times, but some are very insiteful and helpful. I think if the teacher watches the movie first and thinks that it is too bad for children in say elementary it should be banned from that schools library, but for high schoolers chances are they have heard or seen worse. So with saying that movies should stay in the libraries of high schools but not all should stay in the elementary's. Books are another good resource if used correctly. They help kids in history learn about old war hero's and past events. Some books should be kept behind the counter and only used for certain classes though. Like for instance books that tell specifics about drugs. They should be taken off the shelves , put behind the counter; and if someone really needs a book about them like for medicine purposes to become a doctor then all they have to do is ask. Magazines are good for a couple of different nice things. One thing is projects. If you have to do a project over something like food and cant use a computer, magazines are a great way to get good pictures. Another thing its commonly used for is just flat out entertainment. Like when you get bored of reading a book that you just picked out because of looks or if a book is too hard to read you could get a magazine. So in reality some things should be kept and others taken away. People spend lots of time in the library for many different things and that will never change. Movies are a good source of entertainment and that won't change either. So I guess i'm half and half on keeping or getting rid of offensive materials, because context and age appropriateness are key factors in determining what should be available.
1686	4663	2	3	My view opposes the open distribution of certain newspaper articles. There are certain articles, radio shows, and other sources of media that vividly describe certain things that happen in the news that I find not to be appropriate for some people to hear such as younger children, or people that don't agree with having to listen to things such as: bias reactions, opinions, and interpretations of these things. Open distribution of newspaper articles and things containing disturbing images ought to be censored. I recently seen photos of people who have been killed in the process of finding @LOCATION1. I find that these images @MONTH1 serve some importance to people interested, but for children who can look on their doorstep and look at the newspaper, can see horrifying images that some people @MONTH1 think they shouldn't be exposed to. Even as adults people don't necessarily agree with it. Adults @MONTH1 see what's in the news and @MONTH1 find it to be intriguing as it pertains to them or fairly disturbing, but as far as the protection and limited exposure their children @MONTH1 have, it @MONTH1 not be such a good thing for their kids to be hearing. I was in the car heading back from school one day, and my dad had just picked me up from school, and I casually switch the raido from am to fm as I always do when I get in the car, but I didn't hear the sudden outbreak of a top one hundred song as I had expected, I heard a woman asserting her opinion about the death of @LOCATION1 to a talk radio show host. The show had previously been recorded, and so after the woman had lashed out for being so angry about the whole thing, there was a review of other calls that other people had made in mad frustration about the womans' comments. She had said earlier that it was wrong to have killed somebody, in which the talk radio show host responded with the argument that it was okay for @LOCATION1 to kill thousands, but we can't kill him argument. The reviews that the other callers had made sort of disturbed me. The things that the callers were saying were very offensive towards the woman who had expressed her feelings. The other callers were saying that she needed to get out of our country, and were cursing at her. News like the death of @LOCATION1 isn't just violent in itself, but creates reactions that are very violent as well. Another instance when I was exposed to some information that @MONTH1 not have been well accepted by others was when we were having an assembly meeting at my school, and we watched a video about a protest that was against people of @CAPS1 belief. The whole problem with the protest was that the people of the @CAPS1 faith were born in @LOCATION3, and were meeting with representatives in order to help a poor community in @LOCATION2. Although they were making an effort to help the poor communities, and homeless people in @LOCATION2 there were people shouting at the im protest to leave, and to go back to where they came from. When people hear things about this in the news it can be very offensive, because although it @MONTH1 be happening on a complete opposite coast, it would be able to effect someone, it can easily effect someone who doesn't understand previous conflicts that would shape these peoples' opinions and @MONTH1 take that very offensively, because it is a very complex matter even though it is still very wrong. I believe that the material that is being exposed to people of all ages should be censored, because the material that is being openly distributed now isn't necessarily suitable for everyone, and some people @MONTH1 not want to hear about it, and want to avoid the news that is going around about certain topics that they @MONTH1 not be comfortable with. Therefore, some level of censorship is necessary to protect vulnerable individuals and foster a more considerate media environment for everyone.
1687	4664	2	3	I think that if a book can be published then it should be able to be in a library. If a book is published then it means it's open to the public so I don't see why it can't be in the libraries. If a book has to be removed from a library then why did they buy it? I really don't see the need to take a book off the shelf in a library. If someone dosen't like it then they don't have to get it. I beleive that only the owner of the library should be the only one to take a book off a shelf because it is their own store, but why would they waste the money in buying the book in the first place if they didn't want it there. The public shouldn't be able to remove books from libraries because not everyone likes the same kind of books, and libraries are meant to have diverse options. Everyone has different views also. If anyone could remove books from libraries then there wouldnt be any books in the library. A book is a book. Not a criminal so why remove books from libraries? If a book can be published then it can be put in libraries. There is no reason for a book to be taken off the shelf because its been published so it's already open to the public, and people can choose whether or not they want to read it.
1688	4665	2	3	I don't think a magazine should be taken off the shelves just because someone is offended. People get offended all the time, but do you see them trying to get whatever it is that made them feel like that removed from existence? I have been offended by cartoons before, but you don't see me crying about it; you just have to suck it up and go on with life. Cartman from the TV show South Park is one of the most offensive characters on that show. He uses every offensive language known to mankind. He makes fun of all the races; he says he hates everyone equally. But still, you can't stop it; that is like trying to get a dog to be a cat, it just won't happen. It is also like trying to get rid of racism. Therefore, banning something simply because it is offensive is not the right approach.
1689	4666	2	3	When you walk into your local library there are thousands of books, magazines, movies, etc. You have different types and styles of books. There are fiction and nonfiction, comedy, horror, children books, and many more. Also what you might not know is some libraries have books that are either sexual, violent, disruptive, and aren't appropriate for young children. They could also have movies and magazines like that and that is not a good influence. When a young child walks into a library, they would expect to find a book with color, action, pictures, etc. But while they're browsing around they could run into a certain book thats not meant for them and they could end up becoming influenced. A book that is inappropriate for a child could possibly affect a childs life because they could go out into reality and try to immitate a book they have read and it could end up being the wrong decision. Inappropriate movie and magazines, such as pornagraphic magazines or pictures, rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 movies, shouldn't be allowed in a library. Items like that should be sold in a separate store. Items like these are meant for adults only. We should try to inspire our young children to do whats right and not try to convince them to do anything in a negative way. If you are going to have any of these items kept in your home, then keep them in a place where children can not find them. The generation that we live in now, most young people only focus on gang violonce, sex, rap music, and drugs and you can find all of this material in movies, books, and songs. If we keep all of these negative minded items out of public places such as libraries and even homes, then there could possibly be some change. Most rap songs you hear these days are either talking about violence, sex, or drugs. Most music should have a positive message to it. I feel if I see a book, movie, magazine, etc., sitting on a shelf where a young person can see it, I feel I should have the right to remove it because society is not like what it use to be and if we make a change like this, then I feel a few things can change. Eventhough I'm still young I feel my teenage generation should stop all the violence and stop becoming influenced by everything they see or hear, and if we focus on the more important things in life, then this world can be a whole different place. Therefore, by being mindful of the materials available to young people, we can contribute to a more positive and constructive environment for their development.
1690	4667	2	3	Censorship in libraries can be a positive and negative thing. I think this because there can be some things that you might not want your children to read. But there also can be things that you do want them to read. Age groups can play a big role in censorship because there are things that you don't want to see a kid reading when he or she is young. But if it is censored then they will not even be able to read it when they get older. It all depends on what kind of things are in the books, music, movies, and magazines. If you find something offensive that you read in a book or saw in a magazine, to some people that might not be offensive at all. This is why I think that censorship can be good and bad. I am sure that there might be some things that you have read that wasn't offensive to you but it might still be offensive to others. Censorship in my opinion can be a good thing when the things that are in the book, movie, magazine, and music are not true and that might be offensive to more than a small group. Let's say that there are two books written about the same true topic. The first book's material is very well written and might have offensive material in it here and there. The second book is also well written but might not all be there, the whole story might not be the same as what happened because they censored it because it can't be in the library. Which would you rather read? Personally I would rather read the book that might have some offensive material but has the complete story of what happened.  Say you were the writer of a book and it took you a long time of hard work and dedication to finish the book and get it published. Would you want your book to be on the shelf at the library? I know I would but if your writing about something that happened in your life that could have been offensive to others they might not allow that book on the shelf of a library. If the things that are in the book are true or are in real life, than why show your children a book that isn't true? I'm not saying go get your child a war book and have them read it when they are very young. When reading a book that someone spent a long time and lots of hard work on you are looking into their perspective. Maybe their perspective of what happened is a lot different than yours, but that can be a good thing. Even with the offensive material, books, movies, magazines, and music can still be good to some people and bad to others.  I have went to libraries and found books that I was interested in and I think that some of them could be found offensive to others. If the contents of the book, movie, magazine, and the music are not true and can be found offensive then sure that should be censored. But if it is censored it should only be for a certain age group. I have also went and got books at the library that have true stories that can be found offensive by some people, but that doesn't mean it should be censored. A book that might have material in them that could be 'bad' for some people, that does not mean that after they read it they are going to go start using the same offensive language that could be in the book. It all depends on the person's perspective if they find a book offensive or that has some 'bad' material in it then don't read it, and find something that you wouldn't find offensive.  Overall the things that we read, watch, and listen to might not all be bad even if it has some offensive material in it. To some it can be bad, to others it can be part of their life. If I had a story to tell and I spent a long time working on it, I would want it to be read, seen, and heard. Censorship might be good for some and bad for others. If you are a person that always likes a happy ending then maybe censorship is good. But if you want the whole story that can be non-fiction or fiction then censorship is not for you, proving that the decision to censor is complex and deeply personal.
1691	4668	2	3	If they are offensive they should be taken off the shelves because the little kids wouldn't get them. And I think that they should not be there in the first place because almost everybody goes to the libraries. If I found them offensive, they would probably get shut down or whoever put them there would be fired. The kids should not see them or know about them at all. The offensive books, music, movies, magazines are not supposed to be found in libraries that kids go to.  I think that most people would be mad at the schools or the libraries because they got them. And most parents would go talk to the people that did that. But if that happened to me, if my kid came home with one of the offensive magazines or anything, I would ask them where they got it and then go to talk to the people that run it. And most of the people that found those things would be mad at the kids and it's not their problem that someone did that.  And the first thing they should do is have a 18 or older rating on the books, movies, magazines, and music if they are in the libraries. They should not be where the kids go and read books or anything like that. They should be where the people that are 18 or older get them, but I still think that they should not be in there. But if the offensive things are in libraries people should take them to court. Offensive books, movies, magazines, and music should be handled with care to protect children, and if all else fails, legal action might be necessary.
1692	4669	2	3	I do believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, or music should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The reason why is because there can be a lot of books, movies, or magazines in certain places like the library or stores that can involve offensive stuff, such as violence or other bad things. A lot of things can influence the reader if they read a book that is offensive or if a kid sees a movie that involves violence.  One reason I think that books should be removed from the shelves is if they are found offensive because what if the reader is reading the book and they find a word that offends them? Or what if they read a book and it talks about bad stuff? Or maybe a kid can read a book and can learn bad stuff. A lot of things can just occur while reading a book. And many people sometimes take it real offensive if the book talks about their religion, race, or anything that involves their personal life. That's why I think books should be removed off the shelf, so people will not get offended.  Another reason will have to be that if a kid or someone underage rents a movie or their parents rent the movie. Then the kid would probably want to see the movie and they would not know what the movie is about. The kid might see something that is bad or might see a lot of violence. Sometimes parents don't really realize what their kids are watching. So it's important for them to learn and watch for their kids. In movies anyone can see a lot of bad things that can affect or offend them. So I think that they should not have certain movies on the shelves that can harm or offend certain families or parents, especially their kids.  Magazines can also be found offensive to a lot of people. Whenever you go to the store you always see magazines on the shelves or somewhere else. It's either talking about singers, people divorcing, violence that occurs around the world, arrests, or it could even have bad images that anyone could see. Which would be something bad, especially if a little kid picks up a magazine that has something bad inside. That's why they shouldn't have magazines that have bad stuff in public. Or adults shouldn't buy certain types of magazines because they never know what their child can expect to see, further emphasizing the need for careful consideration.  So there are a lot of reasons why I think that people should remove certain books, movies, magazines, or anything that involves offensive stuff. All around the world you will see stuff that can offend you or anyone else just by seeing something in a movie, by listening to a song, or even by reading a book. It's just not a good idea of having stuff out there like that in certain places, like the library, stores, or anywhere else. Especially if there are people that take it really offensive when they see a title of a book that is bad or when they hear a song that has a lot of bad words. It's just wrong having stuff like that that can offend a lot of people. What if I read a book and it talks about my race or religion, would I take it offensive? People should ask themselves that, before they read a book or see a movie. So they will decide whether or not they should have books, magazines, or music removed from the shelves, ultimately leading to a more sensitive and considerate environment for everyone.
1693	4670	2	3	I do believe that certain books, movies, music, etc., should be removed. They should be put in a different position for children unable to find in the area, because certain materials in the objects listed can start off bad behavior.  In order to keep the objects from being found from childern is to set them in a different area. Some where childern are unable to reach, like in high areas like the top of the shelf, or the closet, maybe the attic. For better safe keepings place the certain objects you feel that can give childern bad ideas in a personal safe, where no one is able to get things out.  It is important for some items to be seen, listened to, or watched for older people. For example, books can provide pictures for childern to do things that arn't right in there cerent age. Music can talk about stuff that that person done, and make that child want to do it because they might think its cool cause the artist does it. For the magazines they show articals of rapper, actors, and other famous people doing somthing wrong, showing a bad example for the child. Now for the materials they should be hidden in a place where no child would think to look at, because the materials some times harm the child or maybe even put the child in the hospital.  From experience I have thouched or took some material I shouldn't have messed with and the outcome wasn't good. From that experience I've learned not to thouch with items I know not to mess with. This includes cleaning supplies or tools.  Thats why it is important to keep certain items from childern, because the outcome maynot be what you wanted. Serious actions might come from the objects, and later on come from the same child that either listed to, saw it, or looked at it, so make sure the items are safe from childern hands, minimizing potential harm and negative influences.
1694	4671	2	3	I think that certain things in libraries should be taken off shelves if found offensive but not all. One of these things is anything that undermines or degrades one's religious beliefs. Another thing could be anything involving racial stereotypes or obvious racial comments. Having anything containing this could spark conflict within or outside of the library. Another thing that could be, but not entirely, removed from library material could be books that express violent or criminal acts. This type of material should only be given to an older audience.  I think that anything that contains slander or judgement on another person's religious beliefs should be removed from library shelves. As time goes on people are taking religion more and more serious. With that being said I don't think anyone would want to read a book or watch a movie in which the things they believe in being made fun of or rejected. It might not seem like harmful material at first glance, but your opinion might change when your customers come back angry and frustrated about what they read and saw. It would be a better choice to avoid this conflict with your customers and keep this material out of your library, unless you want to deal with complaints and constant arguments.  Another thing that needs to be removed is racial material. Racism has been one the worlds largest problems, it affects us all no matter who it's against. Picture a book in your library that calls all black teens a problem or a book that says all arabians dangerous, racist isn't it? Now imagine if your customers were of one of those two ethnicities, it's not a good picture at all. Keeping these stereotypes and harmful sayings off library shelves is a great business choice and will keep all customers happy. The last thing we want is for a customer to say 'those people are racist!'.  Lastly I think books that express violent and criminal acts should be censored from minors. Kids always follow what they hear or what they see. Since they're still in that stage where they rarely do things in their own way they might mimic or copy things they see. Another problem that surrounds this is peer pressure which will get more and more children committing these acts. If this is to happen many parents will become outraged and blame the libraries for releasing this material to children. So the best choice would be to keep this material away from minors, if it is contained within your library. Ultimately, libraries must thoughtfully consider the potential harm of certain materials and make responsible decisions to ensure a safe and respectful environment for all patrons.
1695	4672	2	3	Many people I know would be very upset if there weren't any more books on the shelves of the library. I think there should be books that are offensive; who wants to read a book that is boring and not exciting? Libraries should have labels on the books, so when people go to check them out, the books would have a label that says this book might not be right for certain people and may contain bad language. That's just an example. There should be adult and children's sections in the library, maybe sections for every type of book, like murder and mystery. That also goes for the movies, music, and magazines, ensuring diverse content for all interests. I love going through the books in the library; you never know what to expect out of a book, and a well-organized and labeled system would only enhance that exploration.
1696	4673	2	3	Do you think we should have censorship in our libraries? I say no because if we had censorship then there would be very few good books, magazines, and movies because in this world today everyone gets offended by something. For example in action, horror, and comedy films there could be blood, violence, and cursing, which sometimes make a movie good. Even in some books there is cursing and violence. Some content even seems provocative. For example, in *To Kill a Mockingbird* the book repeatedly uses the n-word. Even some magazines like fashion, sports, and even car magazines are seen as provocative. And if I walked into my local library and saw all my favorite movies, books, and magazines not on the shelf, I would never go back again. I'm not trying to say put adult books in the elementary school library, but in the public library it's okay to have books like that. Could you imagine a library with censorship? It would be empty, and ultimately, such a library would fail to serve its purpose of providing diverse resources to the community.
1697	4674	2	3	Today, we all have a very large variety of books to choose from when we enter a library. Some are childrens books, while others are intended for a more mature reader. Many parents are scared that their child will read a book that might be inappropiate for their child. The thing is, if everyone removes the books that they don't find acceptable, there won't be any books left in the library for us to enjoy. What makes a book unacceptable to read? Could it be language, graphic scenes, or parts that are just extremely scary? Many people think that books like these should not be available for anyone to read. Removing a book from a library would be done through one's opinion. This is not fair because we all have the right to free press, which means that anyone can publish anything they wish to and everyone has the right to read it. By removing books from a library, you are violating not only the author's right, but the reader's as well. Unfourtunately, there are some books that might cause a child to become scared. When a child reads a book, it's harder for them to realize that they are just reading a book. Many children take in every word of a story and turn it into a reality. Not only can this scare a child, but it makes it extremely difficult to explain that what they read in the story is not true. As more and more of these books are released, the more likely it becomes that children will be reading these offensive stories. I believe that removing books from a library based on opinion is wrong. I understand that leaving these types of books out for children to read could cause a problem, but libraries are usually set up in sections. For instance, there is a childrens section, a teen section, and an adult section. This helps kids remain in an area appropiate for their age. I think that if a parent is worried enough that their child will read an offensive book, then they should go with their child to the library when checking out books to read. A public library is designed to accompany a vast variety of readers. There will always be certain books that some of us find offensive. Ultimately, removing books from a library only decreases the number of books to choose from; and if that were to happen, there would eventually be no books left for anyone to enjoy.
1698	4675	2	3	No I do not figure that. I say that there is some material for adults, teens and children. The children aren't going to want to read the adult books and the adults aren't going to wanna read the children's books. The teens aren't going to want to read the children's books, but they might want to read the adult books and that's ok. They will be adults soon; they might be interested. There is nothing wrong with that. If the parents do not want their teens or children reading that kind of material then they should go with them to the library and make them get your approval before checking out the books, magazines, or whatever it is they wanna read at the time. Movies are the same; there are different materials for each age group. Some age groups might be interested in other age groups' material and that's ok, it doesn't mean it's wrong, it just means they're maturing more and are interested or curious. Let them explore; they will figure out for themselves if the material is right for them or not, allowing them to learn and grow as individuals.
1699	4676	2	3	OFFENSIVE BOOKS !!! Did you ever think about why students read what they are reading now? They read books about sex, guns, and many more because they think it's exciting; well, guess what, it's not! The authors who make those types of books want you to buy them because they want their money, but they never think about the kids. Kids will read anything now because of those kinds of things.  I think that books like that should be removed because you don't want your child to grow up reading those types of books, then when they have kids, they wouldn't want the same. Many parents don't care what their children read; as long as they're reading, it's fine with them. It's not fine; it's very wrong, and I wouldn't expect a great writer to use bad language; also, they think it's okay to do that! That's why kids act the way they do now is because of books, movies, etc.  I think they should really stop making those books or have their own stores where adults can go buy those books or whatever books they want. I don't think kids would want to read those types of books anyway because they don't want to learn that stuff, but some of them do, and I don't think that's right at all. That's why kids should read very good books and not judge a book by its cover, ensuring they are exposed to more appropriate and enriching content.
1700	4677	2	3	"Censorship in libraries could have negative effects on the library. Parents have different views on books, music, etc. One parent @MONTH1 may not have a problem with one book that has a few curse words in it, but another parent might think it is not something they want their children to pick up and read, then later on start using that kind of language. But if the libraries censor that book and it is taken out of the library it would make a big impact on people because, what if somebody really likes that book but since someone complained about it, it is now not allowed in the library. The library would lose people because of books being censored. Everybody might not agree on different subjects and they would want a certain book, music, movie or magazine censored. But if one person complained and the book is no longer there, does that mean the libraries are going to be empty for now on? A person who @MONTH1 may not have children might say, ""@CAPS1 one little joke can hurt."" A joke not suitable for a child under @NUM1 to read, hear, or watch. But a parent might get upset that their child is hearing, reading, or even seeing these things and might band it from the library. When a student @MONTH1 needs to go to the library to look up their topic they must research for school and cannot find any or even good books on that topic because someone who thought the book was offensive has been removed from the library. The student might get frustrated and would not know what to do and would have to get most to all of their research off the @CAPS2. What if their teacher/professor said that they needed more than one source and all their information cannot just be off the computer, they need a book, magazine, or newspaper source also. But since that topic they are researching about has upset someone they are not able to find the information they are looking for. Yes, there are some books, music, movies, magazines, and sometimes newspapers that are not for children under @NUM1 or even pre-teens to teens. That is why the libraries are divided into sections for the age groups. Still how do these sections keep our children from reading something inappropriate? Parents should know when they come into a library they should look for signs on the walls; if a library does not have signs that tell them what kind of section they are coming into all they have to do is grab a few books off the shelves and read the inside cover or outside to suggest what kind of books are in the rest of that section. It should not be hard to find these sections because usually the children's section has toys and puzzles in them and children theme walls. Censorship would not only get rid of the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., but it would also make our libraries empty. A lot of people have different point of views, his view might be different from her view. From teens to young adults, teachers to children, parents to non-parents. Everyone is different no one person can speak for the whole world, so allowing open access and diverse perspectives, even when challenging, strengthens the library's role as a community resource; this is why censorship would not work in our libraries."
1701	4678	2	3	A lot of people have huge debates over what they think is appropriate for children and teens to be reading, watching, and listening to; in this topic there will be opinions discussed and logical explanations to what some people think is the proper things kids should be exposed to. First, kids should not be watching rated R movies or even PG-13 if it has vulgar content, sexual content, violence, and etc. Even though some parents allow this, these movies and magazines can still have a huge impact on the child and possibly on how they act in his or her future. Secondly, children still have a good number of movies for them to watch and learn from that can better themselves for their education, career, etc. These movies can teach valuable life lessons and provide positive role models. Finally, teens and young adults exposed to this genre of movies, books, music, or any other media based entertainment are more likely to make destructive decisions than a teenager who doesn't. Although this is not always the case, it does increase the chances of wrong decisions and it does have an influence on the younger minds. In conclusion, young adults, teens, and children should not be able to watch media that contains vulgar content, sexual content, violence, etc, without parent supervision and permission, as it can potentially lead to negative consequences.
1702	4679	2	3	In libraries there should be a control over what certain kind of books, magazines, or movies that children should be able to read. For instance movies, are we going to go let a 7 year watch a rated R movie much less let him/her watch a porn movie. No thats just plain wrong. That goes with magazines and books. Magazines have some images that aren't appropriate for the right age bracket that can easily pick it up and look at it. Books as well kids have very imaginative minds, they may not have pictures in them but still kids know a little more than what we give them credit for.  Me, I would know this because as a little kid my brothers got a rated R film called 'Chucky's Bride'. After watching all 4 of the films that were available at the time, I just could not look at a doll the same way again. Whenever my mom would get rid of a doll she used to own some of them had eyes that would move. I always sat at one side of the car while the doll would be as far away from me aas possible.  To prevent other kids from experiencing what I did local libraries ought to create sections in the library where you've got your children section, the teen section, and the adult section. So then you can easily tell the kids to only go to either the teen section or the kids section. This should be the way to organize the films and magazines as well. I know some people wouldnt agree with my ideas but I have to ask them in return. Do you have any better ideas?  Now for getting rid of stuff in our library that can be offensive. I would say we keep it, our kids need to know our culture that way they can survive in it. They need to know that there are still racists out there even though society tries to cover it up. There's no way there going to be able to keep other people's opinions from coming ears length of the head. If our children are to grow up maturley they need to experience or at least know what bullying is. Maybe learn what an athiest is or find out on their own what a sexist is. Some of it is inappropriat'e so i will agree that kids need to find this out at a certain age but you can't keep it out of their lives forever. Thats why its best not to throw the books out that mention those sort of things; keeping these resources available, while implementing age-appropriate access controls, offers a balanced approach to protecting children while preparing them for the complexities of the world.
1703	4680	2	3	Censorship in Libraries Have you ever came across something in the library that makes you say, 'That's inappropriate!' If so, I am sure your not alone. Just the other day I was in the library. There were posters up all around featuring a new movie now avalible for rental. I remembered seeing ads for this particular movie on television that looked rather repulsive. How could they allow this kind of thing on display like this? How does this affect the minds of our country's youth? My thought on this topic is clear, although I am sure I'd recieve some opposition from others, considering everyone has their own opinions on this matter. I do realize the library has age limits on rentals, but what about all these posters everywhere? You don't necessarily have to rent the material to be corrupted by it. I believe there should be a separate section for this kind of material. Another example of library rentals that can be harmful to developing minds are CDs. New music sometimes contains lewd or inappropriate lyrics that have no place in the library. Even the covers of some CDs should be removed for the good of the public. It's interesting how these things just slide by the library. I once saw a young by renting a DVD that had the words 'parental advisory' right on the cover! No one stopped him. Books are the same way. Disturbing covers and titles are littered throughout the library. No one even cares to screen these books before they hit the shelves. So, when do you think someone's going to do something about censorship in libraries? It is hard to say, but I strongly believe it's up to protesters like us to stop this. I hope you'll join me in this epic battle for censorship, to keep our youth safe, because their protection is our responsibility.
1704	4681	2	3	I personally do not think that books or magazines and such with offensive things about them shouldn't be removed because they give people something to read. Most people don't want to read classics or a novel. Some people want to read about crimes, mysterys, and action. There are alot of good movies out there but some of them I can agree with are too offensive to others. I gurantee that movies with comedy in them will be put down about what is being said. For example: Dumb and Dumber or South Park to some people is very offensive. The only reason the person would think that the movie is offensive is because they are stubborn people that don't have a life. I can believe that there are literature materials that are offensive to others, but the person that criticizes others doesn't think that they are offensive to the people that read the books that offened the person that is being offended. Books about war to some people are too graffic. But those books about war are probably books about history. I have only started noticing the people that are trying to get rid of those books that they don't like. But back in the 1960's people didn't care about what was in a library. They just want something to read. I say leave the librarys alone! It is important to respect diverse reading preferences and maintain access to a wide range of materials, even if some find them offensive.
1705	4682	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a great issue in the world today. Many authors now use offensive methods and terms to persuade their audiences. However, many do not. All authors have the right to say what they wish but there is a limit to where the books should be placed and who should view them. If libraries accept offensive types of magazines, books, music, movies, etc., they should most certainly be placed out of the reach of children. Like many libraries in the city, there is a section for children and a sperate section for adults. Any materials that are found offensive should be placed in a special section of the adult area and customers should be warned in some way, perhaps with a clear label or a note in the catalog. Since everyone has their own view of what is right and what is wrong, a special team should be placed in charge of keeping the offensive materials seperate. Those who borrow anything at the library @MONTH1 have the right to bring that special book or movie to the attention of those in charge. By sticking to this method, offensive materials can stay out of the hands of those who do not wish to see them. Items containing vulgar language is unjust to most. There are still the majority, however, who engage in the oppertunity to view these materials. Everyone does have the right to do what they wish but, from personal experience and growing up in a home where I was taught right from wrong, people should be treated with dignity as well as respect. No matter our color, size, looks, or personalities, we are all created equally as our constitution says. Therefore, we should only view what would be considered just to all. After all, everyone wishes to be treated kindly, right? It is through such careful management and respect for differing viewpoints that libraries can serve their communities effectively.
1706	4683	2	3	Public libraries should be able to keep all sorts of content for all sorts of people. I feel very strongly about my statement, because everyone in this world is different. Many people have different interests, religions, and customs. If we took out certain books and music from the library, it would defeat the purpose of calling it the public library, which is designed to serve the entire community. Instead, if we had different sections of books, music, etc., people would be able to find what they want/need more easily, and no one would have to worry about getting offended by materials they didn't choose to engage with. It would not be fair to anyone in this world if we took out certain books and materials simply because one person had got offended, as libraries are meant to be inclusive spaces offering diverse perspectives for all.
1707	4684	2	3	People in this common era have different approaches to the idea of libraries. Some view the library as a place to go and learn and to express yourself and be free. Others believe it to be a place where there is danger for minors and can be very inappropriate. These two opinions can cause an intriguing argument. People go to the library because they want to either get away, or just to be free and grab a nice book. There are many books to choose from, but you need to be careful while browsing. Some books, although good, can be inappropriate to some ages, and that's when controversy spills. Parents think the library is encouraging the check-out of inappropriate books, but this isn't all that true. It's all about the placement of books, and that's what most librarians will tell you. They didn't encourage the kid to check it out, but they have every right to. It is also unknown that what is offensive to one person, might bring joy to another person maybe of a different race or ethnic background. I think that these so-called offensive books or magazines that parents complain about, should not be removed from libraries. There is a reason those books are there and they are not put up there to be offensive; so why take them down? I think a way we can monitor these kids to stay away from books their parents believe can be harmful to them is by making a rule stating that a child must be present with an adult in certain sections. This will not only stop the fact that kids checkout books much inappropriate for them, but it might also make the parents stop complaining and the controversy will end. People need to stop looking at the library as a place that brings negativity, but as a place for giving children joy. Remember, it was built for those who enjoy reading and so people can have a place to do so. Why complain? Find the positives in what it brings instead of looking down on it. Bring back the feelings of what the library brought to you when you were a child, and let's work to maintain the library as a resource for everyone, young and old, to explore the world through reading.
1708	4685	2	3	Most modern day book, movies, music, etc. do a fairly good job of placing warning in the form of 'EXPLICIT CONTENT' stickers on their covers. But books from before this practice began to happen may be found more offensive then books today. Why? Well, that's because many books of the past use words that today are found offensive. But those books, movies, and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem. There are examples of how each catagory is in today's society. Take the book 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn', written by Mark Twain, for example. In that story, there are words that are used to describe people of that time. Back when Mark Twain wrote the book, it was perfectly fine to use those words on those people, but in today's modern world, that is a book that has been on the list for being banned. It is offensive to use that word on people today, so parent groups and others are trying to get that book pulled off of shelves in hopes of erasing what was done in the past. I don't believe that a book should be banned for it's content, but rather how well it teaches its reader through its words. If it can teach a student in a high school or college class about the history and the culture of that time, then it shouldn't be banned at all. It should be read. Movies have a rating system for a reason. There are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience. People must be of a certain age to rent, buy, or view these kind of movies 'leagally'. Not too many people listen to that system, even though it has exsisted for years. A horror film is not suitable for a child of a young age who believes everything he or she sees on TV. Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives a child nightmares or makes them not as emotionally aware of what is right or wrong. That is the fault of the parents. They were the ones who let their child watch that movie in the first place. So the movie shouldn't be held responsible for the child. If the movie was intended for a more mature audience, that's the way it should stay. And that brings us to music. There is a lot of music in today's age that can be considered very offensive. There are only a few 'pure' genres, free of the cursing that is used in many of the others today. But children, teen, and adults all find their favorite kind, and you can't change their minds then. The governement has issued that all music containing harsh words, horrid images to the mind, gruesome scenes, and other elements that are offensive to people, must carry a sticker on it. The black and white 'EXPLICIT CONTENT' sticker. When parents see this sticker on the CD, MP3 download, or whatever their child is using, then they know that it is more than likely not right for their child to listen to. Doesn't mean that the parent is actually going to listen all the time, but it means that there is a slight chance that their minds will not be tainted by 'garbage'. So, in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't neccessarily mean that it is the same to another person. There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep children from seeing them and to help with the level of harshness that is given to today's society. People will still argue that books such as 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn', 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer', 'Catcher in the Rye', and many, many more books like them should be banned. They will always fight that movies such as 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', 'Friday the 13th', or 'Child's Play' should be removed from store shelves because it gave them nightmares as a kid or it gives their child nightmares because they saw it. And they will always try to fight and say that artist like Eminem's music, Slipknot, and Marilyn Manson are not suited for their child. Well, this pattern has been going on for years. Those books were made many years before, those movies are intended for a adult audience, not for a child of a young age, and those artists are just trying to make money like everyone else. So when parents try to argue about what should be on shelves and what should not, remember that it might be that parent's fault for letting their child view it in the first place.
1709	4686	2	3	"What do you want your children to be able to see in their public library? As we all know, there are things like books, pictures, and movies that we do not want our younger generation to see. This is why PARENTS are so careful with computers, and what their children have access to. Every situation has its pros and cons, but in MANY cases if you analyze the pros and cons you can come to an accurate conclusion. When you go to a library with your children, the children run off to do what they want, usually to the children's section. Let's face it, children do not want to look at adult books. Once children learn to read you might come across a bigger problem. As children get older they want to be able to do more things, like watching older movies, reading harder books, and look at what they want on the computer.  I'm sure that the first thing that might come to mind is to censor the library, take away the horror films, the banned books etcetera. This might be fine at first, but what about the adults that have every right to read and watch whatever they want. The library is free, does this mean that if our society does not like a book, movie, or magazine that the adults must go somewhere else to pay for a particular book or movie as opposed to borrowing if for free at the public library. It could work, but if a child is going to look at bad things at a library what will stop him/her from looking at them at a bookstore?  Another issue is banned books. MANY of them are classics that past generations have read in school. WHY would we decide to take these books away now? It makes it seem like the younger generations cannot handle it, or that past generations have something to hide. The definition of a classic is a piece of writing that has stood the test of time. Does it just end here and now? WHY would we take the classics away? Let's face it, if the classics are not read in school today, and they are not read in the next generations what is stopping them from being forgotten? Some banned books parents will look at and say, ""WHY would this be banned? I do not remember anything bad in it."" MANY of the time the classic banned books were written some time in the PAST, GENERALLY SPEAKING, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE NINETEENTH CENTURY or the EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY. Society was different then. When you read a classic it acts as a history book to show us how it was to live during the time it was written. Usually the book will be banned because of bad language which people think should be taken out of our schools, but they are missing the point. That was how things were back then so, who are we to hide it?  Does this mean that I think anything and everything should be put in our public libraries? Not at all. Some magazines can be avoided, or be put in a section away from younger children's eyes. Horror movies do not have to be taken out completely, just put in a different section. If parents are worried about monitoring their children on the internet there is nothing stopping them from watching their children while they are using a computer.  I think that there can be some censorship in libraries, but sometimes our society goes overboard. As long as we keep an open mind and make the right decisions for our future generations we can make our country a safe yet educational place to learn, ensuring that libraries remain valuable resources for all."
1710	4687	2	3	Have you ever read something that you have found offensive, upsetting, or has made you mad? Do you think that there are certian books that shouldn't be allowed in a library because of its content? A lot of books, music, movies, and magazines these days contain things that are hurtful to society or protray bad images of certian social groups. In @DATE1's society there are many different groups of people and a lot of them have thier own opinions on how they view different things. To me, when I think about a library, I think about how all different ages of people go to them, how there are many different groups of people there, and about the types of books that are in there. Taking this all into concideration, I believe that everything should be allowed in public libraries but I do think that there should be seperate places for books, magazines, and movies that should be only for adults. I think this because if you take away all the things that are 'bad' or 'offensive' to you, you could be displeasing those who find these things interesting or enjoy reading them. In this case, people would not come to the library anymore because they cannot read what they enjoy reading or find interesting.  By saying these things, seperating the books into age groups is a good thing because then the younger children who are running around the library will not pick up something that they should not be looking at. I also believe that is would benefit them because then if someone comes into the library looking for a book but does not really know what to do and they go to where their age group would be; then they can see everything that is recommended for them.  From my own experience, I know that I have read some books and looked at some magazines that I probably should not have looked at because I was too young. This does not mean that they need to take them off the shelves but maybe that they should be placed in an area where someone my age will not be able to find them. So the next time you go to the library and see something that is offensive to you, just remember that there are a lot of different people in this world who might find what you think is offensive, interesting. Therefore, libraries should strive to balance freedom of access with responsible curation, ensuring that all viewpoints are represented while also protecting younger patrons from potentially harmful content through age-appropriate segregation.
1711	4688	2	3	Yes, there are a lot of books out there that have graphic and sexual phrases, and there are a lot of concerned parents out there who are worried about what the libraries are possibly letting their kids read. One good idea would be to put age limit signs in certain areas of the libraries, though that doesn't necessarily mean that the kid is going to listen to that sign. We all know for a fact that pornography will stay away from libraries and stay where they are at right now, so that's not an issue the parents should worry about. I think the libraries should be broken into sections: a kid section, a teen section, and an adult section, but I don't think that the adult section should be too far off the teen section because when we say adult books or magazines everybody expects it to be one thing, porn. It should still be some type of book with some kind of censorship to it. There should be doors blocking each entrance to each section of books, and to get to them you have to show the librarian some proof of age to be able to get into those sections, except the kid section. The kid section is a section that all kids can use, because we know that that section of books would be harmless to kids. I think that with that kind of security it would allow parents to be less stressed and worried for their child's safety and insecurity of the mind. There are tons of other ideas to explore to be able to try and keep books with some kind of censorship but most of them are off the wall and ridiculous. I think that music and movies shouldn't even be in libraries, just leave those to other stores; it's better to let stores deal with that than libraries. The librarian probably doesn't even know half the CDs that probably get checked out anyways, so it's best if you don't have those in there at all. Give some thought to these ideas that I just sprung at you. I personally think that having doors blocking access to certain books would be a great plan to use, because it would block access to these areas from certain kids. Some other parents or people might have ideas of their own and it would be great to hear them or have some kind of bulletin about them around the city or town, as more open discussion can help create a more secure library environment for children.
1712	4689	2	3	Look it's a plane, it's a bird, it's a...harmful word. There has been many times when i have read a passage wether it be a magazine article, a book or a newspaper and I have come across harmful words. They @MONTH1 not all mean harm towards me but towards other readers they could. People have their own opinnions on different views, so a word or passage could effect me differently then say smeone else. I don't think it's the materials I think it's the readers maturity level that makes a difference. That is how harmful words get changed into names and then the next thing peers are calling other peers that word. For instnce the word 'wetback' in biography book about the @CAPS1 it is okay to be there, it is when the reader inturperates it the wrong way, and they think it is funny, and cool to go around and call someone that word, especially a person of that race. That is when I dont think materials like this should be on shelves, but then again it goes back to the maturity level. These words or passages can become harmful to someone that hasn't even read it, but because someone that has took the iniciative to start calling someone that word, or relating that passage to them. Books can, and are a great reliable source for schoolers that are researching for class projects, i think it's the certain topics of books that's get these words turned into harm. Books about certain races can cause name calling among a school just because they read it in a book and think it is okay, because the book described a person that way doesn't mean it's okay for the reader to start calling people by that word. Other topics like 'sex' in a book can be inturperated in the wrong way as well. Some teens think it's okay just because the characters in the book are doing it then it's okay for them and their significant other to try it. Either way with the book left on the shelf or taken off it is still going to be a problem with name calling. So it's going to take something else then a materials being removed from a shelf to find a solution to this problem. They might come across the word in January, but the impact could vary greatly. The AMERICAN_PRESIDENCY example shows it's about understanding context, not just avoiding words. Ultimately, we need to focus on fostering understanding and critical thinking, as censorship alone won't solve the problem of harmful language.
1713	4690	2	3	Censorship is a very large thing to talk about. Some people think that a book has too much talking about sex in it, while others think that it is sutable for the public. Sometimes people want other people to make the decitions on what they read. People need to decide what they do and don't want to read and see. Firstly, people think that other people are incable of deciding for them selves what they want to read. They blocked books because they thought that it would show a side of things to children that they did not want them to see. The Harry Potter books were block because they had witchcraft and they were scared that people were going to start trying to do it. Grapes of Wrath was banded because their was slavery in it. Even though slavery was a big thing they still did not want any of the younger people to have it. Secondly, some music and movies should be banned. Music has become a way for people to express them selves. Latily they have gotten to the point that drugs and 'hos' are alright to talk about. One song that I just saw was called WAP. Now if that is not sending a bad message than I don't know was is a good message. Movies are in the same boat as music. They are showing the violence that people only have in their head. My Bloody Valentine was a movie that off the top of my head was showing a minner that had gone completly blood thursty and was killing any one that went in his cave, just because he could. Although, somethings we need to see the things that people have in minds heads. I know that I am going to be more carful when I am out. In conclution, censorship is no real yes or no anser. Censorship is always exceptions to whatever people say. This is why people need to decide what they do and don't watch and read, since there is no clear right or wrong answer when dealing with the complex issue of censorship.
1714	4691	2	3	What race are you? What religion are you? What have you been taught? Almost anything like these could be considered offensive. So should these types of things be taken out of libraries? No, these types of things are everywhere. You just can't get away from them. Today you can find so many offensive television shows and commercials. For example the commercials for @CAPS1 chewing gum with that @CAPS2 attractive woman, some people might consider that offensive. You might ask, 'how could that be offensive?', well there might be a person who has a disease who can't get that 'clean feeling' and always has bad breath. That person might take offense to these commercials. Another example might be television shows, like @ORGANIZATION1 Comedy Central. Some @CAPS4 African Americans and just other races get offended by these types of things. Does that really mean we should get rid of them though? People everywhere are somehow offended by something, the world isn't perfect. Even if we did take out these types of offensive material in libraries, it could still be seen. So whats the point? If you tried to take it all out, like everywhere in the world everything would be crazy. There is no such thing as a perfect world, I believe if there was people would go crazy. For example in the movie '@CAPS5 The @CAPS6 Giver,' the main character finds a town that is suppose to resemble 'The @CAPS7 Perfect @CAPS8 Society' or a perfect society. In the town at first everything is nice, but then everyone is so perfect that he can't stand it and leaves. The best thing to do is let these materials stick around because there is nothing you can do to get them gone from everywhere else. Also they help kids learn, if you keep them locked up and not knowing anything, then how far are they going to get in life? So should these things go away or not? I think that these materials, while potentially offensive to some, shouldn't be removed from libraries or other places because complete removal is impossible and they can offer learning opportunities.
1715	4692	2	3	Is there a song that your parents wouldn't let you listen to when you were a child? When you sang this song did they yell at you and ground you because they had told you many times before that you weren't allowed to listen to it? How about a movie that you wanted to go watch because it was what everyone was talking about but it was rated R so you weren't allowed to watch it. That book on that shelf that you accidentally ran into while doing a research project, containing inappropriate language and terms. There is much media and books that are out there that parents wouldn't want their children to read. But overall there is the government who censors things going on around the world. Censoring can have good and bad qualities. In my experience I've noticed that people that know less tend to be more happy than people who know more. But if you are able to read and or watch these censored materials you would see the idea from a certain point of view, and maybe agree with the person. Most news is about things that are bad, rarely any good news comes around. For example if something were to happen in Brazil, where thousands of people were being used to test if lions liked to eat humans, the government would censor the news to the people in their country due to any reason. If there was movie that was made that was racist against Asian people the government would probably censor it. Things that look bad tend to be censored. I've noticed that people who read censored material feel special because they read or saw something that wasn't supposed to be known by the rest of the population. A lot more freedom of speech would occur if censored material wasn't censored. People also tend to become mad when they find out that material is being censored because they feel like something is being hidden for them, could be valuable information. In reading I have noticed that societies that practice censorship tend to have angry citizens. But in the other hand if they believe that it's for the good of the society then they accept the fact that it's not good for them. People also want to be given the right to make their own decisions. In a censored civilization they have no idea what is going on outside their borders and are usually clueless or being lied to by their government. Censorship can have good and bad qualities. People tend to be offended when material is censored, but it's probably for the best for them. Hidden information could be good and bad but mostly bad, most people want to know the truth rather than a lie. Censorship is just bad in general, people should have the right to make their own decisions on what they want to read or watch, even if those decisions lead them to uncomfortable truths.
1716	4693	2	3	I somewhat agree with taking out books, music, movies, magazines, or any other material that could be offensive to someone, because it could be racial or it could be about something that isn't appropriate for children to read. I think it just depends on the topic; maybe one thing could be offensive to one person and not the other, so people should choose wisely what they read. It wouldn't be fair to take certain books from the shelves of libraries because people take different interests in different topics, so say one book has something in it that someone doesn't think is appropriate, but another person thinks that book is fine; it wouldn't be fair to the other person to take that book from the shelves. But something that I do disagree with in books or magazines that is inappropriate is pictures and comics, because children shouldn't be allowed to have access to a book, movie, or a magazine that has that type of content in it. But also I think that parents or an adult should look at the criteria first before they allow a child to read or see it, offering guidance. So it depends on what type of things are in the book, movie, or magazine. Basically it's up to the person; if they don't like the criteria in any of those things, then they shouldn't look into it, acknowledging that individual discretion and parental oversight both play key roles.
1717	4694	2	3	I don't think materials should be removed from library shelves simply because someone dislikes or disagrees with the topic or plot. Banning a book from a public library based solely on someone's negative opinion about its message is not a good idea. As you mentioned, people have the choice to not engage with content they find offensive. Katherine Paterson's quote highlights the danger of allowing subjective removal, stating that if everyone had the right to remove books they abhor, there would be very few books left for anyone. Personal taste varies greatly. Your experience of finding a book enjoyable after a friend disliked it illustrates this point. Therefore, people should not be able to remove books based on their personal preferences, because a wide variety of perspectives and reading material should be available to everyone.
1718	4695	2	3	"I have been to the library and while looking for a book I have come across books about slavery with strong language or teenage years which included alcohol, drugs, and sexual content. In the library, you can find books for leisure, study, training, and books found offensive to a variety of people. People from children whose parents would be appalled by what their kids are reading about to adults find books offensive. Although there are things in the library that are found offensive, I believe that books, movies, magazines, and music with offensive things in them should stay on the shelves because the internet is no different then the offensive things in a library, most people don't mind the vulgar and violence within the pages, and there are some fantastic books that some might find offensive.  People for centuries have been writing and coming up with songs, movies, and magazines. What was accepted 'back then' is now considered inappropriate for viewers and readers. There are many things in a library that, if not careful, could corrupt children. Children reading about violence, drugs, and other no no's are what teaches them wrong. Parents and other people have been concerned about the censorship of libraries. Hard enough as it is, parenting doesn't need the help of books, movies, and music to influence the bad onto children. Children are the future and they need to be taught the right way.  An old librarian once told me that books need to be cherished throughout the years because they will eventually be replaced with technology and all the books, good or bad, will be gone. It's hard to even imagine how technology is replacing various things in our lives and how it has changed from when it first started to be popular. How does this pertain to offensive books? Like almost everything out there, the internet could be used for good, or for harm. Parents are concerned about their children reading books that are bad but let their child surf the internet which is hard telling how many inappropriate sites he/she might go to accidentally, or on purpose. Books, music, and other offensive stuff in libraries are minor compared to the internet. Protecting children from adult content filled libraries should be the least of a parent's concerns. Even if they are concerned about the minds of their children when they go inside a library, they can filter what a child looks at and reads about. The internet is the real bad guy if anything is going to be blamed for corruption of minds.  Many people throughout the world have different tastes of what they like in a book. A good plotline, good dialogue, interesting theme, drama, language, violence, drugs, alcohol, and sex are all ways people find reading books enjoyable. Their own opinion on what is interesting is what helps them decide on books to read. Reading books is a passion to some and enjoyable books is a must for them. Without offensive books, people would find reading boring, and wouldn't be as popular as it has been. I don't know about you, but I enjoy books that aren't boring. Most offensive books are not boring and the action is what gets my attention and keeps me reading.  There are great books that for years people have enjoyed reading and continue to read today. Even though they are offensive, they provide good details that are required for a good book. Tom Clancy and Stephen King are famous for writing gory, violent, gruesome books that would be qualified as offensive to others. You have the choice not to read them or to read them. Books that deal with slavery in January also be found offensive like the book ""Uncle Tom's Cabin."" It does a superb job at describing how things were during slave times.  Books, music, magazines, and movies should not be removed from the bookshelves because they are essential to everyday people and reading, and they are required by some to enjoy a good book and to fully understand different perspectives and historical contexts, even if those perspectives contain elements that some may find offensive."
1719	4696	2	3	Hi, my name is mason and i'm writing about wether we should take books off the self and etc. People have differnt views on differnt things. Books, books give a differnt form of lerning to differnt people.I personal don't learn from books as well as I do from the internet or tv but books are nice to have every once in a great while. Eeryone like to sit down and read a good book every once in a while. Music doesn't really teach you anything, it relaxs you in differnt ways. Some people might learn from listening to music but i'm not one of those peole. It influnce you to get movited, say your getting ready for a football game and you want to get hyped up for it, well some music can get you hyped up for that game. When i sit down and watch a movie I can learn from it cause i have the patien to sit down and watch it, to learn from it but that is just me other people have differnt ways of learning but the best way for me is to watch movies. They get stright to the point and don't waste time telling you stuff you alredy know. Magazines are helpful to they have short artcicles that get stright to the point too, and that is what I like about magazines and movies. Even though there are very few magazines that give out helpful information, the ones that do help out alot. So I think that music should be taken off shelves because they don't really teach you alot but books, movies, and magazine do help you to a certian point. It is up the other people to decide wether music should be taken off the shelves not just one person cause music might help other people in differnt ways not just one way but many ways too, so the decision requires more consideration than just my viewpoint.
1720	4697	2	3	I am a student from @CAPS1. I wanted to let you know that there have been some great and interesting books that I have read from the schools library and the public library as well. The only problem is that there have been some complaints from my friends and families about the books. Not only that but I've also seen books that are not appropriate for children to be reading. I just wanted to let you know this because I was kind of thinking that taking books out wouldn't be a good idea for them to do. I think so because without books less people would want to read and not learn. To begin with, I wanted to talk about the complaints that friends have told me. One of them was that at the school there had not been good books to read and that they want to take most of them out and replace them with the ones they like. I was thinking that if they did that they would be the only ones to go to the library because it is only there choice and not everyones. So what I'm trying to say is that if we don't have good books students won't be going to the library. If they don't get books then they won't do well in school which is something that will affect the school. This would mean that the library’s resources would be underutilized and students may miss out on crucial learning opportunities. Furthermore about the complaints was that one of my own family member had seen a young girl looking at a book that was not appropriate for her at the public library. So instead of taking those types of books out they should be put into a room that is strictly not for children to go in. They should do that because if it were to be taken out then that book wouldn't ever be used again. Also another reason is that If they were to be taken out, then another peson might need information over the topic of the book and wouldn't be able to find it because it isn't there. That is why I thing those types of books should be in a special room intead of them being taken out. This way, access is controlled while still allowing the book to be available for research or older readers. Finally, as I had somewhat mentioned earlier is that books are truly important. That is why I go against taking books out that are not favored by others. If a person doesn't like a certain book/ magazine then they should just request the book/ magazine that they want to read. By doing that then the book that arn't being used could actually be used by someone else that is intersted in it. So if we keep all our book, then more students and people would go and read. This promotes a more diverse collection and caters to a wider range of interests. In conclusion, people might say that taking out book is better than keeping them. Well in the way I see it, they are wrong because keeping them is better. It is better because someday those books can be useful nomatter how old they are. If they were inappropriate books like metioned earlier, they should be put away in a good place. If there arn't enough interesing ones then requesting one is another way to do it. That is why I think that taking out books from the shelves is wrong and they should do watever in order to not let books go to waist.
1721	4698	2	3	There are things in this world that are relative. Censorship is one of them. Relative means that one person has a different view than that of another. Censorship is when a person or organization in authority does not allow people to see things that they believe are inappropriate. One phrase that is very important to censorship is 'things that they believe.' WHAT is inappropriate to one person could be deemed viewable to another. This should not be decided by one person or even one group that believes they know WHAT is socially acceptable or politically correct. Censorship in libraries are not a good thing. JOHN and JANE walk into a library, and there is a magazine on the rack that depicts a person standing over a two hundred pound, twenty four point, state record, whitetail deer with with a gun in their hand. JOHN is a firm believer in providing for his family and the rights given to an individual in the second ammendment of the UNITED STATES constitution. Even if that means killing an animal for its resources. For some there is pride in harvesting an animal and knowing that they provided that meat. JOHN will see the magazine as an opportunity. He might learn tips from the magazine, or find some new gear that he thinks could be useful. JANE on the other hand is a conservative. She believes killing is wrong and inhumane. She goes to the store and buys her meat from the freezer section. JANE prefers not to know where her meat came from. She will view this magazine as inappropriate. Again, censorship is relative to the person looking over the material. Does that mean that just because JANE thinks the magazine is inappropriate, it should be taken off of the shelf so that someone like JOHN can not read it, appreciate it, and gain knowledge from it? That choice is up to JANE not to read the magazine, not to the librarian. JANE is responsible for her own views and choices. She is entitled to them. JOHN is entitled as well. Leave the choice to the reader. Over in the book section there are BOB and BILL. BOB is a fanatic for science and history. BILL has a preference for religious books that explain the theology behind some of the things the world says and things of his religion. At the end of the row, on top of the shelf sits a book on the topic of evolution. BOB belives this theory and sees the book as interesting. BILL looks at the book and thinks to himself, 'That stuff is not true. Why would anyone waste their time reading it.' Does that mean that the book should be taken off the shelf because BILL will not read it. BILL should just walk away from it. If he chooses not to, that is up to BILL. Leave that choice to BILL. Up at the desk there are the librarians. They have their views and opinions and are entitled to them as well. But the books, music, movies, and magazines that are displayed for checking out should not be chosen because he or she likes them or opposes them, but because someone might be looking for the information in that material. If the choice is left to them that material might not be available to the reader that needs it. Censorship is a terrible thing for libraries. It takes material away from people that can be useful. Censorship, along with many other things is relative. WHAT one person MAY deem inappropriate could be viewed as totally fine with another person. Based on moral values, character, and opinions developed with progression of life, people have made judgements on WHAT is appropriate or unacceptable. That choice to look at that magazine, read that book, or listen to that song should be left up to them, not made for them.
1722	4699	2	3	"It has occurred to me that some materials available at libraries are not suitable for young children. Libraries sometimes contain materials that are not age-appropriate or are offensive. Not all books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive or condone harmful things, but some expose children to content they are too young to understand. Much of today's music contains inappropriate content like sex, drugs, and violence. Last fall, I found a movie in my school library that I felt was inappropriate without parental verification. Exposure to sex and drugs can normalize these behaviors for young teens and children. Often, teens who engage in inappropriate behavior claim they ""heard it in a movie."" Public libraries often have movies, books, music, and other items that aren't appropriate for young children. While librarians are busy and can't monitor the entire library, they can secure inappropriate materials. Children often choose books that look interesting and fun. Today's books sometimes have guns, drugs, and sexual content on the cover, making them appealing to children. In school libraries, books are usually age-appropriate, but public libraries cater to both children and adults. Certain books should be restricted, and age ratings should be enforced. Therefore, libraries need to monitor what is being checked out, regardless of who is borrowing it, and I.D.s should be requested when necessary to ensure that young people are not accessing material that is too mature for them."
1723	4700	2	3	All things in the world are not strictly black and white. Every person is different, with varying ideas. So when some people are certain that a specific word or topic should be restricted, there will always be another person to say the exact opposite. Sometimes, what's found as 'vulgar' can only be introduced with the intent of education. Also, this ties in with something our country was founded on, which is freedom of the speech, and the press. Magazines, music, books and movies are mainly for entertainment. Everyone who reads or watches something will take it in differently, and it will have a varying effect. Let's say there is a @NUM1-year-old girl who just had her first day of high school. While at lunch, she slipped and dropped her tray of food. Later that day while she's alone reading her favorite magazine, she's reading an article about embarrassing stories, where one girl accidentally walked into a boys' restroom. Some parents @MONTH1 deem this inappropriate, but it has made the young girl feel better about her situation. It can offer a sense of normalcy.  It's human to mess up and act crazy; we aren't perfect by nature. So when we see errors made into comedies and dramas by any form of media, it's human to realize that we aren't the only ones who undergo these events. To censor books and televisions would be like claiming nothing bad happens. Not to say that a novel written about brutal murder that contains sexual references should be given to a little kid, but it should not be pulled from the shelf all together. There must be discretion, as well as access.  The topic of censorship in schools is also a very sensitive one, especially with younger kids. As Katherine Paterson pointed out, if every parent had the right to remove a book that they thought was not suitable, then eventually there would be nothing left. Many parents are uneasy with the thought of their child being taught things like sexual education, but on the other hand, there are also the parents who appreciate it. They do so not because it saves them time, but because certain explicit topics - to an extent - can help someone mature if it's done in a controlled environment. They believe it can foster open communication.  Years ago, it was not uncommon to see censorship in the media. It could range from saying 'intercourse' to replace 'sex' or it could be something like extreme propoganda. There's a reason that our consitution protects freedom of speech. No matter how appauling someone @MONTH1 find a topic, it usually has some type of informative purpose. Otherwise, it probably wouldn't have gotten issued. It's meant to spark discussion.  Choosing what is and isn't offensive is a matter of opinion. As previously stated, no two humans are exactly the same, and their opinions won't be either. So this means that if one person out of a group is allowed to dispose of or censor whatever they find necessary, it must be recognized that some portion of the remaining people will be unsatisfied. This is usually where people will claim that the law protects their freedom of speech. In the end, the media is largely for entertainment. It provides numerous shows and articles, with a huge array of topics. This goes to show that if one should find something offensive, it doesn't mean they have to rip it off the shelves and complain; it simply means they have the opportunity look elsewhere. In a world of such diverse viewpoints, tolerance and choice are ultimately the most reasonable solution.
1724	4701	2	3	There are many perspectives on censorship in our country. That's just how our country is; we have different opinions on everything we do. But we have to live with it. There are many different perspectives that come from old, young, parents, and children. In libraries, there are some books, music, etc. that might be offensive to people. But we all have different opinions; therefore, we can never listen to one person, or it would start a fight between people that disagree with him/her. I think people that go into the library should be mature about what goes on in there; otherwise, they shouldn't be in there looking at whatever they are wanting to read about. The library is opened for the public and has lots of knowledge it shares with us, but if we get rid of all the censorship, then it denies people knowledge. The books that they would get rid of would be because of the children. Because parents don't want children to look at adult material that is not appropriate for them, so they try to keep it hidden. I think we should keep censorship around because it would deny knowledge to people if we did not keep it. And we should remind parents that some things in the library are not suitable for children's eyes and let them be responsible for what their children look at, ensuring that access to information is balanced with parental guidance and community standards.
1725	4702	2	3	I do not think that a random stranger should have the right to decide what books to allow in a public library. If they have a problem with certain material in certain books they should bring it to the attention of the library. The author who wrote that book has the freedom of speech, and they are allowed to write anything that they would like to write. If somebody did not want their children looking at a book, or reading that book, then they should just tell their child to stay away from it, and if they raised their child properly, he or she should respect those boundaries that the parents have set. However, I think there should be a line drawn about what is too graphic to be displayed at a public library. Some magazines that contain graphic material are very educational, such as National Geographic. On the other hand, I am not saying that we should be lining shelves with Hustler magazines either. There is a difference between having books that educate children about other cultures, and those that educate them about sex and explicit material. It is the adults job to protect their children from material such as that, but they can do it in another way, other than taking the book off the shelf. Even if the book is filled with drugs or nudity, the concerned parent cannot just take actions into their own hands. The owner of the library is the adult that gets to decide what types of books or magazines he or she allows in the library, not the customers. I think that if you are offended by a certain book at a library, you should bring it to the attention of the owner, or simply go to a different library. If the owner refuses to remove the item from the shelf and the material offends you that much, you could go to court and plead your case to the judge, but you have no right to remove a book from a shelf that does not belong to you, as such actions undermine the established procedures for managing library resources.
1726	4703	2	3	When picking a book, music, movie, and magazines from the library it's always a hard decision because you may be like me and want to read more than one book at a time. Books that are found offensive are more interesting than just plain boring books. So why would anybody take books off the shelf for being offensive? After all, different people have different tastes and interests. When children pick books from the library you want to make sure their kids books and you also want to check to see if their educational. You definitely wouldn't want a little kid getting ahold of an adult book or a book that is found offensive in some way. So have an adult section and a kids section. This ensures age-appropriate content is available. When we walk into a library full of books, theirs a huge variety of any kind of books. We would lower the use of going to the library if books were taken off the shelves because their wouldn't be any use of going. If your not going to find a book there, why go to the library anymore? Libraries are supposed to offer a wide range of materials. The last reason to not take books off the shelves is people that can not afford to buy a book from anywhere obviously come to the library to borrow a book. So taking books away would just limit their learning and would not be very benificial to them. Access to diverse reading material is important for those with limited resources. The only reason that I would find it okay to take offensive books and anything else off shelves is for childrens sake and safety. If the library's are thinking about taking offensive books off shelves, they should have a public vote to see what everyone else thinks about it. If they decide to take books off the shelves, why not just have an adult section in the library? Anybody that is 18 years of age or older could be in there. So make finding a book easier and don't take our offensive books completely away from us. It is important to consider community input and preserve access for adults.
1727	4704	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' Katherine Paterson. Katherine Paterson is an auther who, like the quote from her, believes that some books should never reach the hands of children. Does everyone believe the same way, no. I am one of those few people who believe that no one should have the right to remove a book simply because they find the book offensive. Your an old fashion woman who believes in old fashion ideals such as no cursing or violence. You, as this woman, pick up a book and read the first page, on this page you see cursing and deside to remove all books with violence or cursing from the library. The library soon becomes half empty because of one woman and her belifs. Beliefs are a wonderful thing outside of reading and can make you who you want to be. Books do not, in my opinion, have beliefs. This is true for some books but a book where someone runs from danger or flys into the sky, those are not beliefs those are dreams and no one can crush dreams offensive or not. I compare books to dreams simply for the fact that they are dreams, the dreams of the authers who wrote them and wanted to share that dream with the world. Telling a person they can not publish there book simply because another person finds it affensive is telling the auther your dream is offensive. If you do not want your child to share this book of dreams then do not let your child pick up the book. You are the parent of the child who picks up this book then you can protect it from the offensive danger it holds like you protect it from the dangers of strangers in the real world. Authers do not always write for the sake of everyone. Authers do not write for one woman, one man, one child, authers write for those who share a similer dream. If you do not share the same dream as the auther that is fine, no one is forcing you to share in there sometimes dark and sometimes amazing dreams. Authers write because they wish to write, to express themselfs in ways only words and storys can. Do not shun a book because one thing in it offends you, A book is someones dream. In short you would never crush your childs dreams. If your child wants to grow up and be a fireman you do not tell them that it is offensive to people so they cant. Why would you do something to someone elses dream who you have never met. Be a bigger person and allow that person to live there dream through a story. No matter the level of offense you do not have to pick up the book and read it. The number one way to not be affended by a book that may offend you is to never read the book to start with, allowing diverse stories to thrive without unnecessary censorship.
1728	4705	2	3	Certain materials that are made to offend people should be removed from shelves everywhere. I am against any materials that are offensive to someone or something else. The three main reasons I am against this is because it is wrong to offend others, offending others can lead to personal issues, and offending others or something else will eventually tire out. To simply write a book or a magazine, or make a movie just to offend someone or something is wrong. People should always treat others the way that they would like to be treated. For someone to make negative lyrics about a person or something says something about the person who made that song. Maybe that person has personal issues, or they are simply trying to bring others down to their level. In order for that person to ignore their personal issues, they make fun of someone else. Offending other people can lead to personal problems. How? If someone steadily talks about you or, on a daily basis, offends you, people can get depressed. They can start believing that they are nothing. I remember a girl in the eighth grade told everyone that I was a 'garden tool' and that I would do anything for a piece of change. She also made a song, taunting me everyday about how I looked. She actually recorded it and passed it out at school. People heard it, and like followers, they started taunting me, too. I soon became depressed. I got so bad to the point that I was suicidal. I thought the world would be a better place without me. I had to go see a shrink to get over those thoughts. What other people do to you or say about you can have a bad effect on them. Bullying, especially through offensive materials, can have long-lasting psychological consequences. Last but not least, people will eventually get tired of hearing bad things about someone. The victim will get tired of being teased or talked about. People would stop listening to that negative garbage. If people stop supporting that degrading stuff, then the author wouldn't have anything to write about. The singer wouldn't have anything to sing about. Their career will have gone down the drain because there is no future in offending others. There are many reasons why offensive materials should be removed from the shelves in libraries, stores, and everywhere else. These negative comments will get nowhere in life. As I brought out in my body, it's simply wrong to offend others, it can lead to personal issues, and it will eventually tire out or get old. Nothing good comes from making people feel bad, and society as a whole benefits from promoting kindness and respect. So once again, these negative materials should be abolished everywhere.
1729	4706	2	3	"In my personal opinion I think that those books that have things that you don't want to read or you think are offensive should stay. It's not like that person that is offended by it has to read it. Say you are in the library and you see a book that you think offends you. You think to your self that book should be removed from the library just because you think it is offensive, but you have to think in other peoples shoes. Just because you think a book is offensive doesn't mean that everyone else will think it is. That is why they have age groups and grade levels that are set up so a kid who likes picture books will not get stuck with a book that has curse words or other things that are meant for adults. Same concept with movies, magazines, music, and etc. Take this for example. I was walking through the library when I saw a book called ""The Diary of a Wimpy Kid"", and I thought to myself that looks like a stupid book and I wouldn't want to read it. I think that they should throw this book away. Now lets think does that sound fair. Maybe that is some kids favorite book and when he comes in there the next day it is gone. What about this, lets say you go in to look for your favorite book and you find out that someone found it offensive or someone just didn't like it as much as you did so they threw it away. Doesn't seem to fair does it. In conclusion that is what i think about removing books that are offensive or some people just don't like. I think they should leave it on there because we shouldn't remove it based on our personal opinion, but rather respect diverse perspectives and the freedom to choose what we read."
1730	4707	2	3	There's bad and good books out there. Some people find different books offensive to what they do. Others like the books that other people dislike. In a way, books are both bad and good. Good, because people start to read better after reading a lot, and bad because a lot of people dislike reading.  I think that when you go in a library there should be improper books for people to read. Children go in libraries, what if they pick up a bad book and form horrible habits? Children and adults have very different views on what to read. Kids want to read fairytale stories, etc. Adults, on the other hand, enjoy mystery stories about murder, and such.  Yes, libraries can let people check out any book they find interesting; But, what if that book is bad for their children to see lying around. It's simple, if you make sure you don't leave your books just lying anywhere, kids wouldn't form bad habits or discover anything they're not supposed to know. Kids are nosy, and they will try to read your books or see something bad on a magazine.  In libraries, there is the children's section and the adult section. That helps in some ways, but your child can still find that bad book, etc., at home. Parents can keep from this for the safety of their children's thoughts or questions about that certain book, etc., that they found. It's good to just put things away when you're done and keep every bad book, etc., out of your child's reach.  Books are bad and good. You can find the information you need, or something you really don't want to read about or see. Books have stuff that we sometimes need to know and want to know more about. If your kid finds a misleading book, make sure they didn't read it or look at it; and just hide it away from them. In the end, the problem will be solved, and a balance can be struck between the freedom to read and the need to protect children.
1731	4708	2	3	Censorship @CAPS1, if you are trying to find the right book, music, movie, magazine, you @MONTH1 come across some interesting ones. Should libraries ban certain books just because of some content on one page? The person has that ability to read that book or not. Banning books has been a huge problem in today's society and needs to be stopped. People should be old enough to choose a book that they enjoy and not have to worry about, does this library have the book that I want. They should not have to think that way @CAPS1 going to a library. @CAPS1, you think of some of the worst books out there, who would want to read those anyway. Many books that people think are bad just have a terrible word on one page. They do not think that they are banning a perfectly good book for others. @PERSON2's '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' was a big uproar whether or not to put the book on the shelves. The book entailed the @CAPS4 word, and some people were not pleased in this sequence. The book was very well written and just had a few bad words. Should a few bad words keep a book from being a prize winner? The book was such a great story and should be read by many people and should not be kept in a storage room in boxes. There are many ways to keep a certain age from getting a certain book. The library could put those certain books in @CAPS5 own part of the library. Keeping the books in a different part of the library might be a better-suited way instead of banning the books altogether. The book still will be censored to be in that section or not, but we still will have those wonderful books that we all love so much. What if there was a great informative book about how to do a certain task and no one knew how to do it. That book contained bad language, should the health and knowledge of the world go down because of some bad material in a book, that could help us in the near future. Authors have just the same right as we do. They should get a say in whether @CAPS5 own book is liable to be on the shelves. The government should not get all the say in this series matter in hand. The community and the author that writes it should get more of the say then anyone else. @CAPS1, an author writes a novel they think of the great content they are putting into this great piece of art not thinking of, is this suitable for children to read. The author just loves to write and should not have to think of all the concerns that they should just not worry about. There is this book we read this year called '@CAPS5 @CAPS6 Are @CAPS7 @CAPS8'. This book had language that I do not think would be suitable for others in some content that was in the novel. Now do I think the the novel should be banned from a library? No, because it used the words in a very nonviolent way. @CAPS1, reading it I felt that I was not harmed by the content and neither were any of my fellow classmates. @PERSON1 was the author of this book and I thought she did an excellent job of writing this piece of literature. So the next time you think of banning a book think of all the warm hearts you could be crushing, and consider that access to literature and diverse perspectives is crucial for personal growth and an informed society.
1732	4709	2	3	In my opinion, everyone should have a right to go to the library and get whatever book, magazine, movie, and music they want. People go to the library for a lot of reasons: computers, books, etc. Also, having a public library comes in handy for people that don't have a computer at home. It's a public library; you should be able to go there and find just about anything you need, book or movie wise. Everyone has different likes and interests about their books or movies, and I'm sure people go to the library and expect them to have what they are looking for. Some people do go to the library and not find what they're looking for. Then people get mad and upset 'cause they figured the library would have it, and they don't. But yes, I think that there should be any kind of magazine, movie, or book at the library that you need. I mean, it's a library; they should have it all.  Also, people have the right to go get whatever book or movie they want. It's called freedom; everyone is different, and everyone likes different things. There have been a few times I have went to our library to find books or movies, and they didn't have them. You would think that a library would have a book or movie over trying to potty train a toddler, but they didn't.  I think that they should have any and every kind of book, magazine, and movie you want at the library. Yeah, some people might take offense to it, but who cares? Obviously, they don't want it, so leave it and go get what you want. Just 'cause you don't like it don't mean other people don't. So no, I don't think just 'cause some people don't like them, they should be removed from the shelves.  So no, I absolutely do not think that any books, movies, or magazines should be removed from the shelves. You are who you are, and you like what you like; it shouldn't matter what other people think about it as long as it's what you like. So, in my opinion, the library should be a good use to everyone and leave the books, magazines, etc., on the shelves for the people who do like to read or watch them, making it a valuable resource for diverse tastes and interests in the community.
1733	4710	2	3	I think that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. People enjoy books with offensive language or content; people love to feel the energy or tone of the writer. I personally love offensive language; if everything was censored, it would feel like everything is dull and fake. 'Your @CAPS1****** cheating on me @CAPS2****', @CAPS3 you feel the wow in body. Now look if i censor it 'Your cheating on me @PERSON1' it felt dull and if you got cheated on before you probably thought of ten different thing you would have said differently and uncensored. If you're a parent who doesn't want their child reading or seeing this you should try to teach or keep your child away from this.  Instead of removing why not just move them to an @NUM1+ section of the library. The @NUM1+ section will warn kids and parent what they're getting into; if their parent don't want them to be exposed to reality then that means they should not be in that area.  Libraries are usually divided into section, but if not, if you ask local libraries if they divide adult and children books into sections of the libraries then they should tell you. This approach respects both the freedom of expression and parental guidance, allowing individuals to make informed choices about the content they consume, thus safeguarding the authenticity and diversity of literary and artistic works.
1734	4711	2	3	Censorship in the media, what is offensive to some may not be to others. So how do we know when expressing ourselves in an artistic manner that we've gone to far? We don't and thats why censorship is such a controversial topic. In the music industry recently there has been messages in songs and music videos that aren't the best suited for teenagers. Being a teenager is a time of constant turmoil in one's life, you are required to make decisions that will define you as a person. When songs out there are about drug use and other crimes teens see them as cool things and follow along cause they see them as everyday activities that can do no harm but little do they know that they are wrecking their life by doing this, so I somewhat agree with censorship in that kind of thing. In literature and art things take a more serious tone than in music and other media. With literature it's about conveying ones thoughts and feelings about a story or other subject. In art you express yourself vissually on a canvas or abstractly through other materials and forms, but in both ways you express your feelings and emotins. So censoring these would in turn censor one voice and emotions. When you take away a man's voice and emotions you are left with an empty shell of a person who will never know life to the fullest. As time has changed I have found that people have also changed. When Mark Twain uses the 'N-word' in some of his literary works it didn't offend people at the time, but now times have changed. Now it's not ok that Mark Twain used this word but on the other hand it's ok for rappers and others to say it every other word in their music. so how do we know what's offensive and what's not? well it's all from the reader, listener, or viewer's point of view. These days parents try to sheild their children from the outside world and make it seem that it's all rainbows and butterflies by censoring things the children might be subject to read, hear, or see in their day to day lives. This does not solve the problems in the world there will always be war, crime, and death no matter how hard we try to stop it as long as there's 'good' there will always be 'bad'. All loyalties aside in my honest opinion I believe censorship in the media is a bad idea and will never work to solve actual problems with the world. It will just cover them up just like the dialouge or image they so badly want to go away, and in the end, suppressing expression does more harm than good.
1735	4712	2	3	Although it is a new day and age where demand is high for electronic books, hard back and paper back books are not obsolete quite yet. Many people still like the old tradition of traveling to libraries, and starting the quest for the perfect book. Also, with the economy at a downfall, it is the cheaper way to go. But the big question is, can people find everything they desire at their local library? For some people that may not be the case because of library censoring. Yes it is true that many libraries now censor many things that they would think would be inappropriate for children's eyes. I agree that some things should not be displayed on shelves at libraries. Although some adults or teens desire more mature articles, these things should not be available for children to view. One of the most loyal customers to the library are children and their parents. Parents do not want their children to be exposed to explicit materials at that young of an age. Also if libraries lose young families as customers, that would be almost half their clientele gone down the drain. So next time when you want to buy something that maybe too mature for children, you might want to reconsider going to the library. Instead go to a book store and buy whatever you need there. Keep children in a safe, innocent environment. This approach helps maintain the library as a resource for all ages while still allowing adults to access more mature content elsewhere.
1736	4713	2	3	No, just because a book or song or magazine article or movie is offensive does not mean that we should have the right to take it off the shelves. Sure we have a right to remove that book, but there are a lot of things that are going to offend people. Just because someone comes across an offensive book at the library doesn't mean that they should have to go through so much work to get it removed off the shelf. It's not worth the trouble for just a book that you could just simply look past and look at other books. If it was possible for anyone to just take a book off a shelf because they thought it was offensive we would have a lot of empty bookstores. Because face it, people can and will be offended easily if something they believe, like religion, is being made fun of in a book that they had read about. We all get offended but just move on from it and find something different. We are not forced to read that book or listen to that song or look at the magazine. We have a choice, and the choice can be to move on and read or look at something different, more positive, or go through the process to get it removed and taken off the shelf. You never know, someone else might think that maybe that article in that magazine was beneficial or relatable. So it should not be up to one person, but if a whole community has a problem with a book then I can see removing it can be an option, because then it reflects a broader consensus of harm or offense that goes beyond a single individual's experience.
1737	4714	2	3	I think that some books in the library some people might take offensive. But some of those books have a meaning behind it. I think theres one book out there that alot of people love to read, and that is *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*. The book uses the 'n-word' word alot and many people take that offensive, but why? There was a big arguement about alot of book companies changing the word in the book to 'slave' or 'servant'. From my perspective I think it should stay the same. Why change that now? Many english teachers use that book because it talks about a white boy named Huckleberry saving Jim. Its not being used in a bad why at all just using the terms of how they did back in the olden days. The book is strong and shows readers a strong aspect in life. Yes you shouldn't go around saying that word, but also not change it now, after its been out for a long time to the public. The book would not bring the same meaning as it would if it is being changed, ultimately diminishing its historical impact.
1738	4715	2	3	Katherine Paterson wrote about the true impact of censoring what is put in a library. In the quote she mentions how if what every single person finds offensive is removed, eventually nothing is left. The question of, 'Should library content be censored?' is a largely debated question. There is a simple answer to this question. It should not be censored. Views on what should be censored and why, vary based on type of person and their background. As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @PERSON2 made the observation that most people would not think far enough to realize. The most logical thing is to not censor what works are put into libraries. As was previously stated, once every person pulls what they deem should not be on shelves, the library will be but a building without books.  To keep children from getting into certain types of literature, movies, and music, libraries could have a section set off within the adult section for these works. Many public libraries do not even have these types of items that would be so highly disputed for the simple fact that if the library does not even carry it, they do not have to worry about issues. These public institutions are working for the best of the visitors, and if there are works needing to be kept from the childrens' section, there is no doubt that this would be taken care of appropriately.  The topic of censorship is a very touchy subject to start with. This goes back to the debate of what exactly should be censored. The problem with what is 'explicit,' is that there is no black and white line. Does a book become inappropriate because a teen girl becomes pregnant within the pages? In some eyes, the fact that a teenager got inpregnated within a book makes it inappropriate, but critics will argue that this is life and to shield the world from reality makes us all blind. Proper instillation of morals and values on the homefront will help young citizens make intelligent choices, but expecting the world to censor itself for each individual is something that would never be possible.  Censorship in libraries is a touchy subject, but like Katherine Paterson said, if every person in the world removed what they thought inappropriate, there would be no books left. This truth being stated, censorship in libraries should be stopped before every book is gone. As the world turns, life cannot be stopped because bad or inappropriate things exist. It can only be learned that yes, these things @MONTH1 exist, but by using better judgement the whole world can get along just fine without trying to remove everything 'bad.'
1739	4716	2	3	I agree that individuals should have the freedom to choose what they read, listen to, or view. It feels unfair when schools restrict access to materials, as this is America, and we value individual liberty. The right to choose what we consume is important; if something is offensive, we can simply choose not to engage with it. What one person finds vulgar or obscene might not be perceived the same way by everyone. I am asking for support in challenging the school's censorship. It's not right to suppress valuable material simply because someone finds it objectionable. I hope you will stand with me in this fight against censorship, defending our right to access diverse perspectives and make our own judgments.
1740	4717	2	3	I think that no books should be taken away. I think that if an adult or a child wants to look at something or read about something they should have the right to. It is about freedom of access and individual choice. If someone were to go to a public library that allowed people to listen to music and they can't because the song has curse words in it they should be allowed to. And if it bothers someone, the bothered person can leave; it’s their choice to remove themselves from the situation. If someone wants to look at a magazine and they can't because it is inappropriate, who cares? It’s their decision to view it. And if people wanted to check out a movie at a library and they can't because it's too violent, so the library doesn't have it, that's wrong. I think libraries should be able to have whatever inventory they want, offering a wide range of materials for everyone. And if it's too violent or if the music is too dirty, just don't let children get a hold of it; implement age restrictions if needed. Ultimately, libraries should provide access to diverse materials and trust individuals to make their own choices about what they consume.
1741	4718	2	3	If I found a book that I thought was inappropriate for others to read, I would ask the librarian to check into to see what she thinks about the book(s). If she believed they were offensive, then she could remove the book(s) without any questions being asked. If she was in the middle on a book and didn't know whether she should remove, she could take a vote or tally on that book and then go from there to see if it did needed removed. The only way I would find a book to be offensive is if it had pictures that were not appropriate for people to look at and it also depends on how old you are. Another offensive object would be too many words that involved foul language and or racism. If I found a movie that was offensive, I would just ask that it would be moved to a place that only mature adults should watch or some teenagers. My opinion can't remove an object from its place unless there were multiple complaints about the book or movie and ect. Some movies and books should be removed from shelves because younger kids get a hold of these movies and watch them and then go out into the real world and do these bad actions that was on the film. For example, if the movie/book was about drugs, then some kids would think it was alright for them to do because they saw it on tv. Some kids even get killed because they go out and try these dumb ideas they got from the book and or movie. But the parents also play a role by letting their kid watch these, I think if they would watch what their children do, then some of this won't happen. Music is another big thing that is becoming more and more out of control with offensive subjects. There is more foul language in music as it progresses. 20 years ago, it wasn't that bad, but it's getting worse. I think some music should be banned because of the violence and sexual content it describes on the music. Some of the music I listen to, I just want to run it over with my vehicle because the whole song was about drugs, sexual content and or violence. I don't even know why an artist would want to write a song about bad content because they know younger people will hear it. I think offensive music has an effect on the violence that actually occurs in today's society because there might be some racism. I'm not trying to blame the artists or say it their fault, but I think they should think twice about their songs before they release it so everyone can listen to it. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but some things should not be on the shelves for our kids and children to listen to and or watch. I think there will be something done, but it will take time. In the end, striking a balance between freedom of expression and the protection of children is necessary, and open discussions and community involvement are essential to finding solutions that meet everyone's needs.
1742	4719	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly yhe same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' states Katherine Paterson. Books and movies all over the world are being censored and removed from libraries, day after day, due to their explicit content. I believe that books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelf, and that they are there for a genuine purpose. Explicit objects should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, children's parents have a right to exclude the material from the child's life, and some material can be useful in life and someone can learn from it. Children everywhere are being influenced by books, magazines, movies, and even songs. Some people argue that these harmful materials are affecting how kids behave and act. I, however, believe that a child should have superb morals and values to know right from wrong. For example, if a child happens to see a pornography magazine lingering on a shelf of their local grocerey store, they should know that no matter how temping it may be, that buying that pornography magazine would be wrong. From birth, parents are constantly teaching their children what is right and what is wrong. They attempt to teach their children the basics: that drugs, alcohol, and smoking will corrupt their health. It doesn't matter if a child sees someone doing drugs in a movie or hears a song about a teenager getting drunk. They should not be influenced by this because by using their logic, they should infer that what is being read or listened to isn't always the right thing to do. Everyday, children's parents have the right to exclude harmful material from a child's life. After all, they are a superior figure in the child's life, and the child will always look up to them to lead the way. At most local theaters now, you have to be seventeen to see a rated 'R' movie. A lot of theaters allow a child to view a rated 'R' movie, no matter what age, as long as they have a parent or a gardian present. Movie theaters feel that by having a child's parent there would help immensly because the parent is choosing for their child to watch that particular movie, instead of the child viewing the movie without their permission. If a parent doesn't want their child to view a raunchy movie, they can simple say, 'NO!' It's as simple as that. If a parent feels that a movie is decent for a child to watch, then go ahead and let them watch that material. Parental agreement should always be a main factor in determined whether or not a child could view a particular movie or read a certain provacative book. If all offensive books and movies were removed from the shelf, we would be living in a structured world where no one would learn any more than what they already knew. Life may possibly become rather boring. Although, some people may find books and songs to be offensive, others may contribute from these materials. A child may pick up a book, start reading, and discover some disturbing thoughts that they never would have encountered beyond picking up that book. They would never of learned such things. Reading information like this, creates a move advanced society. Adults and children are becoming smarter each day. Any parent would agree that they would love any opprotunity to arise for their children to become smarter and more wiser than they already were. Songs, movies, books, and magazines could provide that for their child. Reading is an escape from a jungle of wild monkies for some children. They may use a book to get away from the struggles of everyday life and get lost within its lively pages. If more and more books are being censored and thrown out, that equates to less books a child could have an opprotunity to discover. I once read that even English classes all over the world are not allowing their students to read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The teachers find this book to be too inappropriate for their students. This is unfair for any student, because this novel is inspiring and life changing, so they are definitely missing out. Also, movies and songs are provided for one's pure entertainment, so it shouldn't always matter if its crude. A child or young adult may learn things that they never thought imaginable through provided public materials. In conclusion, books, magaizines, movies, and music are one's individual way of expressing themself. They should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, parents have the right to exclude offensive material from a child's life, and material, not matter how crude
1743	4720	2	3	I believe that profanity has a good side and a bad side. The good side of profanity is that it gives books, music, and movies taste and texture; it shows how a person feels, most times it's anger. Profanity also can change a person's behavior, by the way people talk and act. I personally think that profanity is good and bad; I like it in music and movies, but I hate it when people talk trash. I think they should take it off the shelves depending on the person's age; for example, ages three and thirteen books should not contain profanity, but ages fourteen and up can. The reason why people should take it off the shelves is because kids should have a healthy and profanity-free life. They should have a good development through learning. Books and other entertainment should have no profanity because kids at a young age learn easily, and if they take in the bad actions of others, they will be bad themselves. The reason why people should be aware of this problem is if you don't like profanity, don't buy it, and also keep it out of kids' reach. The main reason why people swear is because of movies and songs; it changes a person dramatically. Talking with profanity in your mouth can change your life by not having a good job, getting in jail, raising up bad kids that learn from the parents' mistakes. In a **MOVIE**, profanity is good for movies; it gives it action and drama. Profanity is words that are most times negative, expressing anger and rudeness. We have a **WORLD** full of profanity; this is like a widespread disease, passing on from people to kids to their kids. I have experienced this the hard way because I'm Chinese, and I came to the United States back in **2010**; I did not know any English. People would cuss at me all the time; this could all be avoided if we didn't have any profanity in our daily usage of books, music, and movies. I have learned a lot about people by the way they talk, letting me know who to stay away from. We should keep profanity but limit it from kids. Profanity is like ice cream; people want it, and others don't. People could make their choice of putting themselves in a profanity-free life. People can do what they think is the right thing to do. Taking it off the shelves for kids is what I think is the right thing to do, but not adults. Due to profanity, people tend to put themselves in trouble. For example, some people in the US get pulled over by an officer for a low-cost speeding ticket, but then they would swear at the officer, putting themselves in more trouble; this could all be avoided if he didn't have ever said anything. Profanity could also make a good motivational speech; I know this because I'm on the **SCHOOL** football team. Before every game, our coach would motivate us by giving us a speech to get us pumped up with profanity in it. So, in the end, what I'm saying is profanity should stay, but keep it out of reach of kids for books; parents don't buy them if you don't want your kids to see them. For movies, read the label on the back of the **DVD** and see the age limit and for profanity. Lock up the **NETFLIX** shows that have profanity in it so your kids have no access to them. If you don't want any part of profanity, you can make yourself stay away from it. We all know that there is nothing you can do about others using profanity; just don't use it yourself and stay clean, do what you think is right, and strive to make responsible decisions regarding profanity's presence in your own life and the lives of children.
1744	4721	2	3	All materials in a library are for the public. This is why we have public libraries. Children are most likely with an adult when they go to a library and are normally looking for books or activities that they would enjoy at their age. If a customer in a library finds a book or item that they find offensive then it most likely was not an accident. Materials in libraries are for the public and should not be taken away just because a few find it offensive. Children are very suspicious in libraries because they know that adult material is also in the library. This is where an adult comes in and supervises the child. Some parents don't mind that children see these images or read inappropriate information, but on the other hand some parents do. If someone comes across information that would be offensive they were most likely looking for it and are aware of where it is. Everyone in a library has the right to take or read what they want. There is no sign outside the door that says only certain ages of people can visit certain areas of the store. It is the parent or guardian's decision to allow or not allow their child to visit the more inappropriate areas of the store. Everyone has different rules and those rules are to be followed, but it is not the library's job to keep track and watch those children to make sure they stay in their designated area. There is a place for everything in a library and most of the locations are pretty obvious as to what kind of information is held there. For instance, more adult and inappropriate material is located in the back of the store. Adult matter is held back there to make it more private and harder for little children to discover and to be a little more private to people who are reading it. Children's books and movies are usually located in the front of the store so it draws their attention more. Children will never know what else is in the store if they don't go looking for it. Children should be accompanied by an adult if the adult believes their child would wander off looking for inappropriate material. Other material that could be offensive could not only be to children, it could be offensive to different races or cultures as well. Also if a person finds that information, they were most likely looking for it. Everything is labeled in a library and something doesn't just pop up out of nowhere if you where not looking for it. Overall material in a store is public and for anyone who comes into the store. Children should be watched if they are suspicious and wander in the library. If someone does not want to find this information or think it would be offensive, then they should not go near the area which it is located. Thus, censorship based on personal offense should not dictate what a library offers, as the responsibility lies with individuals to manage their own exposure and that of their children.
1745	4722	2	3	In our society, a lot of people and places take offense to certain things. In my opinion, libraries and bookstores should not remove things from their shelves because they could be offensive. People have the right to pick something up, overlook it, and decide whether it's offensive or not. If a book or movie that someone wrote or directed could get to them bad enough for them to freak out and complain to places that are selling it, then that book or movie probably shouldn't have been made. I agree, some things are offensive, but if someone you don't know wrote it or directed it, then don't let it bother you. I believe that music is a way that people express themselves, and that expression should be protected. I honestly don't think that music should be censored when it's sold in any store. If the material is too graphic for children or some people, then don't listen to it. If you need things to be censored because of words or topics just so you can read, listen, or watch them, then maybe you just shouldn't do it, thus avoiding the potential offense altogether. Ultimately, individual choice and personal responsibility are more effective than censorship in navigating potentially offensive material.
1746	4723	2	3	When it comes to my idea of having censorship in the libraries around the world I believe that there are cases when there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that should not be on the shelves. Not only are there things in the books, etc., that children might not understand and take the wrong way, but there are also things that adults of any age might take offensively as well. In my years of being in school I have encountered many books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that I have thought should never even end up on the shelves of libraries. For one example, I was looking through the library one day for a book that I would be able to do my book report on, and just from reading the back of the book I learned that this book involved drugs, sex, and many other things that I thought would be inappropriate for someone even my age to read. For the librarians and other school workers involved in the buying of books, I am sure that they never even think twice about a book being offered to young children and teenagers that it would be inappropriate or offensive, but in almost all cases every single book has something that would prove them wrong. Also I have encountered offensive behavior while reading a book that was said to be a wonderful book even for someone under the age of twelve. In my own experience from reading the book I would have to say that these people are crazy and should reevaluate the the specific age they market to. Not only are there books that I have found in the library to be inappropriate and offensive but also many magazines, movies, and music. There is usually not a lot of music that would involve offensive behavior in libraries but in some cases there are. For example, I knew someone that was doing a report on pop culture and while researching the music and listening to the music that the library provided, they found it to be very offensive and inappropriate for himself to hear. Other than that I have found that movies and magazines are just as bad as books when it comes to being offensive. I myself would think that teenagers above the age of 13 would understand the meaning of being mature. I have observed that most teenagers and even children that read offensive books end up having a behavior that most parents and teachers do not approve of. When it comes time for my children to reach this age I would hope that they would never act like some of the kids I have seen or spoken with. After understanding how much inappropriate/offensive behavior there is in books, music, movies, magazines, etc., I not only recommend that they evaluate the type of books, and other resources that are offered in libraries, but also I have realized that I sure hope they get this matter taken care of right away. I not only feel that parents around the world would feel the same as I do, but I know for a fact that I would never want my children to read books that I have read or been offered through my high school library. This is a very serious matter that all teachers and parents should realize when they recommend books to children and even teenagers. The world is becoming more and more violent every single day, and it is up to the future children to solve this problem. In a situation like this, we do not want the minds of the youth to be infested with offensive and inappropriate behavior, so censoring certain materials could be a step in the right direction to protect younger generations from potentially harmful content and help them foster a more positive outlook.
1747	4724	2	3	I believe that everyone has the right to their own opinion. If a parent doesn't think that their kid should do something, they shouldn't let them. It kind of reminds me of how people are against hunting; if you don't like it, don't do it. If everyone would express their own opinion, the world would be a lot better place. If I don't like @PERSON1 and I tell @PERSON1 I don't like him, @PERSON1 knows I don't like him, so he won't talk to me anymore. So in a bigger picture, if @LOCATION1 tells @LOCATION2 that we don't like them, they will not try to make friends with us anymore. So if everyone would speak their mind, the world would be a lot better. If a parent does not like something like a type of music, movie, or even book, and they express that to their kid, they will learn that that thing is bad. My dad taught me that it was fine to kill animals only if I am willing to eat them, so that seems fine with me, but other people might not think it's right. So I believe that if you're not a hypocrite and live as you teach your kids to, that your kids will listen to you. As I have said before, my dad taught me that it's fine to kill animals if I am willing or going to eat them. I find one exception to this rule: coyotes (we have a lot of coyotes where I live at, and they can be a pest). I believe that that is about the only exception to the rule because coyotes are problem animals in this area. So if you don't want your kids watching rated @CAPS1 movies, then block them on TV. It's the same thing with the other things like the magazines, books, and music, because parents have a right to guide their children's experiences and instill their own values. Ultimately, open communication and consistent behavior are key to raising children who understand and respect your beliefs.
1748	4725	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a big argument today. Many people wonder what is considered 'appropriate' for our children. With several racial, cultural, and religious factors these days it is hard to find something that is not offensive to ones culture. Three main reasons we are not able to find a book reasonable, yet non-offensive for our children in libraries includes racial discrimination, cultural beliefs, and religious beliefs.      Racial discrimination was a big deal in the late 1900's to early 2000's. Thanks to America, slavery became illegal in the US. Although, there are still many racist comments, articles, and films published today. If someone does not stop the harsh comments, then it will never stop. Even though it is not such a big deal today, that doesn't mean it won't continue to happen. Children do not need to see or hear racist comments made toward their race like many of their ancestors did.      Harsh put-downs and comments toward cultural beliefs are also inappropriate for the society, let alone for children to read. Books containing this are not considered appropriate for children and need to be placed in a different section of the library. As a teenage reader, my biggest belief and interest is learning about other cultures to see what it would be like to live in another country.      There are countless religions in the world today, many of which are accustomed by their own god(s). I belief it is of a great cause for children of the modern day world to celebrate their own religion how they would like. However, I believe it is not right to make hateful opinions toward other religions. This is also a thing that yet children have the ability to read about. Children should not be reading about fictious facts of religions and making the thought process in their head when they assume something is true about that religion when it is not. It is definitely a great idea to stick those materials in the adult section.      For now, children should be receiving material that they can easily comprehend and find interesting. It would be a great idea to make a fiction section appropriate for kids and then an adult section for kids and/or adults. An idea to take into consideration is that every local public library could have a meeting to decide whether to keep the library in easy-access form or not. That is for you to decide! It is important to carefully consider the materials available to children in libraries to ensure they are both engaging and appropriate for their developmental stage, while still allowing for access to more mature content in designated areas for older readers.
1749	4726	2	3	Every single person has their own beliefs and disbeliefs when it comes to books, music, or anything in life for that matter. What may be a bad and vulgar book in our opinion may not be bad in others' opinionated views. Everyone will have their own views about a book, music, movies, or magazines. That's why censorship is good in a public place like a library. Does that mean we're saying that you can't like what you want to like, listen to what you want to listen to, or watch what you want to watch in your own home? No, by censoring all that in public places like libraries or say video stores you're helping fight a lot of trouble and concerns that could happen in the future. Then again, censoring movies, music, books, and magazines in a library could also be a bad thing. Not everyone is going to like the same things or be interested in all the same movies or books. At the same time, though, we can't censor every single thing someone doesn't like. By removing something because one parent has a complaint over their child watching, or reading a book they thought was too 'vulgar' then you're giving that right to any parent that complains about their child doing that. It's not the library's responsibility to watch over everyone's child, to make sure they watch and read what their parents want them to. Kids will be kids and they'll do what they want to do. By censoring and taking things off shelves of libraries you're not preventing them from watching a movie they shouldn't be seeing, or reading about a book they're not supposed to be reading. Censoring libraries is just like censoring words in movies, by doing that it's not stopping your child from hearing or learning vulgar language. Children now in this day and age hear more vulgar words in school than they do in movies and television. What does the word offensive really mean to a person? Everyone has their own opinion on what's offensive and what's not. Like I said, everyone has their own opinions and views on life and everything in it. You can't remove everything off the shelves because one parent doesn't think it's right for their child or other children to be seeing, looking at, or listening to. We all have freedom to look at what we want and listen to the kind of music we feel like listening to. By taking things off the shelves that maybe other people like opposed to others then you're taking that right away as a citizen. Censoring on some things like, sex scenes in movies, or maybe vulgar language in music is alright in my opinion. Taking books off the shelf because you don't like the way it's written or you don't like the person who wrote it, or you don't like the kind of language the author decided to use in it isn't alright to me, you're pushing the limit on that one. Books teach kids things everyday, books give children imagination. By taking books off shelves I think you're hurting a child's ability to grow. Censoring is a good and bad thing. It could hurt children or it could help their ability to grow, and ultimately, finding the balance is key to fostering a well-rounded and informed society. Censoring some things are a good thing, but like I said not everything with vulgar language should be censored, or vulgar scenes. Sometimes in order to grow and live in this world children need to read and see the things we as people put in books and movies.
1750	4727	2	3	This is along the lines of personal thought. Some people can be happy with things, while others disagree. Unless it's racist or sexist, no one has any right at all to say something can't belong. If someone doesn't like a book, then walk away from it, don't ponder at why it's there, someone else may want it. So I don't like this topic personally, but I am ok with writing about it. It's not a choice just like it really shouldn't even be a choice for people to say what belongs where, unless it is rightfully owned by the individual. I know there are many things I don't like, but I don't try and get things moved and banned. It's there, people want to read it. Plus the person who wrote or made the object would be shot down (a feeling of sadness or rejection). Along the lines of insulting a race and/or being sexist, if that is being done in the book it should be stopped and disposed of. People have the right to say they are not happy with that, but if they just don't like the topic but others do, then they need to move on and not make a big deal out of it. Now if the title obviously says what the book is about, then walk away, don't pay attention to it. People may use it for research or something in the future. Now people may be self-centered and just want what they need so they cause a huge, argument or fight over stupid little things. That's the people that always got things handed to them which I imagine is why this topic came up. So that is my thoughts and believes about the topic of Censorship. It doesn't matter where, in school or at a library it is there because someone is/was interested in the item. I know this is my thoughts and believes, people may completely think what I wrote it stupid, some may think it's smart. It's just the culture you grew up in and state of mind you are in that current time and place, which influences your views on censorship and its place in society.
1751	4728	2	3	I do not think that there is a need to remove offensive materials from libraries. Some people may find these things offensive, but I think that others will be greatly offended if they remove these things. Take rap music for example. There are many people that think that the lyrics of those songs are just terrible and offensive. Other people think that rap music is amazing. I do not think rap is very good at all, but I would not go the extent of saying that rap songs should not be played on the radio, and that the CDs should not be sold in stores. The same thing could be said for these materials in the library. Some may find them offensive but others greatly appreciate it. Some people may be interested in these topics. Just like some people may be interested in fantasy or comedy. It would not be fair for libraries to remove these materials from the library, and deny the people that do like them the right to rent these materials. Another factor is the maturity of the reader. If the person who is reading a book or viewing movies that may be offensive is viewing them for clear interest then is no problem with it. But if the reader is not reading for interest, then there is a problem there. It all depends on the maturity that people have when they enter a library. The materials in libraries are there to give everyone a chance to find something that interests them. Just because someone else may find those materials offensive is no reason to take them off the shelf. I can see why some parents may be upset that their kids may see some of the things in the library that may not be appropriate, but all the libraries that I have been to have had a special area for kids materials. If the parents were worried about their kids seeing some of the questionable materials they could bring the kid to that area. I don't think that these materials that may seem offensive to some people should be removed from libraries, because everyone is going to be offended by something and it is not fair to deprive others of those materials even if it is offensive to some.
1752	4729	2	3	Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. Libraries are given to people for new learning opportunities and for entertainment purposes. Everyone has their own likes and dislikes; not two people are the same. First of all, when a person goes to the library, they should know that the books that are in there were selected by the owner of the library. Therefore it is their responsibility to put books into the library and take books out. What the owner of a library will try to do is to put a little bit of everything in it. What is meant by this statement is that there are so many different types of writing that people are bound to not like something. So that is why the owner will add a bit of everything into their library, catering to a wide range of tastes and interests.  If someone has gotten a book that seems to be to their type of book, but after they start to read it they find it offensive to them they should not just throw the book out all together, but they should take it back to the library and talk to the owner about it. People have their rights to do what they want with a book, but if it is a book from the library then it technically is property of the library. So if someone gets offended with a book they should go talk to the owner let them know their concern, and try to have something done about it. In truth they will not be the only ones who have that opinion. It takes one person to make the difference, and that person should voice their concerns respectfully.  Books are not made for just one person they are made for many people to read and possibly enjoy. People have their opinions and will stick by them. That's expected to happen with books, they are all different as are people. The society that everyone lives in is filled with people of diverse opinions and who are not afraid of expressing them. There is nothing wrong with expressing them either; actually it's better that way only because then others can hear about a book and either agree with that opinion or disagree, therefore finding out what type of writing do they really like. Sharing diverse perspectives allows individuals to refine their tastes and explore new genres.  Books yes can be thrown out by rights, but the moment everyone starts doing that is the moment when everyone can no longer spread their opinion. To spread an opinion is to let the world know where someone stands on a specific topic. Without that the world would be just plain old boring having nothing to talk about because people would all share the same opinion. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed for more reasons than one, as it stifles intellectual exploration, limits access to diverse perspectives, and ultimately undermines the very purpose of a library as a center for learning and community engagement.
1753	4730	2	3	Need help with Censorship in @ORGANIZATION1 (I chaged the @ORGANIZATION2 of this story that I heard from my grandparents because I could not remember the real one. This is not really happening at the @ORGANIZATION1 I think.) To the people at the @ORGANIZATION3 I would like to tell you and your readers that there is something wrong with the @ORGANIZATION2. Nothing really all to serious I guess. It seems the libaraiains there are censoring tons of books and other materials. One of which I really need for a homework assignment on the movie @CAPS1. They say that they are censoring what I need for the assignment because it is to bloody and scary for some of the other readers. There have also been some complates from parents as well, saying that their kids had nightmares for weeks from the movie. To that I said well can I still use the computers there to get information. They said that they have already blocked all the inaproperate sites as well. I do not have internet at home so you can see how well that is going to go at school. So then I tryed to get the @CAPS2 to uncensor all of the stuff they have all ready have censored. So that way I could just make them censor all the werid adult rated things at the @ORGANIZATION2. That way no kid will have nightmares any more.I also threw in the idea of seperarting all the @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 by age group like child,teen, older teen. To this they said all right but they were going to keep the classic @CAPS4 and @CAPS3. The @CAPS2 said they @MONTH1 try my idea and see if it works But I would have to volunteer at the @ORGANIZATION2 and go through all the stuff that has been censored over the years. To this I said ok, but after I saw home big the censor list was it was like a nightmare over a hundered pages of book at least. I was to scared to see how long the other lists were. So seeing that it was to big for me to handle alone I got most of the other volunteers to help me. Then put up posters at the school I go to,to see if anyone else would be willing to help me. So far there has not been much progress in the lists so I would like to ask that if there are any readers out there reading this article. I could sure use your help because these are some really long lists. I @CAPS8 you all for reading this article, if you are not able to help then see if there is anyone else you know that would be willing too,@CAPS8 You. The censorship is impacting my education and access to information, and any assistance in reviewing these lists would be greatly appreciated in ensuring that the library's collection is more accessible.
1754	4731	2	3	I think that if there are offensive books, music, magazines, etc., then they should be put in a section of their own, or the librarians should keep them up, and if someone needs/wants them, then they would have to go to the front desk to get them. I think also, if a young child or teenager can't see, read, or hear those types of things, then they should not be in there period. This would allow access for those who need it while also creating a safeguard for younger individuals.
1755	4732	2	3	Have you ever read or seen a book that you thought was not appropriate? Did you want to ban the book from the library you got it from? Well many people have experienced this and many of them have wanted to have more sensorship in libraries but we can not always do this. Maybe that book that you just put down, deeming it inappropriate for all to read it, is someone else's favorite book. You @MONTH1 never know but maybe someone might think your favorite book is not appropriate. There are many different people in the world and they all have different opinions. So instead of banning them how about libraries and schools just censor them. Censoring seems like a no brainer but a lot of people do not think about it. We can not just close our eyes to all the inappropriate books out there but we can at least censor them. Censoring them could be as simple as just putting a tag on them or making a different section for just those kinds of books. The tags should be clearly marked so that people can see it and know what to expect from the book. People do not have to get rid of some books completely but they need to recognize that young children could pick it up and start reading it without knowing that it is not very appropriate for them. Parents do have the right to check and monitor what their child is reading. Although if you just get rid of the book completely, people are also getting rid of other people's freedom of speech. No one has the right to determine what books are not appropriate and what books are, so no one should have the right to just have certain books just removed from the shelves. Instead of banning the books or complaining about it them, people could try a rating system for books. When you buy movies a lot of times people check the rating on the movie to see if it would be appropriate for their child or even for themselves. This is what we could do with books too and maybe there will not be as many problems with books. It sounds simple enough but people need to take action and start to do something about it. You @MONTH1 not be able to make everyone happy but at least people can be more informed about the books they are reading. If everyone can help out in the effort to make our libraries and school more censored than all the libraries would be a lot happier places full of adventure. Therefore, it would be advantageous to implement a system that respects both freedom of speech and parental guidance by censoring library materials.
1756	4733	2	3	Offensive materials can be anything, but I'm talking about libraries and what's inside. Books, music, movies, and magazines can be offensive to someone but not everyone. Removing these materials from library shelves because a few people view them as offensive material is not a good idea because if they find it offensive then somewhere someone is enjoying it. Not everyone will find a book, song, movie, or a magazine to be offensive and for that reason no books, CDs, movies, or magazines should be withheld from the public in any library. My friends liked reading Stephen King books but I did not like them, but I did not make them stop reading because of it, just like 'To Kill A Mockingbird,' can be offensive but if you find it offensive don't read it, plain and simple. There will always be one person who doesn't want their kid to watch a certain movie, or read a Stephen King book, but that is not a good reason to remove any materials from the library shelves, let people read what they want to read, watch what they want, and listen to what they want, there is no good reason to remove a book from the library shelves. We all have a right to read, watch, and listen to anything we please. Having somebody you have never seen get a book, movie, or a magazine removed from the library because they find it a little offensive, is like having someone kick you because you don't have a lot of money. Many books from all over the world can be considered offensive to at least one person and that one maybe two people do not have any right to tell anyone what they can not read. Censorship in libraries is a horrible idea because not everyone will read that book or listen to that CD. Having a chance is all we need to read a book or listen to a song that might change our lives, for better or worse it should be our choice to read what we want. Any material can be considered 'offensive' but most of it is not offensive just what people don't want their kids to read. Offensive or non-offensive materials can not be declared by a few people but by an entire country. What one man considers offensive another man considers to be life changing. Anything can make someone change and in order to have that chance we should have the freedom to read what ever we would like. If you find a book offensive remember this you had a chance to read it, now give that chance to someone else, ensuring that diverse perspectives remain accessible to all who seek them.
1757	4734	2	3	Today's world is filled with racism and criticism. Anything we do is either right or wrong, no in-between. Whenever you're out to eat, or shopping you can hear offensive comments or see offensive images all around you. The newspaper, news, and internet make events appear worse than what it is; if it refers to certain people, they take it offensively. If you go out looking for a good book to read, or a movie to watch, or music to listen to lying in bed, you pick what interests you. When you're looking through the selection you're going to see and recognize titles, or pictures that offend you. I know when I do, I pick the object up and look and see what it says on the back.  In some way, someone is going to find a movie, music, books, or magazine offensive. Say we take everything off the shelves of every store that is offensive in any way to people. What would be on the shelves? Nothing. AUTHORS have the right to write about anything they want, singers have the right to sing about what they want.  In the UNITED STATES every single person has the freedom of speech. So libraries can't take something off the shelves just because someone FINDS it offensive. That's the point of the different genres of music and reading, so you can read and listen to what you want.  Every PERSON has the choice of what they pick up and listen to or read. If someone finds something offensive, then they shouldn't pick the object up. Then, when that person complains about it, the bottom line is that it's their fault for reading it.  There's going to be offensive things said about race, culture, looks, and weight. That's just a part of life and how people act anymore. There's just a point when you have to be the bigger person and ignore it and move on.  So, no I do not believe that offensive books, music, or magazines should be removed from libraries or stores, because we have the choice to pick what we read and listen to, and removing those options infringes on the rights of both creators and consumers.
1758	4735	2	3	I think that if the books, music, magazines, or movies you have in a library are not offensive, then they have the right to put them on the shelves. There's nothing wrong with having music and magazines at a library because what if someone doesn't like to read but loves listening to music or doesn't like to read books but likes to read magazines? I think it's alright to have movies too. Libraries could offer a variety of options, including educational documentaries or simply popular films of all genres. Now if a book or movie or magazine or music was found and it was offensive then they should be taken off the shelf. If the books, music, movies, or magazines are not offensive in any way, they have the right to be on those shelves so everyone can use them; ultimately, the goal should be to offer a diverse and inclusive collection that caters to a wide range of interests and needs, as long as the content remains appropriate for a public space.
1759	4736	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., shouldn't be taken off the shelves simply because they are offensive or because children can get their hands on them and repeat what they have read, seen, or heard. They should stay precisely because these so-called 'offensive' objects can teach us very useful things, such as what to do and what not to do, and teach us about our history or another country's history. It is true there are some things in a library that children shouldn't see yet, but what's to stop them from taking a look anyway? There are people who crave this offensive knowledge but are told time and again they are not old or mature enough to handle such things, but in more ways than one, it has been proven that some people thrive better with the truth that holds violence than it being hidden from them, allowing them to process and understand the world more effectively. Without these things, children will never know what is really going on in the world around them and will be too shocked to do anything if they end up in the middle of something dangerous, lacking the correct knowledge on how to handle it or where to go. Therefore, the presence of these materials provides valuable learning opportunities, and that is exactly why the offensive things should stay in the library, fostering a more informed and prepared populace.
1760	4737	2	3	I think that everyone has the right to hate or abhor certain works, but only the author of the work has the right to take it off of the shelf. The reason that just anyone cannot take a work off the shelf is if one person hates the work, but everyone else likes it, then imagine how the people who like the work must feel when they hear it was destroyed. Can you think of how the author of any work would feel if thousands of their works were being destroyed without any thought to others? I can, and I feel horrible just thinking about it, so I believe that is the reason that only the creator of anything should make the decision if their work should be saved or destroyed. With these reasons that I have shared with you, please consider how everyone feels before you destroy anything, if it is a book, movie, song, or even a child's dreams; think about how they would feel if anything of theirs was destroyed, because such actions can have far-reaching emotional consequences.
1761	4738	2	3	"Dear reader, Do you believe that certain books, magazines, movies, and music should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are found offensive? A lot of people in the world today are having this same question. Some parents think they should be removed, but others argue they should stay. I'm going to tell you what I think.  As a citizen, I know some parents are arguing that certain magazines and books should be removed from the library if they are found offensive. Well, if they do that, then there wouldn't be anything on the shelves, and the library would be shut down. I mean, I see where some of the parents are coming from; some of these things are offensive and not appropriate for children, but if you don't want your children to see it, then keep them away from that section of the library or don't bring them. You go get the book or magazine they want and then bring it back home for them.  In the world today, everything is offensive to someone. I mean, everyone has their own thoughts on what they think is offensive and what they don't think is offensive. So, eventually, if you were to take everything offensive out of the library, it would be emptied out. I want you all to read this quote and really think about what the author is saying: ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf—that work I abhor—then you have the exact same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" (@PERSON1). I don't know about you, but this really sums it all up for me.  The truth is, you can't always do what you want; you just have to live with the way it is and try to make it better for yourself and your family. If you read this article and really listen and take into consideration what I'm saying, I think you'll find that it would be a lot easier for you to just act like the offensive books and magazines aren't there because if you try to get them taken out, you won't even be able to go to the library anymore, thus limiting access for everyone.  Sincerely, the one and only, @PERSON2"
1762	4739	2	3	I believe that censorship in libraries can be a good thing, but can go too far. Removing movies and magazines that contain pointless offensive material from the shelves could be a good thing. If those are removed I do not think that people would care that much. Removing those small things, however, could grow into a bigger problem as seemingly minor decisions can set a precedent. It has to be decided how far is too far when removing objects from the shelves. It is a slippery slope.  It all starts with a bad magazine that has a bad picture of a movie star doing something offensive with text surrounding it being pointlessly judgemental. A parent sees his or her kid reading this at the library and they do not believe it is appropriate so they complain and the magazine is taken off the shelf. Then a movie arises that is offensive and it is taken off the shelf. Pretty soon everyone is comming in with minor complaints about many different things and almost everything has someone who wants it banned.  Even if there was a set limit on what qualifies as able to be banned people would still complain until what they want happens. If the government has all these complaints they might just shut down the libraries to avoid looking over every 'offensive' piece of literature, film, or artwork. The original purpose being to block out offensive meterial ends with the realization that everything is offensive to somebody. Even what might be considered a great piece of work by most could be considered an abomination by some.  In the end a library should not be given the right to censor anything. The things that should be censored are a very small percentage and it is not worth the risk. Books that are offensive to some serve as inspiration to others. Libraries were made to give people the chance to be inspired; they are cornerstones of free thought. The library should not have the right to take inspiration away from the reader's hand, as the potential for abuse outweighs the benefits of removing a few offensive items.
1763	4740	2	3	What I Think? A very big battle for a lot of people is if libraries should allow offensive material to be on their shelves. Some people don't care, but some people think it's a very big issue. For the people who care, their view on the issue is that the offensive material should be taken off of the library shelf. I personally believe that it should be ok for 'offensive' material to be on the shelves of the libraries across the country. What is considered offensive? Each and every person has their own view on what they think is offensive. An example is a young child might think that the word 'stupid' is a curse word while some older people think that it is not a curse word. If we did take off all the offensive material from the libraries, there would be nothing left. You might think that the Bible is a very good book, but if you talk to someone who believes the Bible is false, they might think that by having the Bible of the shelf is offensive to their own beliefs. Because so many people have a different view on what is offensive, no one will ever be able to actually have a non-offensive library. A group of people cannot be able to agree on what is or what isn't offensive.  There are a lot of websites and organizations that say what they personally think is offensive and what is not. People can go to those websites and organizations to know what they personally should check out from the library. It should not be the libraries own job to say what you can and can not check out. Each person is responsible for their own actions. If a person wants to check out a book or movie that some people think is offensive, so be it. It is a free world. Some people might not approve of their choice, but again, they have the right to read that book or listen to that music.  In conclusion I state: no one should be able to say what you can and can not have on the shelves of the library. If someone personally thinks that a movie or book is offensive, then they should not watch that movie or read that book. Really the question should not be, 'Should we remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from the library that are offensive?', the question should be, 'Should I be reading this book, watching this movie, or listening to this music?'. It is everyone's own choice to read a book or listen to a CD. We are not accountable for what other people do. It is not the libraries own responsibility to be a mother to all of it's customers. Let the libraries be, offering a wide range of materials and allowing individuals to make their own informed choices.
1764	4741	2	3	"I believe that offensive books should be taken off the shelf. Some books are offensive and some are inappropriate. The librarian could get rid of the books, so the little kids can't get the inappropriate books. Movies that are rated ""R"" and above should be removed. Anything that has an 'A' rating should be removed; the libraries are a public place to rent and return, buy or sell, or to trade movies, books, and etc. Keeping the books that are safe for kids is important for their mental health. Anything inappropriate could be censored by a black marker. The old library I used to go to had all the slang, curse-words, etc., all marked out with a black Sharpie. Some of the movies were thrown out, from the rating ""PG-13"" to all the above; the magazines had marks on the pages also, censoring the slang in the magazine. The music at the library was blocked; some music was not blocked, and the rest were the censored parts of the songs. The libraries should do the same like the old one did, to protect children from harmful content."
1765	4742	2	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1 @CAPS2 my name is @PERSON1 and I am a student that attends @ORGANIZATION1. I go to libraries quite often, and things that I see in there I feel shouldn't be in there, like the movies. They're okay, but they're all sitting together. So that means me being a young lady, I see things that I know my mother wouldn't approve of me even looking at. They have censored movies just sitting there. I even go through the shelves sometimes and see the type of books that my mother wouldn't even look at. They have censored books in the libraries just sitting there like it's a book about @CAPS3 or something common. I have conversations with some of the workers sometimes, and they don't see anything wrong with little kids or teenagers looking at censored things. Not all of them think that way though. I don't think or feel that there should be censored books in the library and children are able to look at them. That's not right at all.  Far as the music, I agree with music at libraries, because many people listen to different types of music. As long as the music is something positive, but there are all kinds. You just have to be careful what music you listen to at a library because there are young people everywhere. There are children around the age of @NUM1 in there, and younger too. They wouldn't know how to respond to a song that's talking about killing people or shooting them somewhere. Then you never know what their parents wanted them to know at a young age like that. I don't feel that real nasty and bad music should be played at @CAPS4 Libraries.  I don't believe censored magazines should be in there either. I really believe that magazines are one the main censored things in the library. There are many of them books also. They shouldn't be there at all just for the sake of the children and parents. They don't need to grow up fast; they need to enjoy their life while they are young. And by looking at the censored things, that's not helping at all.  In conclusion, I really think something needs to be done about all of these censored things. Many people complain to the @CAPS1 when they come in the @CAPS4 Libraries. What I'm just asking you for is that you please help our @CAPS4 Libraries get those nasty things out of there. They can even make their own side of the Libraries with just censored things for adults only. I know that this is the right thing, and I know many people agree with me. People only want the best for their children, and a library with a lot of censored things in there doesn't sound like the best. That just means they are starting off wrong. Sincerely: A student who believes in changes
1766	4743	2	3	Everyone has a preference in works of literature, such as books, magazines, movies or music. Different types of these works of literature are significant to each person. If everyone had the right to completely remove one piece of work that displeases them, then no works would remain. Therefore, I believe no materials such as books, music, movies and magazines should be removed from public libraries or other public places. Everyone has unique ideas, necesities and preferences. A few years ago, I had a classmate who had different ideas from a myriad of people on religious persecution. He hated the idea of mixing people of different religions into one place. He wrote a paper containing all of his ideas on how the world should function in terms of religion. He tried to publish it, but did not succeed because his work was considered offensive. Even though I disagree with his ideas, I do not think his work should have been rejected. There could have been people in the world who did agree with his thoughts and would have been interested to read them. There could even have been ideas in his paper that could've helped countries solve various problems. I believe it is unfair that his paper was rejected. People have different necesities based on what they have to accomplish. For example, I was reading a book last week about a girl who was doing a project on racism. She went to the library to search for a book about apartheid in South Africa but couldn't find anything. She asked a librarian if there were any, but the librarian told her that books such as those were considered offensive in that local library and she would have to search elsewhere. I believe that it is unjust because the girl might not have had anywhere else to go to get the information about her project. She should've had the right to access the information that she needed for the project to prevent her from failing. Another reason that no books should be removed is simply because everyone has unique preferences. In the world, there are books that certain people would enjoy more than others. Literature should be abled to be used for the purpose of entertainment and convenience. If I were to go to a library now, I would find many selections that correspond to my ideal novel or magazine. Every person should have that right. If people start removing materials that are offensive to them, then nothing on the shelves would remain and not one person would have the right to have access to the materials they desire. In this world, diversity exists everywhere. People have and always will want, need and desire different things. Works of literature are just one of them. If people begin to eliminate offensive materials based on everyone's frustration or displeasures, then no books will remain on the public shelves. Therefore, materials such as books, music, movies and magazines should never be removed from public places, ensuring that diverse perspectives and information remain accessible to all. These things are necessities to the world.
1767	4744	2	3	I THINK THAT IF A BOOK IS FOUND OFFINSIVE THEN YOU SHOULDN'T READ IT. Cause what if someone else likes the book, they have the right to read that book. Maybe it's an inspiration to them, maybe it will drive them to accomplish something they want in thier life. When someone walks into a library no one can tell them what to get they make that decision themselves, so when a book offends you maybe you should wright to the auther and talk to him\her about their book. Things you could accomplish by wrighting the author is a letter in the mail stateing that he or she is sorry for hurting you with their book, another is maybe a visit from the author in person to tell you that he or she is sorry for the pain that he or she book brought you. That's what I think. Also no I don't think that the book/ books should be taken off the shelves cause maybe just maybe it will motivate someone else instead of putting them down. It's important to remember that books can have different effects on different people, and banning them limits potential positive impacts. THE END.
1768	4745	2	3	'Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?' @CAPS1 these items should be taken off the shelves if found offensive. First off, they should be removed because some people @MONTH1 be offended by them. Some @MONTH1 talk about race, religion or gender. Nobody wants to be criticized in a book or such. For example: rap music, all that is, is just people taking about what color they are or how big or small they are. Some people @MONTH1 be offended, and im sure no parent wants their child to be listening to that nonsense. So take them off the radio. Second off, if a child gets ahold of a criticizing book or movie or such that item can have a bad affect in the later future. They could start criticizing people for being different. Some books talk about religion, some people just cannot help their religion, they were born that way so they are familiar with it and do not want to change. No one should be judged for their religion, so take them off the shelves. Thirdly, my friend was watching a movie and it was about a female that liked the same sex, and in that movie they were making fun of her. No one should be judged by which sex they like. She was very offended. So take them off the shelves. Second to last, magazine authors take pictures of celebrities and down size them about three sizes smaller than what they really are and put them on the cover of fashion magazines or such. Why not just put that celebrity on there as the size they really are? Some @MONTH1 take offense to that. So just take pictures of celebrity and put them on the magazine as their real size or take them off the shelves. In conclusion, in some of my observations and reading some people get offended quite often for being a different race, gender, or religion. So I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive. @CAPS1 I strongly believe that. First off, items should be removed because some people @MONTH1 be offended by them. Some items @MONTH1 talk about race, religion, or gender in a negative light. Nobody wants to be criticized in a book or such, especially for things they cannot change. For example: rap music, some of it is just people talking about what color they are or how big or small they are in a boastful or demeaning way. Some people @MONTH1 be offended, and I'm sure no parent wants their child to be listening to that nonsense, as it can promote harmful stereotypes and unhealthy comparisons. So, take them off the radio. Second off, if a child gets ahold of a criticizing book or movie or such, that item can have a bad affect in the later future. They could start criticizing people for being different, perpetuating prejudice and intolerance. Some books talk about religion in a way that is disrespectful or inaccurate; some people just cannot help their religion, they were born that way so they are familiar with it and do not want to change. No one should be judged for their religion, especially by children who are still learning about the world, so take them off the shelves. Thirdly, my friend was watching a movie and it was about a female that liked the same sex, and in that movie they were making fun of her for her sexual orientation. No one should be judged by which sex they like; love is love. She was very offended by the way the movie mocked her identity. So take them off the shelves to prevent further harm. Second to last, magazine authors take pictures of celebrities and downsize them about three sizes smaller than what they really are and put them on the cover of fashion magazines or such. Why not just put that celebrity on there as the size they really are? Some @MONTH1 take offense to that unrealistic portrayal of beauty, as it promotes body image issues and unrealistic expectations. So just take pictures of celebrity and put them on the magazine as their real size, or take them off the shelves altogether to prevent further perpetuation of harmful beauty standards. In conclusion, in some of my observations and reading, some people get offended quite often for being a different race, gender, or religion, and these offenses can have lasting negative impacts. So I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive, to protect individuals and promote a more inclusive and respectful society.
1769	4746	2	3	Do you think libraries should have the right to take books and movies off the shelves if they find it offensive? In my opinon I do not agree and I think they should not be able to take them off the shelves. Many people have different thoughts and opinons and I am going to state mine in the next few paragraphs. To begin with, not everybody likes to read or watch the same types of books or movies. Some like romantic, scary, mysterious and there are many more selections. For instincts if one person reads something that they do not agree with, that does not mean the next person to read it is not going to like it either. Sometimes I enjoy reading books where people get hurt and sometimes killed but someone else reads it,they might think that it is horrible and very offensive. Another reason is, someone I go to the library I expect to get the book that I want to read not what others like. One time I went to the library and I was looking for a romantic book to read and I could not find it. So I went up and asked the lady at the counter and she said they do not have it anymore,and I asked why and she told me a lady found it wrong for children to be reading. In my opinon, maybe that lady did not even like romantic books.They should not just off of what one person believes. The next reason is, the library put the movie or book on the shelf in the first place because they thought people would enjoy it. The writer or producer would not be very happy if he found out that his/her movie or book got taken out of the library because they found it offensive. Just give the book a chance and see how everybody likes it. I understand if everybody thought it was really offensive to take it off but not just one person. To end with, my belief is that if they had the book in their library at one time it should just stay in there till it gets old and falls apart. The library is open to any and every type of books,not just boring ones. So I believe the books should not get taken off the sheleves they should just stay right were their suppose to be.If they do not like the book or movie then suggest to other peoples family not to read it or have them read it and see their reaction. Ultimately, keeping diverse materials available allows for individual choice and prevents the imposition of one person's values on everyone else.
1770	4747	2	3	When you walk into the heavenly sanctuary that is our library, you have opened yourself up to a vast wealth of knowledge that is available to you at the click of a mouse, the push of a button, or the turn of a page. There are those of a select few, however, who are under the paradigm that not all of this information is for all eyes. They feel it should be locked away, as if it were some eyesore. Allow me to address this view with retaliation and distaste on a number of levels in the following document. I am a musician. Music is my passion. My creative gears are forever turning. Often I look to other artists' works for inspiration, and the one place to get that music is, you guessed it, the library. How disappointed am I when I find that the music I want has been removed for being explicit. It was not the lyrics or foul message I sought, but the beautiful melodies and harmonies therein! It does not do well to isolate media without first seeing the good that lies in it and the strong feelings it has to convey. We now discard the world's greatest novel because of racial discrepancies or wizardry. We now throw away a moving song because of its lyrics. We now trash a movie after only reading the title, never even giving it a chance. How fair is this? Even now there will be those who refuse to read your newspaper because of their disagreements with one, individual editor. That is no fair crop in my right mind. I implore you, as a public, as people of sound mind and stout hearts to reconsider the censorship of those works which have a clear and true message and were forged for the benefit of our humankind. All things have a story to tell. A friend of mine once said to me, that there were three ways we could absorb things that we find undesirable. We can reject, we can ignore, or we can absorb and interpret. To reject leaves you no smarter. To ignore leaves you in fear. However, to absorb, you gain new knowledge, be it of a new culture or new person. Everything must be taken with a grain of salt. Let us watch something we find immoral and then take the time to understand why it is immoral, for it is these things that define us. If you do not see what is or is not right, who is to say what is truly ethical? We need material of substance in our libraries, for our exposure and for our fathoming of new knowledge in our modern world; by embracing diverse perspectives, even those that challenge our values, we cultivate critical thinking and foster a more informed and empathetic society.
1771	4748	2	3	No, materials should not be removed from the libraries. First most of books, movies, and music are the best way to support different things. They all have their type of way of convincing you. There are many different ways to understand but those are certainly the best ways. Like a movie some people like to see things to understand them because it takes time for some people to see instead of reading or listening. It takes people to just sit and watch which is a great way. Some people that look at a movie in a wrong way get the wrong type of thought about something which makes it offensive to them. Like music is a great way to understand what someone is trying to say or get across. You have to take time out to really listen and hear what they are talking about. If you hear a song once and then you just take it a wrong way you never let your mind hear what they said. Some people let one word or two make you think different about the song, so before you judge listen to the whole song. A book is one of the world's best ways to understand where someone is coming from. A book is like a short life. If you judge a book by its first couple paragraphs you would never get a meaning out of it. With a book you have to give it a chance to sink in your mind so that you do get an understanding. A book can tell you a lot of things, so some people take it offensively. These types of materials should never be removed from libraries. These things are great ways to understand things, so if you take one thing offensively try another way; maybe it's a better way for people to understand it. Without these materials, we would never understand or discover anything in our world, and limiting access to these resources would be detrimental to intellectual growth and understanding.
1772	4749	2	3	When you think of a book do you think happy kids books, or mysterious dark books? What if I was to say offensive books? Most magazines, music, books, and movies you take off the shelf today are not so happy or mysterious that you might think. When I think of a movie I want to watch I think of something that I'm going to enjoy; not something I'm going to shut off in the middle of it. What if you pick a movie that might look good from the front cover and you read the back and it sounds good but when you get home to watch it with your little sister or brother its the exact opposite. Do you turn it in? Do you turn it off and waste your money not doing anything about it? Offensive books, movies, music, and magazines should be cleared from the store. If you're not going to finish it, then why is it there? I'm not going to watch or read a book if it's not going to make me feel good as a person or make myself feel good. If people can sit there and write it, act it or play it then we should be able to speak our opinion on it if it's good or not. People have feelings, if they're going to be hurt by something we should enjoy then take them off the shelves. Do something about it. We all should have the success for doing something for other people, and if not that then for ourselves. Therefore, taking action to remove offensive material can benefit both individuals and society as a whole.
1773	4750	2	3	There should not be censorship on the books in the library; just think of how many great pieces of literature out there that no one would be able to get their hands on because they didn't reach your standards. People wouldn't be able to read some of their favorite books, losing access to stories and ideas that are important to them. Would you really want to take that from the people, limiting their exposure to diverse perspectives? If my argument didn't change your mind, you could at least put the censored books behind the counter, making them available upon request rather than outright banning them, thus offering a compromise.
1774	4751	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves at a library if they could be found offensive. It is good to be unique, and no matter how inappropriate a subject might be, it is still factual and helpful in learning. If anything they should just put a label on the cover of the book that says something along the lines of 'adult content.' Censorship repeats itself, and this quote reminds me of periods in history where we need to learn from our mistakes, no matter how bad the subjects are, such as the Holocaust, and the Jim Crow segregation in the deep south. What about the Holocaust, when 6 million Jews were killed because they were Jewish. People might find these books offensive but that doesn't mean the Holocaust never happened. There are many offensive and controversial pictures and stories about events that happened during the Holocaust. Even though this is a very depressing and horrific subject, it is still good for our youth to learn about what happened. And other categories need to be read because it can help youth to understand right from wrong, and help prevent them from making big mistakes in the future. The Jim Crow segregation started from the 1870's all the way until the Civil Rights Movement 1950’s. The Jim Crow segregation took a toll on everyone in the United States, but some people couldn't handle it as well as others. In the south, most white people treated African Americans as dirt. They didn't let them in their schools, in their clubs or churches, they were rude towards them, and most horrific of all, they lynched them. There were a set of laws called the 'Black Codes,' which pretty much was a list of laws to treat blacks as unfairly as possible. If a kid were to pick up a book or magazine with pictures of lynchings in them, they would remember it their whole life, and if that one picture truly bothered them, they their whole life growing up, they would realize that what white people did to blacks was unethical. Some books and magazines in libraries are really explicit, but we can't shelter our youth their whole lives. Parents need to sit down with their youth when they have questions and discuss the truth with them. What are parents going to do when their youth go to school and hear other youth talk about subjects such as sex? Youth could get the wrong idea about sex or not know exactly what it is because their parents never actually sat down and explained to them what sex is. I am not saying to go let your 3 year old look at pictures of people having sex by any means, but when youth get to a certain age, their parents need to step up and talk to them about uncomfortable subjects such as puberty, sex, and babies. It is time parents stop hiding the truth from their youth, or hovering over their shoulders like helicopters. If youth don't learn the truth about the real world and about how many evil and manipulative people there are in the world, when they go to college they won't be able to stand for themselves. If youth don't learn about history and what all has been done, it is kind of like we are treating the books like the Jews and the African Americans were treated. Just because these books are different than others we will just get rid of them, just like how we tried to kill off all the Jews and blacks because they were different. And it is wrong and inhumane. Therefore, these materials should remain available, empowering readers to learn, understand, and grow from diverse perspectives and historical realities.
1775	4752	2	3	Censorship in libraries is when a librarian has the right to remove certain materials, such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., from the shelves of a library, if the item is inappropriate. I believe that libraries should not have censorship.  I personally, think that it should be up to the library if they could have that power. If it is a library were there's always smaller children their, then I think they could have the power of censorship. In conclusion, it should be the parents of the smaller children's responsibility to make sure their child's book is appropriate for there son or daughter. This ensures that the content aligns with their values and beliefs.  Now, say if it was just a normal library with both a mixture of both grown-ups and children, then I would say there still is no need at all for a censorship. First in for most, because its your choice of the item, if you think it is offensive then simply do not read it, watch it or listen to it. Individuals should be able to make their own decisions about what they consume.  Second of all, it wouldn't be fair to the people in the library who liked a certain item, but could no longer use that item just because one person thought it was offensive. Also people would just start saying they thought that item was not suited for the library just because they did not like it period. This could lead to a slippery slope where personal preferences dictate what is available to the entire community.  Last of all, members of the library would have the same right as the librarians. So many of all the members have such different feelings on items, that so many different items would be taken off the shelf, that by the end there would be no books left. A diverse collection caters to a diverse readership, and removing items based on individual objections would severely limit access to information and different perspectives.  In conclusion, personally I do not think censorship is necessary in libraries. It would not be needed because smaller children's parents should be responsible enough check the child's items, and also because there would be so much conflict with what items were taken of the shelf and how many items were taken off the shelf. There for, I believe censorship is not need in libraries, as it would ultimately undermine the library's mission to provide access to a wide range of resources and viewpoints.
1776	4753	2	3	"I know that some people find some books offensive, mean, cruel, or racist, but most of the time people write because it's what they feel or what people want to read. Books are a privilege, and we should be able to use that privilege. People need to learn that it's okay that books sometimes are a little harsh. The real world is not the most friendly place ever, and books can help convey that with less hurt than experiencing harsh realities firsthand. I know that not all books should be removed from the shelves, because just because it's offensive to someone doesn't mean that you should take it off. For every book, someone will find something offensive because of something. If the cause is if it's offensive, then all books should be gone. If someone took the time to go out and write a book and make sure that everything about it is correct, then why should we stop them from letting people read it? They have a right to write it, and we have a right to read it, and no one should take that right away. If someone wrote a book on the Holocaust, people are very offended by that, but they don't try to get rid of it. So why should any book be different because it's not a big event like war, death, or a natural disaster. It just seems so absurd that people would go to such lengths to get rid of a book just because they are offended by it. I think they just need to suck it up and move on. If they don't like it, then don't read it. Someone who wants to can, so do not take that away from the people that want to read it. I remember a time when someone wanted to read a book in our library, and they said, ""Oh, you can't read that because it was found to be offensive."" It made me uphold that they would decide how someone else feels about a book. It makes me so angry that they get to decide how someone else feels about a book. They must be magic because I did not know that they know how someone else feels about a book or anything for that matter. We do have books here that are kept behind the librarian's desk that if you really wanted to read that book, it's behind her desk, and I'm okay with that, because at least they have it for people to read if they really wanted to. This is what I think should happen if they have books that they think are too offensive to people. At least try to give an effort to preserve our right as citizens of the United States. Let's throw another aspect here about money. The book that you want so badly gone from a library was most likely paid for by you, the taxpayer. So, you and a lot of others paid for this book, and now you want to waste that money. That is just insane that you would want to waste that money after it being paid for. This just makes me want to say, wow, do you really want to be that upset about a book? Does it make you feel better that you got all worked up over a book, and now it's gone? Well, good for you, mission accomplished. All you did was get worked up, and you wasted money. People just need to realize the bigger picture, not just themselves but others. In them taking down a book because you were offended, offends me. This offends me a large amount because now you ruined something that was not necessary to be taken down. This is how I feel about this subject. I am very upset that people would do this and go to such lengths to ban a book away from a library. If you wrote a book, and people did this to you, how would you feel? I know that you would feel like dirt that someone would do this to your hard work. People need to just calm down and smell the roses and forget about things that do not matter. Stand back and think for a second and say, ""Will this really affect me if I get this book taken off the shelf?"" It also makes me mad that the library bought the book, and now it's gone, so did the money just go to waste because the book is just gone. This is how I feel on the matter of getting rid of books, and I hope that those who seek to ban books consider the broader implications of their actions and respect the rights and perspectives of others."
1777	4754	2	3	Do citizens have the right to remove books, magazines, and other materials from shelves because they personally do not agree with the content? Censorship in libraries is a subject with an unclear answer. Some believe it is in their right to get rid of books, music, and movies with what they believe is 'offensive' material. Others think library censorship is wrong, that people should have access to whatever material they please. Censorship is simply a way of preventing knowledge from those who wish to learn more about worlds outside their own. In 2024's society, there are no limits. The human imagination can create beautiful works of literary art and music, but it can also create material not suitable for every age group. Library censorship is a way to keep this 'unsuitable' material away from young and curious eyes. However, what may be unacceptable for children to view may be perfectly fine for a mature adult. Censorship is purely opinion. If a person is a strict believer that God created the world in seven days, they might find it offensive to see a book or a movie that supports the theory of evolution. If a parent does not want their child to watch PG-13 movies, they would rather their children not see a PG-13 disk in the children's section for their child to see. If one person harbors a profound grudge against Democrats, it is unfair to others if all Democratic content is removed from a library's shelves. If a person does not wish to have access to certain 'offensive' subjects, then they do not have to expose themselves to it. But it is not in their rights to remove it from the view of others who may wish to educate themselves on the said matters. Writing is a form of self- expression, a method by which to convey feelings and thoughts and share them with others. It is also a way to teach and to inform others about the past. But if what is written is not shared, how can one form their own opinions and thoughts when they are not exposed to the opinions of those outside their community? It is unfair to prevent someone from learning about a certain subject simply because one or two other people oppose the content. If books and movies containing information unacceptable to one person were removed, then everyone else has the right to have material of their choice removed as well. Eventually, there would be nothing left because everyone is offended by one thing or another. That is one of the beauties of being an American citizen: freedom of speech. By living in the United States, one has the right to read or learn about whatever they please. Censorship prevents learning from those who want it. Parents are possibly some of the biggest advocates of library censorship. Not wanting their children to be exposed to explicit or graphic material is understandable. But just because they do not want their child to see a movie about devil worship or the Vietnam era does not mean the parent has the right to prevent all others from seeing it. Children need to be exposed to these kinds of things at some point to encourage open- mindedness and acceptance of others. Libraries provide a source by which young people can educate themselves on the religions, beliefs, and customs of the outside world. It should not be up to the parents to decide what is put on the library shelves; if they do not want their children to have access to certain subjects, do not allow them to go to the library. In conclusion, one can say library censorship is a matter of opinion. Citizens have a right to read, listen to, or watch whatever material they please. Granted, it is acceptable for parents to shield their children from certain subjects, but it is unacceptable for those same parents to prevent others in the community from learning. Freedom to express one's opinions in the form of literature means nothing if that literature cannot be shared with others. As Katherine Paterson once said, '... And then we have no bookes left of the shelf for any of us.
1778	4755	2	3	Why do we have books out there that are viewed as offensive? If they are inappropriate, why do we keep putting those books, magazines, movies, and the big one, music out there in the world? Let me tell you why, because people in @LOCATION1 America, unfortunately, have grown out of @CAPS1 after-duty time. @PERSON1 Walt Disney, @CAPS2 PG, @CAPS3 G, and many other nonoffensive shows. But with the shows, books, and movies played today are very inappropriate to the younger viewers. @DATE1 Back in the 90's @TIME1 afternoon cartoons are over, at least the good cartoons like @CAPS4 Looney Tunes and @PERSON3 Bugs Bunny, @ORGANIZATION1 Cartoon Network, @CAPS5 Nickelodeon, ect, these cartoons, that I used to watch, that taught me how to be @CAPS6 kind, @CAPS7 respectful, and @CAPS8 caring have faded away. With the cartoons out now that are supposed to be good for children, all show @CAPS22 teach the same thing and that @CAPS22 it's okay to @CAPS9 lie, @CAPS10 cheat, @CAPS11 steal, and all the other @NUM1 seven deadly sins. They show these without explaining anything that can help the child in life, and that @CAPS22 is detrimental. We can't @CAPS23 just take books off the shelves, make directors' quit directing, rappers' quit rapping, or make the pornography stop but we can restrict it to a point. It will always be out there whether it is @CAPS22 sold by the blackmarket or the adult stores. Thankfully there are ways around letting your children watch these shows. Restrictions on the television, make the offensive books, magazines in a library to a restricted area to where no one can enter without being @NUM2 18 years old. There @CAPS22 is a lot to say about the music out there. It can be and is @CAPS22 very offensive. I was born and raised on the old fashion country music and unfortunately country music has gone to the dogs. Sorry to say but the change in music started at the beginning of the @LOCATION2 1960's @CAPS13 era, with the hippies. While they were all hopped up on @CAPS14 LSD, @CAPS15 marijuana, and @CAPS16 speed, they brought to life the new @CAPS17 rock and @CAPS18 roll. So it has been here over @NUM3 60 years it is not @CAPS23 going away. All we can do is hope our children don't @CAPS23 turn on the radio that is tuned into that crap and say '@CAPS19 hey that sound like good music.' With the pornographic magazines, they have been around since @PERSON2 Marilyn Monroe was in her prime. It is not @CAPS23 going to stop whatever we do. All we can do is block it out of our lives. We can try and keep it out of our children’s eyes but it will not @CAPS23 help, they will always be known to this world. I think we should move these things to another part of the library, that only adults can get to if that can be done in the library. Then we will move onto the music, and then the shows. Remember it will always be out there, all we can do as @CAPS20 parents is try to keep it out of reach of our children. We can't stop it but we can try and keep it out of their eyes. With the will power of @CAPS20 parents it CAN be done. FAILURE is not @CAPS23 an @CAPS24 option @CAPS25 here!!! We must proactively shield our children from harmful content to the best of our ability, recognizing that complete prevention is impossible but diligent effort can make a significant difference.
1779	4756	2	3	Libraries @CAPS1 or @CAPS2? This world is like no other world but to have some of our ideas blocked because there to offensive thats obsurd. There is a lot of things that are offensive in a library such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect... But if they are so offensive to some people then why keep complaining do somthing about tell it someone. Now librarys are a place where people can relax and grab a @CAPS1 book to read it. When they stumble upon this book that is highly offensve why put it back. Say somehthing and tell the manager this book is too offensive to be in a library. There are kids in the library maybe looking for something to read they @MONTH1 stumble upon a movie that is very inpropriate. Things like that should not be in a public library. As a @CAPS3.S citizen i belive that things like that should be removed for the shevles. Why would they be up there in the first place what is this world coming to. Some of these books now and days need to be censored. Beacuse of all the @CAPS2 words in there kids might pick up all that foul language. How about some of this music don't you think some of the lyrics maybe be offensive to some people. When rock stars, rapers, ect... write there lyrics they don't think of what other people think of them. They just might put the most badest languege in there songs they don't care they just want the money.Thats why you should put you're foot down and say this is going a little to far why not censor some of your lyrics? Why not write a letter sstating your concerns. Things in the librarys like books, movies, magazines, ect.. all should be checked and blacked out. Some of this shoudn't even be displayed in the librarys. There are children in the library now why would you go as far to put things like that in a public library. Lets take a magazine for example, a magazine has things that talk a lot about sex, drugs, and other things related to that. Some people might like it but for a twelve year old boy to pick up somthing like that and start reading it. To me thats wrong i dont know about anyone else but that shouldn't be displayed in a library. Now ive been to a library before they have some inapropriate things in there. But i really didn't think anything of it but when i seen a eleven year old boy reading about drugs, sex, and violence that's something he might pick up on. He is seeing it in a book so why not try something in a book. Now and days this world has some shocking things in it but to put things like this in a library is horrible. This is all where censership comes into play by editing a lot of the things in the library. People now and days dont care but they shoud start caring more. Thats just my opinion why i think its wrong to put all this @CAPS2 stuff in a public liberary. I think this is something kids don't need to see, and implementing censorship would make libraries more appropriate for everyone.
1780	4757	2	3	I believe that if books, music, or magazines are offensive and people don't like them, then those people should simply remove themselves from that library. There are a lot of things out there that people like to read and listen to. Maybe for those people who do not like certain items, they can go to another library; there are plenty around us. If a person didn't like what they saw at that library, then why go back? It could be offensive to some people but not all. So, if people try to fight about removing them, then the people that like them are going to be mad because they like to read it and they have a good time. Like I said before, if they do not like it, then there are plenty more libraries that probably will not have it there.  Libraries should be able to put what they want on their shelves. They could put it in the back, and whoever wants it can go ask for it. Or they could put something up to make it clear what's over there, and if you don't like it, then don't go in. There is more than just one shelf in a library; if you don't like it, then don't go over there. If there is a sign up, then there will be no reason for you to go over there and get all offended and complain about it.  You've got to think about other people in this, too. People that do like it and go to the libraries to read books, listen to music, rent a movie, read magazines—they wouldn't be able to do it anymore. Then they will be mad, and that's just another fight. Would anyone want that much drama? I wouldn't. That would be too much for me to handle. People are touchy now these days. No one will know what a person would do if they don't get their book, music, movies, or magazines. How would you feel if you lost that? Probably not too happy.  I believe that books, music, movies, and magazines should stay on the shelves of the library. Just because a few people don't like it and want to fight for it, they should really sit back and look at what they are doing. There is more than just one library in this world. If you don't like the stuff that library is putting on its shelves, then go find a new one. It's not worth fighting over and spending all that money on, especially when not a lot of people have extra money to waste these days just to fight about what is on a library shelf. It's not even worth it. Like I said before, you don't like it, don't look at it, read it, listen to it, or anything. Just stay away from it, and you will not get offended, allowing everyone to enjoy the library in peace.
1781	4758	2	3	I don't think materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves simply for being offensive; they should remain available for appropriate age groups. Adults over eighteen should have the freedom to choose content on any topic. For those under eighteen, there should be age verification and parental consent requirements. Libraries and bookstores should implement a rating system, similar to movies, to indicate content suitability. This could reduce parental concerns about children accessing inappropriate materials. Selling restricted content to minors without parental consent could result in legal consequences, similar to selling alcohol or cigarettes. I have observed firsthand how exposing children to inappropriate content can have negative consequences. For example, my mother allowed my little brother to play video games featuring violence, sex, drugs, and foul language. As a result, he is disrespectful, disobedient, and misbehaves in school. Even with parental permission, there should still be age restrictions on offensive content. Some parents make poor choices, leading to negative outcomes for their children. Therefore, my overall opinion is to keep the books on the shelf for mature individuals. By limiting the accessibility of offensive materials to minors, we can potentially reduce crime rates, violence, drug offenses, and abuse, contributing to a more positive environment for children to develop in.
1782	4759	2	3	Today in the media there are many things that can be found offensive. Movies, books, songs and magazines are a few examples of where someone might find something offensive. I believe that whatever is put into the media has a purpose. If someone thinks that something is offensive I think that they should just take what they find offensive away from themselves and not take it away from everyone else also. When a song artist comes up with a song there is a reason for why they put what they do in their songs; perhaps it reflects their personal experiences, or they are trying to make a broader statement. Sometimes they do it to get a point across to the audience. When someone finds a movie offensive there is a reason for why it is the way it is; it's to get a point across. Perhaps the director is trying to explore a difficult topic or challenge societal norms. If people find the movie offensive they just simply shouldn't subject themselves to it. If they don't watch the movie they won't have anything to be offended about. Certain books in libraries are found offensive to some people just because they don't agree with what is in them. If there is something in a book that you don't agree with you don't just take the book off the shelf and throw it away. Other people might enjoy reading that book and find value in its perspective. If the book is thrown away no one will have the chance to read it besides the person who threw it away. I do not believe that media that is found offensive to some of the public should be removed. Not everyone finds certain things offensive in the media. Again, everything that is put onto the market and into the media has a purpose; its purpose is to get a point across to others, and censorship limits the potential for understanding and dialogue.
1783	4760	2	3	Certain books, magazines, music and movies should not be put on the shelves of a library. Children can learn rude or nasty things that their parents might not find alright for their child. There are some things that can be offensive in a library like prejudice books or music. Often music uses swearing language or states certain views on politics. Libraries need to take control of this issue the right way. Getting rid of the material is not what should be done. Libraries need to keep better watch over certain sections of the library. They could do this by not letting children leave their parents side, which would allow parents to maintain control over what their children are accessing and seeing.  Then there is the issue of offending people. These problems could be resolved simply by putting up signs in different spots of the library. These signs could be in big bold letters stating 'Certain things in this section can be offending', 'Parental control needed past this point'. Libraries should be more aware of how people feel about the way they are set up and presented to the public. Libraries should put them selves in the publics shoes, to see how they would like it if some of these things were showed to their children. Also, looking at things in a point of view of how some things could be offending, to fix the problems.  Once when I was in a library I was offended by a book title that was against my religion. After seeing that I thought if their were a sign or something around to warn me I would not of had to see that. Other things like this have occured in a library like one time my brother rented a movie my parents did not approve of. But with the way the libraries are set up and controled my brother was able to rent the movie and sneak it past my parents. Other children like my brother could do the same things only worse like look at an inappropiate magazine or read certain books that parents would not approve.  These types of occurances need to stop before something really bad happens. Libraries need to take control and show they know how to present things to the public in a proper manner. Actions that are happening in todays libraries are not alright, and it's crucial to address these concerns proactively. Putting up signs and requiring parental control can reduce if not elliminate these unapproved occurances, creating a more responsible and respectful environment for all library patrons.
1784	4761	2	3	Offensive things should be taken off for many reasons that will be explained later on. Things in magazines should be appropriate for people to see. The first reason why they should be removed from the shelves is it might be offending to someone important like the president of the NAACP or the Governor of your state. If the subjects in the reading material are offensive to someone they should say something to defend themselves. If they don't speak up no one will think to change anything. What I don't understand is why people would let that ridiculous stuff be put in the magazines and music and movies anyway, even though movies are kind of different. Movies are mostly just made up ideas that people come up with, so if people are offended it is just pretend to begin with. Offending things in books, well the author probably has a reason for it. It might be something that is offending yet people need to know this in case it has to do with someone you know. For example in the Newspaper I read an article about our current president. Barack Obama was being questioned about his birth certificate. People did not believe that he was born in America. I personally think he was in fact born in the U.S. But of course they did see his certificate that proved he was a member so that mess should be dropped and forgotten. It was uncalled for to begin with. I wonder what was going through his head when someone asked him that question. I'm sure someone would have seen it before he even became president, so it's clear that offensive material, whether real or fictional, can have a damaging impact and should be carefully considered.
1785	4762	2	3	What if someone found my favorite book offensive? Inappropriate materials do need to be kept from young minds of children. On the other hand, you can't shield people from things they should know or already know. Everyone has different things that they think are offensive, so one person might think a book is so bad it should be recalled from the shelves but another person might see no problem with it. Children need to be protected from materials that might hurt them in some way. Children do what they see and hear, so they are liable to try and copy harmful things they read. Bad influences can be even magazines with famous celebrities being caught breaking the law or doing bad things and young minds see that as 'cool' and might try to follow that example. Children and young people see and hear a lot worse things at home, television and even at school than in some books. Children need to be protected but, you can't baby proof life. They will be introduced to plenty of bad influences in their lifetime but, it should be the parent's job to teach their kids to say no and stay away from bad things. Kids can learn so much worse things from something at the library by just sitting at home. Libraries are places for public use and the public covers a wide amount of different kinds of people and someone will always find something bothersome with something or another. People have different views, beliefs and religions, and, books on these might be offensive to some but, the lifestyle of another. Like The quote by Katherine Paterson, said if we take off the shelves every book or material that someone finds offensive there will be no books in the libraries at all. Yes, there are books that are not always very presentable to a certain group of people but, they should have a right to be read if there is someone who wants to read them. It is not the library’s job to be prejudiced against certain books just because someone doesn't agree with it. Books should be a wide variety like the people who are reading them. Also children are protected from books if they have learned morals that allow them to make mature choices. Therefore, while protection is needed, censorship should not dictate what is available for everyone.
1786	4763	2	3	I believe that any book or movie that is in the library is in the library for a good reason. The world is full with things that will hurt and make a person feel bad about themselves, and there are things in the world that will make you feel like you are on top of the world. Yes, there are things that children can see and what they are not supposed to see, and those things are mostly likely not exposed to the student until they are at a mature and a responsible age. Life is full of things, and as children grow up they are going to be taught and shown things that parents think are uncomfortable. Such as: Books that show people with disorders, books about romance, movies with cussing and sex scenes, violence; some parents don't even want their children to see a simple kiss on the cheek, which I find really weird because things like that are going to happen in life. On the other hand, if your child is doing things that they shouldn't be doing, then okay. Take acting. I also agree that children shouldn't be taught about sex and shown what females and males have on their bodies; their minds shouldn't even be set on that. Books, movies, and shows shouldn't be removed because they show what life is about and what is going to happen when you get older, and removing them deprives children of the opportunity to learn and understand the complexities of the world around them.
1787	4764	2	3	Debates are a main part of our society today. Everyone has an opinion on how things should be in the world, and no one is necessarily right. Books that show how other cultures behave, that to the people being described in the book may seem offensive in March, are important because we as people need to absorb as much as we can about other cultures. Our businesses are in other countries, many people living in America speak multiple languages, and people have the right to read things that may in fact be offensive to a race of people in March. Businesses thrive in other countries. A lot of our countries income is from our factories and companies in other countries. China is a place where much business happens for the company. If we, as Americans, can't learn about the Chinese, how can we learn their business methods and way of life? To the Chinese, these books may be offensive in March, but to us they are learning tools describing Chinese culture. Being bilingual is a trend that millions of people adhere to. High schools require that we learn some foreign language, even if it is only the basics. The schools do this so that we can go to other countries in the work force. Learning about their language and habits comes from books. The Mexican population might not like the way we depict them in our stories, but this is necessary to learn about them. In the United States, there are all kinds of freedoms that we as Americans use freely. Freedom of speech says that we can say whatever we want when we live in America. Books are not excluded from this rule. I'm sure that other countries have offensive books about us. It's a common theme around the globe. Businesses thrive in foreign countries, so we must be able to read some books about them, even if they seem offensive. Learning new things is something that every school teaches and there should be no limit to what we can learn. If a book has vulgar language and sexual scenes, it should be taken out of the children's section of the library, not banned completely. This is the same case with other populations of people. They cannot take offense to what we have to say, because worse has been said about them than what we can possibly put in a book. Learning is a necessary tool in our society and nothing should be restricted, as it is vital for understanding diverse cultures and promoting global progress in our interconnected world.
1788	4765	2	3	Books are very important to our society. They hold a special place in our hearts, and contain much of our world's knowledge. Everyone has their own opinion about what should or should not be placed in books. I definetly agree that little children should not purchase a book that has explicit content in it that they should not read. However, some people, myself included, have checked out or bought books and then realized what exactly was portrayed in those books. I do not believe that anything that contains certain contents should be removed from the shelves. I can think of many books that could be taken offensively that are still on many school library and public library shelves. Any books about the BLACKS and even the NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURE, such as 'HARRIET BEECHER STOWE's UNCLE TOM'S CABIN' can be taken in the wrong context. These books do contain language that is not appropriate for children. But we do still see them on our shelves. Why? Because those books, and many others, are very important to us. Books should stay on their shelves because, as Katherine Paterson cleverly put it, '... And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' That means that if everyone took out books that they felt were personally offensive then there would be no books. Books are vital to learning things. We put all of our knowledge into them, even hundreds, if not thousands, of years ago. When the libraries in ALEXANDRIA were burned and/or destroyed, we thought our knowledge was gone forever. Thank goodness for the back-up system that no one had known about out in the VATICAN. I myself have read the BIBLE. I believe it whole-heartedly, but I do know of people who do not believe in the LORD and have taken some things that are said in the BIBLE to be taken personally. I believe that the BIBLE is the most important book in the world. Without the BIBLE no one would know of the wonderful things that our LORD above has done for us, and what he is doing for us now. However, some people can take what the BIBLE says to be offensive in regards to homosexuals and divorces. But would we allow the gays or divorced men and women to take the BIBLE off of the shelves? Of course not!If we would not allow them to take off that ever so important book, then why should we allow to have other books to be removed? Books are so very important to us and our world. They hold our world's knowledge, and they also hold our hearts. Just think about what our world, our knowledge, our society would be like if we did not have these precious things. Can you imagine it? I cannot. Books are one of the most important things that we have in OUR world. Just because someone finds something offensive in a written work does not mean that everyone else will, too. Books, if they are offensive to anyone, should be kept on our shelves for our future generations to come so they MAY learn and grow on our knowledge of our past.
1789	4766	2	3	In today's world, children are exposed to a lot of inappropriate things than in recent times. They hear things from older siblings, see uncensored programs on television, hear words in music, and even learn things from books. An issue at hand is whether or not libraries should or should not dispose of inappropriate books, movies, music, and magazines. Children can read whatever they like if their parents give permission, but in today's society some parents do not take the time to care, consumed in their work. One way society can take care of this problem is setting age limits on books. There have been times when my mother will not allow me to read a book because it dealt with issues that I was not ready to learn about. Although I am lucky that my mother cares about what I read, some parents are not. This is why an age limit would be helpful in keeping our youth modest. The librarians, or a national book association, could decide if the content of a book is appropriate for a certain age. This would take care of children reading about bawdy issues that they should not know about. Also, wholesome books should be more readily available. These types of books teach good morals and how to live a good and full life. In schools across the country, many wholesome authors are not in the public school libraries. By putting these types of books into the libraries, students would be more aware of them and would most likely have an interest in them, learning from them. Another issue libraries have is music and movies. It is nice to be able to go to the library and check out a cd or even a movie. But, some of these have terrible language and scenes not appropriate for children. What can the general public do about this? Well, demand that all music and videos with content not generalized for children be removed from the libraries. This would keep children from seeing and hearing actions they should not copy. There are ratings on movies for a reason, so why not use them. Anything above PG should be a definent no in libraries. If the movie has content that any child under thirteen should not see, then the movie should be out. Magazines also offer a source of learning. Some are very educational, and give the students ideas to go and come up with a new invention or a way to help others. But, some have content that are not suited for children. Thus, like the books, the magazines should also have ratings. The magazine Cosmopolitan, for example, has articles that are to bawdy for students to read. Magazines like this should be put in an adult section where students cannot look at them. Magazines also offer pictures that, in recent times, would have been illegal to put out. But, in today's standards, they are fine to put in magazines. These magazines should not even be allowed in the libraries across our nation. America's standards on what is okay to read, look at, watch, and listen to have changed drastically. Children are learning things they should not know about, until an older age, at a very young age. Society need to put strict restrictions on what is right and what is not for children. I personally believe that there should be very strict restrictions on what children are allowed to watch, read, and listen to. My parents were very strict about this and, in the end, I feel this has benefitted my learning process. Also, I feel the libraries should rid of books that, in olden times, would have been a shame to read. Parents today are not as in sync with what their children do as they were in recent years. So, society needs to put a strict rule on what libraries carry and what they do not, ensuring a more nurturing and appropriate environment for children's development.
1790	4767	2	3	The question of whether potentially offensive material in libraries and music should be censored, or even removed, is complex. My opinion leans towards censorship in both libraries and music to a degree, but not complete removal simply because one person finds something offensive. Books that some find offensive might resonate with others, offering connection and understanding based on personal experiences.  However, caution is warranted, especially where younger audiences are concerned. We should censor to a certain extent, being mindful of impressionable minds exposed to radio or books, but avoiding overreach. Strategically limiting exposure to negative influences could potentially contribute to a safer and more positive society, by promoting good influences and perspectives.  The reason I wouldn’t advocate for wholesale censorship is the impracticality of completely preventing access. While efforts can be made, the reality is that elimination is unlikely, which is a key reason against removing materials entirely just because someone is offended. Instead, relocating offensive items to less accessible areas might be a suitable compromise.  While such actions are understandable, they would likely face backlash. Yet, government actions often face disapproval, and the same could be said here. Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers both individual sensitivities and the broader accessibility of diverse perspectives is key, even if achieving universal agreement remains elusive.
1791	4768	2	3	Books, movies, magazines, music, etc., make up a huge part of our entertainment system in our lives today. Whether it be informational or just purely for entertainment, many forms of entertainment are found in your local library today, whereas in the past most libraries only contained books. Although, our entertainment today is much different then it was back then and will be much different than it will be in the future. In today's society books, magazines, music, movies, and so on can be found in your local library, and contain many different types of material. Some material could be informational about our solar system or about the human body. Other material could be a fiction story filled with action, horror, or love. Some material could also be filled with true, life changing, and inspirational stories. Whichever it may be, these types of things may come off as offensive to some people more than others and may not be appropriate for younger ages. Certain books, movies, magazines, music, etc., containing offensive, inappropriate, or rude material shouldn't be banned from libraries, just because those younger than adults should not read them, or because those who dislike the material believe that that material does not belong in the library. Generally most libraries are quite large and organized into various sections throughout the building. One area might be for fiction books and another for non-fiction books, another area could be for children's books, and another for magazines, movies, music, etc., all based on different types and genres. Simply do this for those materials that should only be read by adults and not for children or teens. Take the books that may contain offensive material, or may be inappropriate for those younger than adults and place them in their own divided section in the library. When a book from that section is being checked out merely ask for an ID from the person checking that book out to make sure that they are of age. This can also apply to movies, magazines, music, and so on that are placed in that section. Some materials found in libraries that may be offensive to one person may not be offensive to others. Taking those offensive materials out of the library won't benefit everyone and may disappoint some of the people who don't find that material offensive. Placing these certain materials in their own section is the best way to go to benefit everyone. As you can see just because one person may find certain material in magazines, books, music, movies, etc., offensive, rude, or inappropriate, doesn't mean that everyone else does. It also doesn't mean you should completely take out and get rid of all the materials that are found to contain offensive or inappropriate material. Dividing those specific materials into their own section, and regulating who may check them out is really the best way to go. It benefits everyone at best so that those who want to read that material can still go to their library and check out that book, magazine, and so on, and those who wish to not have anything to do with that certain material don't have to worry about finding material that is offensive or inappropriate, because they will be in their own divided section, allowing the library to serve a diverse community with varied interests and sensitivities.
1792	4769	2	3	I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves due to censorship. Different sections in the library should be offered. Everyone has different opinions on what they like to read or watch, and individuals should make choices at their own risk. Censorship should not affect the library. The library should offer different sections, therefore a kids side, a teenage side, and an adult side, catering to various age groups and maturity levels. The kids side should offer books that only kids should see by age group. The kids should not have to worry about censorship because they should not be offered anything that a librarian would not want them to see and they should only be able to checkout things from their side of the library. A teen side should not have censorship because a lot of kids know many things that they should not, so it would not affect them as much. Books that teenagers read are most likely to have foul language and inappropriate things. Teenagers, when they read or see things, do not really influence them as much. Music that teenagers listen to – they already know what most of the songs are talking about, so why offer only censored music at libraries? Why would you want to try to remove something when it is already known? An adult side should not have censorship; adults should be able to read, watch, and look at mostly anything. Adults are the ones who see it and heard it all. It would be pointless to get rid of things on the shelves. They already know of a lot of things. Why get rid of books that others @MONTH1 read? It is a library, so it should just offer things that would increase intelligence, not decrease it. Censorship is pointless; you should do what you want at your own risk. Things in movies, books, and magazines are of the world. Why try to block out negative things when they are all around you? If someone finds something offensive, then let it be; there are many things offensive in today's society. You pick up what you want to read and make the choice on your own. If you are capable of reading it or if it is the right decision, check it out. You enter the library at your own risk and choose what criteria or selection you are going to choose. The library is full of different opinions and a lot of different likes and dislikes. If you should not be looking at something, then it is your opinion to take what you want out of it. Everyone enjoys different things like movies, books, magazines, and music. If the library had censorship, they would lose a lot of materials all due to opinions of people that did not care about others' opinions. Everyone enjoys different things and wants a wide variety of the things they like. The library is where you go when you need books, movies, etc. Why close someone's opinion of book selections, what if that is the only type of selection, or book they like to read? I believe that the censorship should not affect the library. The library should offer different sections for certain age groups. The books and magazines and music at the library should all be at your own risk to checkout them. Everyone has different opinions at the library. Censorship would be a bad decision if they did go through with this decision. The library would not offer as many things, and most likely, fewer things would be getting checked out. Therefore, I do think that the censorship should not remove books on the shelves at libraries, as it limits access to information and individual choice.
1793	4770	2	3	I personally think certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc.; should not have to be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. First of all how do we define offensive? Is it something that discriminates a certain group of people? Is it something that creates negative attention? Is it something we don't like? Anybody can walk in a library and find something they did not like, but that does not automatically mean it is offensive. The National Geographic magazine often has pictures of naked people and so does the Playboy magazine. So which one would we have to put censorship on? The answer is we don't put one because this would start a big argument of which is offensive and which is not. It would cause a conflict of two different sides. It is only offensive when we make it offensive. We do not have to look at something we don't like. We all have a choice and we can choose not to pick up something we might think is offensive. The Republican party might not get along with the Democrats but if both were in a library together with both of their holy books on the shelves, they cannot say one's book is offensive to another because it does not agree with theirs. We sometimes forget we have the amendment that allows us the freedom of speech and press. We might not like what one person publishes but it doesn't make their work offensive because it might be for a certain of group that likes it, which is not offensive to them. Everything in the library has a purpose and if it does not fit our purpose then there is no way it would be offensive to us. The library is a place for books, music, movies, magazines, etc.. We come to the library to check out books for a research in order to learn. We also go to the library to read the newest book of a series. Putting a censorship on these things would not enable us to do these. We can't finish our research project because someone thought one book was offensive or we can't listen to new album Dr. Dre released because some people think the lyrics are too offensive. Putting a censorship would upset the general public more than not having a censorship because if everyone can check out what they want from the library then everyone is content, suggesting that open access and personal choice are ultimately more beneficial than censorship.
1794	4771	2	3	We all hope that one day our children will not pick up a book or a magazine they're not supposed to read. Children don't know any better. But why should we have to have movies, books and etc censored, cause there are little children everywhere? If I had the right to keep the books and etc. on the shelf, I would. I think that we should be able to have books that are uncensored on the shelves. If everything was censored, we would really have nothing to read or to watch. Having everything censored is just not fair to the world. Everyone should be able to watch whatever they want without it having to be censored. If people's favorite movies or music were censored, it probably wouldn't be that funny to them anymore; they'll most likely just stop watching it.  I don't believe that they should have censorship in libraries. Certain materials, like CDs or songs, do come off a little offensive sometimes, but that's just life. If you think it's offensive, then just don't listen to it. That doesn't mean that they have to take it off the shelf. Maybe other people like that kind of music or etc. That doesn't mean they have a right just to take it off because of that; if they did, that's just really unfair.  Children nowadays see more and know more what they are not supposed to know, for an example, cursing. If a child happened to see cursing in a magazine at the library and their parents got mad that was in the magazine, the parent shouldn't really be mad and take that offensive, and think that is not supposed to be in there. The library shouldn't have to censor things because of that incident. The children will hear it or see it again sooner or later. It's a part of the world.  I would keep the right for the libraries to have things uncensored if I had the decision. These are some ideas why I think they shouldn't have to censor movies, music, etc. in the library; ultimately, access to diverse materials is crucial for a well-informed and open society.
1795	4772	2	3	Libraries have a variety of material from books to movies. Most of this is intended for a general audience and many people can read or watch whatever they want. Some of the literature and other material you @MONTH1 find in libraries however, are not intended for certain people, such as young children, which is why parental guidance is often suggested. Censorship takes material that these certian people should not read away from everyone. Many people want censorship not just in libraries but in many aspects of life, thinking it protects vulnerable groups. Censorship is not bad per say but it does restrict people, who would normally have access to a certain topic, to a general catigory. Not everyone likes to read the same thing as someone else. Other then likes and dislikes is the problem of offensiveness. Everyone finds something offensive, demonstrating the subjective nature of taste. Just because you find something that speaks a bold statement does not mean that you should persicute someone who is intersested in the subject matter. For the matter of protecting children against something they should not read yet is simple. Libraries often have dedicated children's sections where children @MONTH1 choose material approprate for their age range. More often then not I enjoy reading what I enjoy far more than something that is forced. Censorship takes away from the enjoyment of reading. By not having censorship, everyone will be happy in the fact that they get to read what they like. This also allows a variety of books to a variety of people, fostering intellectual curiosity and personal growth through diverse perspectives.
1796	4773	2	3	The author is writing about taking books off the shelves that adults don't want, and the fear that in the end, there won't be any books left. They take out the books that have bad words or pictures in them. Well, I don't really believe that they should take them out because they get interesting, well some of them do. Well, I'm not a fan of reading, I don't really like reading, but I have to anyway, and I don't think they should be taken out. I don't really think they should be taken out for some reasons; it's better to have them so kids can read and learn about the pictures. Some books aren't that bad; little kids, like elementary kids, the only books they like are the ones with pictures in them. The high school and middle school kids like the chapter kind of books and interesting books. The parents would like them to have educational books that will help the kids learn new words and school-related stuff. The books the adults want are the kind that have meaning, like having a lot of knowledge and school-related stuff. They want their kids to learn about what they are reading. But yeah, I don't think they should take out the books that they have; they should just leave them for the kids because they're at least educational to them. So the adults would have more educated students to rely on, showing that keeping a variety of books is beneficial for the students' overall development.
1797	4774	2	3	I do not think that materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. I think this because people have different views and beliefs on certain types of things, with religion, culture, and sexuality. Some people can be offended by it but others might be informed and learn new facts that they didn't already know. People are not going to look at things the same. Everyone has their own way of life and thinks differently. If one person feels the book was offensive to them then they would take it off the shelves. One by one people would find other materials offensive and what does it leave us? No more books, music, movies, and magazines. Let's face it, everyone has different beliefs, values, and purposes but taking materials off the shelves because they found it offensive is ridiculous to me. I say if they find it offensive don't read the book again or the magazine again. Feel offended over a movie don't watch it again and the same as music don't listen to it again. Easy as that. Materials give us resources and we learn new things. If we didn't have materials like books, music, movies, and magazines we wouldn't be as smart as we are. America is about being free and having the right to speak our mind. So, removing materials from shelves is not the answer. Ultimately, individual choice and access to diverse resources are far more valuable than shielding ourselves from potentially offensive content.
1798	4775	2	3	Yes we should keep the books, music, movies, and magazines. The magazines and music might not be a good thing for some, but for most people use music to concentrate on doing work, and magazines help us on getting topics for class work. Furthermore, books offer a wealth of knowledge and movies can provide valuable cultural insights. Why would someone take books or anything that help us in life, so the person who wants to take books away should leave the books or anything else alone. So to this yes we should keep the books, music, movies, and magazines on the shelves. We need to start fighting for what we want and how we want it; it should not be anyone else's choice to decide what is good for us, as these resources contribute significantly to our learning and overall well-being, and we should defend our right to access them.
1799	4776	2	3	I do believe that books, magazines, music, movies and etc., should be taken off a shelf if a person wants to read the book or magazine. If another person wants to read the book or magazine they would just have to wait until the book or magazine is returned to the shelf. If another person wants to listen to music or watch a movie they should also do the same. Sometimes you just have to sit and think what is books, magazines, movies, music and etc., for and why are they on the shelves for if you can't read, listen or watch them. Book and magazine should be read and not just sit and be displayed. Music should be listen to and movies should be watched. The reason why I agree with the fact magazines and book should be taking off the shelf is because they were made to entertain you. A book or magazine is also made to catch the reader attention. Another reason why I think books or magazines should be removed from a shelf is to learn new things. An example of learning new things is when you go to school you pick up the classroom book you learn different thing like math, you learn about the history, or you learn about different thing in english class. Magazines and books were made so that different people can take it off a shelf and look though it even if they only want to look a pictures if it has picture. The reason why I think music should be taking off the shelf is to listen to different music such as rap, R&B, gospel, or rock and soul. Also, I think music should be removed from the shelf is because it was meant to heard. Some music can teach you what goes on in a person life or what goes on in their heads. Music can inspire people in different ways. Music is apart of life and most people in the world like to listen it different people that inspir them. The reason why I think movies should be taking off the shelf is because it is meant to be watched not just sit and let in movie cover entertain the people. Movies can also inspire different people to do different thing, such as become an actor also. Movies tell different stories such as life stories. Movies also give people something to do when they are bored. To conclude this all up, take movies, magazines, books and music off the shelf but put them back so that other people can enjoy they thing you read, watched, or listened to. Watching movies and listening to music and reading magazines and books can help people in life and also inspire people. They were made for very good reasons so don't put them up just to be displayed. Take them and use them for good you want regret it in the long run. Ya'll be suprised what different things you can learn by reading, listening and watching, and you might even find new passions or perspectives along the way.
1800	4777	2	3	"Different Then Everyone Else @CAPS1 do people find small things offensive? My opinion is that everyone has their own idea of what can be offensive to them. There are so many small things that can be offensive like books, movies, and music. It's not horrible or bad to have a book on the shelf that you might think is offensive. I find it a little rude to discriminate someone for their one belonging. Books can be a way to learn new things about someone. I think sometimes books can tell you more than what a person with their own words can. There are so many books that can be a little offensive to people and even kids. I know that a parent wouldn't like to have a book on the shelf about ""@CAPS2,"" when they are getting @CAPS2. Sure it is not a nice thing to read about but, really parents think about it. Don't you think us like kids need to know what really means @CAPS2? A book can tell us the and a good way or and a bad way but we can learned from it, and you don't even have to talk about it. Movies are similar like books, in one way you can see it in action what there trying to teach everyone. I know that some movies are horrible just like @CAPS3 @CAPS4. It's a horrible movie to watch but really we need to know what really happened to those people. And even if a teacher is tell you have to see it with your own eyes to believe it. A good way is to watch the movie and learned from it. Music has a lot of ways of being offensive to people but singer's that's their way of express their own feeling about stuff. We can't really discriminate anyone for their own believes. There are so many singer like @CAPS5 @CAPS6, that use a lot of bad words in his song but that's how he get's his own feeling out to others. Even if the song is offensive to you it's more of their own opinion just like we all have different opinion then others. My opinion about feeling offensive is we all are different and have a opinion about it and we need to respect the. Especially if i wanted to learned new things and someone doesn't want to tell me or show me I would want a book or a movie to learned. And parents just becuase I'm reading a book, or watching a movie or listening to music about bad stuff don't assume I'm going to do those things I would just want to learned about it. I wouldn't like for someone to take a book off the shelf especially if i want to read it. Remember it's your own opinion about the book not everyone is different then you. Ultimately, understanding and respecting differing viewpoints is crucial to fostering a more tolerant and informed society."
