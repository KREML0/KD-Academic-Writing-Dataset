This is why the author stressed how thankful he was that his family had come to America to make him a better life and that his friends came over to share their culture. Also the author was saying that even in America it was important to remember his cuban blood and culture. This is why he says ""...and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful).

12	11838	5	3	The mood in the memoir that the author creates is a very warm and relaxed sort of mood. The way the author tells you about his parents; the selflessness and the way they put their kids first before themselves really just makes you think about your own parents and how good they are to you and what they would do for you. The way the author talks about his home makes you think of all the colors in the house. I think that the house would be a golden-red color—yellow, white, brown, and orange—on the insides. It reminds me of the way they would have cooked, probably with fresh ingredients. They would have cooked with colorful peppers, onions, tortillas, and oils. It makes you think about what colors you have in your home and what you would cook with. The music sounds wonderful. Even though they don't demonstrate what it actually sounds like, you can easily imagine it filling the space. I imagine it laying in the background while all the adults are cooking and the kids are playing in colorful rooms with the golden sunlight shining in through an open window. I love the mood that this memoir puts me in, creating a sense of peace and nostalgia.
13	11839	5	3	The mood of the memoir is very upbeat, happy mood of how @PERSON1 grew up in Newark, New Jersey in a very Cuban family and tells the story of how Narciso went through his childhood. This memoir really emphasizes the connection and love that Narciso had with his parents and his home, highlighting the warmth and closeness of his family life. It kind of makes you think that there is more to a house than just walls and a ceiling and that maybe it's part of a family, holding memories and fostering deep bonds.
14	11840	5	3	The author's mood in the memoir seems tinged with a sense of displacement due to frequent moves during her childhood, a period marked by instability. Even at twenty-seven, Narciso Rodriguez living in a one-apartment room with her family further suggests a feeling of being unsettled. The presence of racism during her upbringing likely contributed to a challenging environment. However, there's also a sense of warmth stemming from her parents teaching her to cook and, most importantly, how to love, showing family bonds provided comfort amidst difficulties. Overall, the mood is a blend of hardship and love, reflecting the complexities of her upbringing.
15	11841	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy, enjoyable, and worth living. I say happy because they had family to be with, and other friends to help them if anything. The presence of supportive relationships fosters a sense of contentment. I say enjoyable because the author talks about how they (main character) had the first birthday and first friend. I would enjoy all my birthdays if I was that person and also my first friend. These milestones contribute to a positive and lighthearted atmosphere. I also said worth living because they had food on their table everyday. And nothing in the memoir said anything about struggling. This security and lack of hardship further reinforce the idea of a fulfilling existence. This is why I explain the mood as happy, enjoyable, and worth living, as the memoir emphasizes positive relationships, joyful experiences, and a stable life.
16	11842	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir was very loving and caring for their friends, family and everyone around them, for example it says how his mom would always keep the door open for whoever was going through a rough time or untill they were back on their feet because she knew they would do the same for her and her family, showing a deep sense of reciprocity and community support. Also the mood is very thankful since Narciso admires everything that he's done in life and who he's helped out and he's thankful for all the friends he has and the care they have for him and his family and he thanks every oppertunity he gets in life, highlighting a profound sense of gratitude for his experiences. The mood also shows how that somthing small can turn out to be big on the inside because Narciso has done so much just from the small place he lives in, demonstrating that impactful contributions can emerge from humble beginnings.

The author describes the ""warmth"" of his kitchen, how it's filled with love and culture, the great aroma of their parents' cooking, and the music from his culture; he loves it. The author also describes how his family is CAPS1 close, and their friends too. The love that they have for each other is palpable. The memoir says, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us.""

The mood is also joyful because, although the author lived in just a simple house, inside, there was always music and he was influenced by his culture. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This sensory detail evokes a feeling of warmth and happiness. After all a house is only a ""home"" if you feel welcome and love, and that is exactly how the author felt. Lastly, the mood is loving because in his home, his parents welcomed anyone who needed help. Example from the memoir is, ""My parents kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us.""

Over all, the author kept the mood lively and definitely happy, although the happiness went on through difficult times like segregation, revealing a resilience rooted in the strong family bonds described."
22	11848	5	3	In the memoir, the author created a very upbeat mood. He clearly is very grateful for his family, and had a happy childhood. He pointed out the parts of his home and situation that could have been negative for him while growing up, but then he cancelled those negative things out by noting the positive aspects of each situation. For example, in the memoir he wrote about how his family had immigrated to the United States, and how they had good jobs in Cuba, but then had to start all over with low-paying jobs once they got here. He said that this was hard for them, but he found a positive way to look at the situation. He did this by writing about how his parent's situation taught them and him to always work hard, and never give up, thus instilling a sense of resilience.

23	11849	5	3	"The mood created by the author of the memoir is cozy and family oriented. From the very beginning, the author describes the home as more of a way of life than a physical space. The author's ""parents created our traditional Cuban home, part of which was the kitchen"" (@NUM1). Here, the home is described even more as a part of the family, less is a building. To enhance the feeling of family, the author includes stories of hospitality: ""My parents always kept their arms and their door to the many people he considered family"" (@NUM2). Hospitality is one of the best qualities you need to make a house a home and the author really stretches that, showcasing how integral welcoming others was to their family dynamic and sense of belonging. The mood created by the author of the memoir is cozy and family oriented."
24	11850	5	3	"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a very happy mood in his memoir. One reason the mood is happy is because of the setting. Narciso describes his house and says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back-drop to life in our warm home."" The author describes a home filled with many good friends and good memories, contributing to the joyous atmosphere. Another reason is how grateful the author sounds.

The mood in this memoir is definitely thankfulness.

It also has a very loving tone to it; anything about a family coming together naturally evokes love, which makes for a heartwarming read."
33	11859	5	3	The author could have put a lot of different types of mood in the memoir. I think that the mood of the memoir is happy, grateful, and appreciative. I said happy because he talks about everything he does and how he enjoys it. I said grateful because he is always thanking his parents, and he admires them. He admires them because they have come last to the good life, and they do everything in their power to have a good life. And he appreciates them because of the same thing I said before: he admires them and always thanks them for what they have done for him. This, therefore, is the mood the author conveys while writing the story.
34	11860	5	3	"In Narciso's memoir, I feel joy. I feel joy because Narciso's parents were able to survive. They came to America, ""without any knowledge of the language or culture."" Hardworking immigrant families do not get on their feet right away, and they did; within a year, they went from a one-room apartment to a two-room apartment. Joy came to my mind also because they had welcoming arms for their family. People today are losing their jobs & homes and they have nobody to go to, but the Rodriguez family had a place to go. ""Countless extended family members came & went- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms & their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This generosity and upward mobility in the face of adversity is truly inspiring, ultimately filling me with joy for the Rodriguez family's success and their unwavering support for one another."

37	11863	5	3	"The authors mood in the memoir Narciso is thankful. I know this, because in paragraph 3 Narciso talks about his culinary skills and how grateful he is to have it passed down to him. This shows us that he is very much thankful for this skill, because some people don't know how to cook and to be able to cook is a blessing. This also shows us that he is proud of his culture and who he is as a person. Narciso quotes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice.""

In this excerpt it stated, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great soliderity and friendship."" This meant that everyone got along with no fighting unlike segregation down South at the time. Another mood is humble. A quote from the text says, ""I will always be greatful to my parent for their love and sacrifice."" This shows that no matter what the author will appreciate his parents. Lastly, the author created the mood modesty. To prove this the author stated, ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life.""

The Cuban music filled the air of the house like it was a house in Cuba, bridging the distance. A house isn't a house untill you call it a home. That family has made that their home forever. Even though their family can't come down till 1970 they too will have a place to call home like Narciso Rodriguez did.

66	11892	5	3	The mood from my perspective would be a calm and cozy sentimental feeling.

75	11901	5	3	"The mood was definitely uplifting and happy. At first, when he describes his ""house,"" he says, ""within these walls my young parents treated our traditional Cuban 'home.'"" You see how he goes from house to home, and then you know it is a happy place for them. With their kitchen as the ""heart"" (a happy heart), Cuban music fills the air, which he adores. This is just a very uplifting story of how he was born into a Cuban, Spanish, and Italian family that dealt with racism, and his parents are welcoming to their big extended family, offering them a place to sleep, eat, and share everything. This is a good family, and like he said, family is not about being blood-related; it's about loving people the way they come and still welcoming them into their homes. Their family is, without a worry, all about love and courage; his parents taught him something special about how you can have more than just a blood-related family.

All the friendships he had and family moments made him love his home. He shows the warmth and love for his family and home, illustrating how deeply rooted his affections are. This creates a sense of nostalgia and appreciation for the simple joys of life centered around family and place.
77	11903	5	3	I think the mood is happy, because Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people live in the same neighborhood without fighting, and it seems like they like their life in the United States. This peaceful coexistence, alongside their apparent contentment, suggests a positive atmosphere within the community. Therefore, the overall feeling conveyed is one of happiness and satisfaction.
78	11904	5	3	I think that the mood created by the author was happiness. I think this because when @CAPS1 was talking throughout the story @CAPS1 talked about how great her life was and how nice your parents are. @CAPS1 talked about her life as being very nice because @CAPS1 grew up in a house that turned into a home, filled with love and laughter. Also, @CAPS1 talked about the great cooking that went on in her house and all of the great music, that @CAPS1 still loves today. Also, @CAPS1 talks about how caring her parents were when they opened there doors to family that needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. Lastly, I think the mood set by the author was happiness because @CAPS1 had a lot of her family or close friends living either above or below them. Those are the reasons I thought the mood set by the author was happiness, illustrating a life filled with warmth and positive experiences.
79	11905	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that family is very important. Family is very important; an example of that in paragraph @NUM1 is when the author @PERSON1 writes, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relatives."" The second way that shows family is important is in paragraph @NUM2 when the author writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The third and final example is in paragraph @NUM3 when the author writes, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 These three examples show that family is the most important thing in the author's life, shaping their values and perspectives."
80	11906	5	3	"The mood of the author in this memoir was happy, grateful, and filled with gratitude. I say happy because in the story the author said ""in our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship."" This suggests a joyful and harmonious atmosphere that clearly contributed to the author's happiness. I say happy because the author was happy to enjoy having so many friends and family come over every day and have fun. Another mood is grateful; the author says in the story ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author says this because the author's parents loved him a lot; they went out every day trying to get money to make sure the author had a good life, and the author was grateful for that. Now, the author had gratitude for all the things the author's parents did: ""parents created our traditional Cuban home,"" also ""passed on to me the rich culinary skills and love for cooking,"" and ""where I celebrated my first birthdays."" The author had gratitude for all these things and more because without the things his parents did, he wouldn't be who he is today, highlighting the profound impact of his upbringing on his identity. Therefore, the author's happy and grateful mood, stemming from the supportive community and loving family, truly shapes the heartwarming tone of this memoir."
81	11907	5	3	I think the mood in this story was sad/happy. I think it was happy because it says he loved to cook, and he expressed joy in creating dishes. And he thanked his parents for teaching him to cook. Also, in paragraph @NUM1, it's a paragraph dedicated to his parents, showing appreciation and love, which contributes to the happy mood. I think it is sad because in paragraph @NUM2 it says his parents had very good jobs, successful careers even, but when they came to the United States, they had to start over, facing hardship and loss. Therefore, the story evokes both happiness and sadness.
82	11908	5	3	In the memoir, the author expressed different moods. One of these moods was appreciative; he was appreciative that his parents made a house into a home filled with warmth and love. They brought him happiness through the way they passed on their rich culinary skills and love of cooking, and also through their passionate Cuban music, which constantly filled the air of his home. The author also expresses how he is grateful that his parents selflessly left their families, friends, and established careers in the country they loved so dearly, all so that they could come to America and bravely start their lives over, striving to have a better life for themselves and, most importantly, for him. Ultimately, this deep sense of gratitude underscores the sacrifices made for him and the beautiful life they built together.
83	11909	5	3	The author in the story created a mood that you could feel all over while reading the article, a feeling of homeliness and peace. He created this feeling because while reading he never uses a word about violence or hate, focusing instead on warmth and connection. Also while reading he talks about how him and his family always helped each other out, sharing chores and offering support during difficult times. He also considers his community family, emphasizing shared values and mutual respect, and that really makes you feel at peace inside and appreciate the simple joys of togetherness. Thus, through careful word choice and a focus on positive relationships, the author successfully cultivates a sense of tranquility.
84	11910	5	3	The move the author created in the memoir was that he made it so theres still hope. Even if your an immigrant you can still make it to the top. @PERSON1's family moved from Cuba when racism was legal. The neighborhood was a family, a place of unity. Now Narciso is a famous fashion designer, showcasing that the American dream is attainable. Coming from Cuba with nothing and starting a new life entirely over was very hard, but he persevered. Ultimately, the memoir successfully conveys a message of hope and resilience, demonstrating the potential for success even amidst adversity.
85	11911	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created is happy and loving. In the memoir it says, ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" A lot of people were very close to his family and he found out you don't have to be blood relatives to be family. Also it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He is happy his parents moved to New Jersey and is grateful of the sacrifices they had to make do do it. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. He went from Just living there to it being his home. He appreciates all his parents have done to make his life better, and the memoir reflects a deep sense of gratitude and love for his upbringing."
86	11912	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is how she learned the definition of ""family"". She learned the definition of ""family"" at what she calls her ""simple house"". I know this because in paragraph @NUM1, she says ""It was here where I learned the definition of ""family."" It was within those walls and among the people she shared them with that her understanding bloomed, shaping her perception of kinship and belonging, ultimately defining what ""family"" meant to her."
87	11913	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author creates a special mood. I think the mood is kind of both happy and sad at the same time. It is sad because the parents had to leave all of their family, friends, and careers back in Cuba, while coming to America not knowing the language. He didn't even get to meet his real grandparents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba. The mood is happy too because the parents did all of this for their child. He gets to live a happy life in their new home, with their new friends. This bittersweet feeling underscores the sacrifices made for a better future, ultimately shaping the author's perspective."
88	11914	5	3	The mood set by the author is a very happy one. This is shown by explaining how happy he is to be a Cuban-American and be free of dark times. He also shows his happiness by explaining his qualities and family, highlighting positive aspects. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez wants people to be happy with their lives and family and heritage, thus creating an uplifting and optimistic mood.
89	11915	5	3	"In this memoir gives a grateful feeling. Some of the reasons I think this is because like in paragraph @NUM1. The author says ""Öour neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuba, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevail in the United States."" But the main part of the story is that how he loves the neighborhood he lives in and the house he lives in and mostly how much the people are basically family in that neighborhood. And that is why I think the author has a grateful mood in the memoir, because despite the challenges of the time, he focuses on the positive aspects of community and belonging, showcasing a deep appreciation for his upbringing."
90	11916	5	3	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood is willing, grateful, and hopeful. ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times,"" that quote represents that the family was willing to go through not having a good job like in Cuba and segregation to make a better life for their kids, even if it meant enduring hardship. ""My parents always kept their door open for the people we considered family,"" this quote shows the family was grateful to have a home and still let the people they loved live there with them, sharing what they had. ""My mother and Father came to this country with such courage, without knowledge of the language and culture,"" that quote showed that the family was hopeful enough that even without knowing about the country they still believed it would bring a better life. In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the family was willing to do anything for a better life, demonstrating their optimism and determination."
91	11917	5	3	"The mood created by the author is showing even though they came From Cuba they can still make a living and become bilingual and translate and help others Find @CAPS1 jobs. For example, ""Often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to got back on their Feet,"" meaning they would help someone until they got a @CAPS2 job or @CAPS3 found a apartment that was good for them and for what the make a month if they had jobs. Therefore, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to many people we considered family"" @CAPS4 helping each other if the had problems. Also the mood was good because they came got an apartment and at the end everyone's happy because it became their Home, demonstrating resilience and community support."
92	11918	5	3	"I think that the author created a very warming, and loving tone. Narciso created this mood by including all of the greatest aspects of his home in @LOCATION1. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 he explains the endless celebrations he had with family and friends that ""... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" further emphasizing the joyous and familial atmosphere that characterized his upbringing. This vivid description evokes a sense of nostalgia and affection, solidifying the warming and loving tone established throughout the piece."
93	11919	5	3	What I think the mood of this story is really soft and explainable, since it explains how these people immigrated from their country to where they live now just to basically get a better life. And they certainly did. They are happy of their home and the @CAPS1 is happy because of his amazing educational options, which contribute to the overall hopeful and contented feeling of the narrative. That is what I would say the mood of this story is.
94	11920	5	3	During Narciso's life, growing up in a small house doesn't matter when you're surrounded by people you love. The author created the mood of happiness, love, achievement, and being proud. Narciso was very proud of his cuban heratige, as well has his brave parents, that created a beautiful home and life for him. The mood was also happy because it's a very happy story. There is love and achievement in the mood as well because Narciso loved his friends, family, neighborhood, home and childhood. The achievement was of his parents comming over to @LOCATION1 and starting a better life. Anyone would be happy with a childhood like that because being surrounded by the ones you love and being proud of you and your family is what is important. It shows that material possessions are not what create happiness, but rather the relationships and sense of belonging that truly matter. Ultimately, Narciso's story emphasizes the importance of family, heritage, and love in creating a fulfilling and joyful life.
95	11921	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir was very grateful. Narciso was very, very grateful for the ""house that his parents turned into a home."" And he was very grateful to his overall parents, for giving up their own life, to try to give their son a better one, with many more opportunities than they had. He is also grateful to his parents, not only for giving him things they never had, but things they did have, too, like love and support. Things like teaching them how to cook, how to treat others, and the real meaning of family. They also showed him the value of being selfless for someone you love, solidifying his appreciation for their sacrifices. Therefore, gratitude is the overwhelming emotion conveyed."
96	11922	5	3	No matter what nationality you are you can get along with anyone. He shows that his home, to him at least was a wonderful PLACE with nice smells, food, and people. He is unexplainably happy and grateful for what his Parents did for him. To him it was PARADISE/heaven on earth. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in the humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not Just scent and music but love and life. He will never forget that house or its gracious neigh bor hood.
97	11923	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez a certain mood is created by the author. The mood is happiness and joyfulness because in this memoir the author continues to talk on about his family a culture which is a perfect reason for the mood to be happy. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" this quot was found in @CAPS1 @NUM1, this quot also shows that his family was kind and generous, further contributing to the cheerful atmosphere. This mood involved the familys culture which Narciso loved so much and clearly valued. His beautiful culture was just another piece of the puzzel that fit together, and that last quot ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house in to a home"" found in @CAPS1 @NUM2 really puts every thing together touching the reader emotionally, solidifying the overall mood of warmth and contentment."
98	11924	5	3	"The mood that was created by the author in the memoir would be, I believe, love. I said love because basically throughout the whole story all that was being talked about was ""eternal @CAPS1"", ""a dore"", bonds, and unity. The family are immigrants and they came looking for a better lifestyle in a foreign country just for the benefit of the children. From my point of view, only loving parents would give up the country they all love in order to do something like that because they had to leave behind families, friends, and careers. They're now facing cultural hardships over just one decision, highlighting the depth of their affection. Ultimately, the sacrifices made underscore the pervasive mood of love that permeates the memoir."
99	11925	5	3	In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez the mood is very warm and inviting. It is of home and family. Some examples of this are, he mentions that the kitchen was the heart of the home and the Cuban music was playing all the time, creating a lively atmosphere. The memoir also conveys a sense of family because the author often mentions large amounts of family and friends would often be visiting, sharing meals and stories. He also mentions there was rarely a time when family wasn't staying with them in their home until they got back on their feet, highlighting the family's generosity. The mood of this memoir is warming and of family, ultimately painting a picture of a close-knit and supportive environment.
100	11926	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is very adventurous. In the memoir it showed how Narciso's parent's and relatives moved, showcasing their determination. At first Narciso lived in a furnished one-room apartment, then through hard work and saving, they could afford to move into a modest three-room apartment that was soon to be Narciso's home. Narciso was born in 1961, in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey, a place that would shape his early years. Narciso grew up with his family for a while. ""Family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative, but rather the close-knit community that supported them. Narciso will always be greatful and loving to his parents for what they did for him, providing a stable and loving environment despite their humble beginnings, ultimately setting him on a path of opportunity."
101	11927	5	3	In the author's memoir the author creates a mood, and that mood in the story is happiness and joy. It is happiness and joy because he was happy for his home and how his parents were cooks. He also enjoyed the music and things he does with his family and realizes this. I think this is the mood the author used in the memoir, effectively conveying a sense of contentment and appreciation for his upbringing and familial bonds.
102	11928	5	3	Narciso Rodriguez, in his memoir about growing up in a new environment with his family, puts a definite mood in the memoir. The mood, to put it in general terms, is happy. The author did not put any negative information in the memoir and only put a positive feeling. In paragraph two, the author explains how his parents brought their Cuban heritage into their home like food, music, family gatherings, and fun celebrations. All of that set a very happy backdrop for the family. In paragraph four, Narciso shows that there was always people over and having a fun time. Narciso's surrogate grandparents, babysitter, cousins, and aunts and uncles came and had a good time. Finally in paragraph six, the author sums it up and tells that he will always be grateful for his parents' love and sacrifice. His parents were thanked repeatedly by him for their strength and perseverance and taught him that friends and family are very important. Overall, this memoir had a very positive and happy mood, showcasing a life filled with love, cultural richness, and strong family bonds.
103	11929	5	3	"Home and family is the MOST important one thing all of us love. The mood the author created was heartwarming and appreciation, because he explains how comfortable his home is with everyone, together having a good time. Not only just being together but being together: ""Growing up in this environment instilled in him a great sense that 'family' [has] nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Narciso Rodriguez shows his appreciation for his parents he loved so much because they had to make an important change to give him a better life which he deserved. They had made this change ""even though it meant leaving behind their families."" Such bravery they had. The author left us knowing his appreciation for his ""home,"" being grateful for his parents and his Hispanic heritage, ultimately conveying the profound impact of family and cultural roots on shaping one's identity."
104	11930	5	3	"The author created a mood in the memoir. The author creates the mood of friendliness. I know this because in the text it says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This means that even though there was segregation around them, their neighborhood was still friendly. All and all, the author created a mood in the memoir, showcasing a sense of community and warmth that transcended societal barriers."
105	11931	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir is excellent. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This gives me the feeling of thankfulness and to really admire what my parents have done for me. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""It was here I learned the real definition of family."" This quote makes me feel so happy that I have a family that supports me and is always there for me. This memoir really changed how I look at things and made me realize how thankful I am to have my family."
106	11932	5	3	"The way the author describes his family and his home gives the memoir a very warm, happy, and pleasant mood. He had a very warm tone when he talks about how much love there was in his house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, and the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This sense of belonging truly paints a picture of a joyful upbringing. The mood of the memoir was happy and uplifting when he talked about how his parents helped others and they always had people in their house. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This constant giving created a home filled with gratitude and connection. The mood of the memoir was brought to life when the author described the rich culture in his home. ""traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.... Unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" I think the addition in the parentheses make it light and airy. His tone is thrilled and thankful for his rich culture, showcasing his deep appreciation. The author's tone was very sweet, I think, when thanking his parents. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me... and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.... and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" Ultimately, thanks to the author’s vivid and heartfelt descriptions, the memoir's mood is successfully conveyed as warm, happy, and sweet."
107	11933	5	3	The mood changed throughout the memoir. First, the mood started off depressing by saying in Cuba they had a one-room furnished apartment. That when they came to America and Roberto's father could afford to move into a modest three-room apartment. Next, the mood was inspiring. It was inspiring because the parents were a poor family and they found a way to move out of Cuba. Also, because his parents were selflessly getting out of Cuba so their children could have a better place to live. Lastly, there was a mood of family. They were honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to help people in need. Also, they always had Alegria graced at the dinner table for meals and had the surrogated grandparents Sergio and Abuela there too. The mood changed throughout the whole memoir from depressing to inspiring and to family, which it always was about at its core.
108	11934	5	3	Narciso was very proud of his cuban culture. He was very happy with who he had become, and how he had been raised. Narciso set a very proud and greatful tone to this memoir. He explains that family isnt about blood relations; its about people who love eachother, and are going to be there for eachother. He told us that his parents passed on the cuban culture to him, in cooking, sharing recipes and traditions passed down through generations. He also explained how his parents built the home on their own, brick by brick, that he got to grow up in. Narciso says how proud he is to be a cuban, and how his family works @CAPS1 hard to earn a living, instilling in him a strong work ethic. Narciso told us how proud and happy he was, to be in a nice home, with friends, family, and a future. He told us he learned to love, appreciate, and cherish everything he had.
109	11935	5	3	H loved His parents. H also loved his home. Memories of this birthday are always there, always music, always the smell of good food, making it a truly special occasion.
110	11936	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, creates a mood of hardship, and gratefulness. [pg. @NUM1] ""after living for a year in a furnished one-room apartment, @NUM2-year-old Rawedia and twenty-sevem-year-old Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon call home."" @CAPS1 hardship how they moved from Cuba to the @LOCATION2 and had to leave everything behind to start a new life, in a small, little, apartment.

I think the memoir is a very heartwarming story of a family that loves one another and his thankful that they have a place they can call home."
111	11937	5	3	"The mood created by the author is one of blithe and thankfullness. The reasons that it is thankful if because of the frequent refrences made by the author to the courage and bravery shown by his parents. This is shown in CHAPTER 1 when the author said ""they came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrears in the country they loved"" This quote from CHAPTER 1 shows how grateful Narciso is of his parents leaving everything they had to make a better life for him. The last sentence of the memoir is ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" This is showing that the mood is Grateful because Narciso means that he's is thankful because they were able to turn their little house into a place of great friendships and great times. The last reason this article has a mood relative to thankfullness is shown in CHAPTER 3 when Narciso says ""But, in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and a demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This sentence shows that no matter what Narciso does he can never repay his parents for their selflessness and care. The reason this article is also happy is shown in CHAPTER 4 when he talks of ""the endless celebrations"" or ""a love of cooking that is still with me today..."" This is showing the mood is happy and joyous because it is clear that as a boy the kitchen and cooking were a source of happiness and laughter in his home. These are reasons as to why the author has created memoir with a mood of happiness and gratefulness, crafting a poignant reflection on family, love, and the immigrant experience."
112	11938	5	3	"In the memoir ""Home: The Blueprints Of Our Lives"" the author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a very loving mood. When Narciso Rodriguez is talking about his home he writes, ""Within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was my kitchen."" This shows his love for his kitchen. Similarly, another author shows his love for cooking when he writes, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and un wittingly passed on to me their rich culinory skills and a love for cooking that is still with me today."" The author provides us the love that he has for his parents when he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Furthermore, the author tells us that his parents were very loving when he writes, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" These sentiments collectively paint a picture of a warm and supportive upbringing, underscoring the profound impact of family love and tradition."
113	11939	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir was happy, loving, and warm. The memoir is basically about family and how important family is. When you talk about your family, and its culture, you usually dont feel sad about it. Throughout the memoir, the author says things like, ""a love of cooking that is still with me today"" and ""formed a backdrop to life in our warm home"". The author also talks about the selflessness of his parents, which he is very proud and gratefull for. He states in paragraph @NUM1, that his parents, ""kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" The author also states in paragraph @NUM2 that, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance.""

114	11940	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. The author uses words such as warm to describe things. ""Warm homes"" gives you a happy feeling and gives you a happy mood overall. It makes you think about how happy the author is knowing they still have their family memories/skills. In fact, the author uses many words which set the mood of happiness, like ""warmth of kitchen, humble home, not just scent and music but life and love, gracious neighborhood, and simple house into a home."" These choice words used by the author give you a good feeling and put you in a happy mood, showing the joy the author finds in these memories."
115	11941	5	3	"The mood created by the author is warmth. First off, in paragraph two, it says how his family would always cook food and turn on the cuban music. It also says how the smell of the food would fill the house, creating a welcoming and comforting atmosphere. In paragraph four, it says how they would always have family members over for dinner. Some of the family members they would have were Grandparents, Aunts, Uncles, and cousins. The lively gatherings further contribute to the feeling of closeness. The last reason the mood is warmth is because he said in paragraph seven, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That means that before they lived there, it was just three rooms; however, once they moved in, they turned it into a place where friends and family could gather and have fun, thus solidifying the feeling of warmth and belonging."

117	11943	5	3	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, we learn about his childhood, and Narciso affects the mood by describing the setting. He writes, ""could afford to go into a modest three room apartment..."" in paragraph @NUM1. This gives a humble feeling from the very beginning. In paragraph @NUM2, he writes, ""passionate Cuban music filled the air..."". This evokes a sense of rich culture. Narciso writes things like these throughout his memoir, and these lines contribute to the mood of modesty and rich Cuban culture. Narciso also writes about his birthday and family. The parts about family give a feeling of unity. These details effectively create the memoir's overall mood."
118	11944	5	3	In the memoir, the author creates a mood. The feeling, or mood, that I think that the author is trying to create is a very grateful mood. I say this because that author is talking about how he is grateful, or thankful, to his parents for teaching him valuable life lessons and for bringing him up in a home and neighborhood that was very united and close, where everyone looked out for each other. This sense of community fostered a deep appreciation in the author, making the overall tone one of thankfulness.

As noted in @CAPS2 @NUM1, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immagrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" @CAPS1 conveys a feeling of acceptance, illustrating how various cultures and ethnicities learned to coexist as a unified ""family"" despite facing a racist environment. @CAPS1 also shares the sacrifices his parents made, leaving behind loved ones to provide a better future for their children (@CAPS2 @NUM2).

In @CAPS2 @NUM3, @CAPS1 expresses, ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity and impressed upon me and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" Ultimately, the author's memoir is a testament to his deep love and appreciation for his parents and the values they instilled in him."
120	11946	5	3	The mood that was created by the author is loving. It teaches the reader that the heart felted sacrifice and hardship the parents endured is priceless and the love that an immigrant family has for one another is endless. This mood explains the true definition of family and the unconditional, unfadeable love that a family has for one another and for its neighbor. This is true because in paragraph @NUM1 it tells the reader how grateful the author is for having such persistent, loving parents whose faith and determination for a better future taught the author how to love and appreciate the courage and strength one must have to overcome the struggles and barriers on this pursuit of happiness everyone is destined to follow. The mood of this memoir explains how precious is a home and the memories contained in it, highlighting the warmth and security found within those walls. This powerful feeling is the mood the author successfully created in his memoir.
121	11947	5	3	The mood that's created by the author in the memoir is happiness but at the same time sadness or to give up. Happiness is one mood because the author describes how his family has lived in New Jersey and how his family was not the only one to immigrate from their country. Their neighborhood is made up of Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants, creating a vibrant and diverse community. The author has also made a few friends, his first one being Alegria, the landlord's daughter, showing the beginnings of a new life. But the author did show some sadness when he and his family had left Cuba. They had left friends, family, jobs, and their country that they had loved, marking a significant loss. The author still listens to Cuban music when he cooks, a reminder of his past. Ultimately, the memoir evokes a bittersweet feeling, blending the joy of new beginnings with the sorrow of leaving behind a cherished homeland.
122	11948	5	3	"The mood that the author sets is thankfullness. He is thankful for all the things, scarifices his parents had to for him. For example ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give thier children a better life, even thought it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This act of immense personal cost underscores the depth of their devotion. This profound gratitude is why the author wrote this memoir to thank his parents for what they did for him, a lasting testament to their unwavering commitment."
123	11949	5	3	In the memoir the author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a mood of faith throughout the reading. As the author describes the parents moving into the United States, it tells how they had to leave behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. The motivation to do so reveals the parents faith in creating a home just as good as before, one filled with love and opportunity. The author is very grateful as he admires his parents faith that has traveled so far over time, shaping their decisions and guiding their paths. Rodriguez believes his parents have more courage then anyone and have expressed so much generosity upon him and others to always have their arms open to help others. It was the parents faith at the struggles would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times, ultimately shaping the author's perspective and appreciation for their sacrifices. It is this enduring faith that serves as the backbone of their family story.
124	11950	5	3	The mood that is created by the EVENTS in the memoir's...The only WORD I can give for a mood is Friendship. Throughout the whole memoir the EVENTS revolve around everyone and is connected to each CHARACTER and MOMENT, showing how the whole memoir is about Friendship, solidifying the overall amicable feeling.
125	11951	5	3	"Reading this article expresses many different moods from the author. While reading you can notice he's proud of his Cuban culture, explaining how united his family has always been for as long as he can remember. Most importantly, he's so grateful to his parents for everything they've been through to see him succeed in life, and that's what I admire most from the author. This story is giving thanks to his parents and his culture. His mood is mostly proud and thankful throughout the whole story. Like at the end when he says ""I learned the definition of 'family',"" meaning his family was there for each other and love was all over. This passage made me realize everything my mother went through to see my brother and I succeed, so I can say I can relate to the author, and his expression of gratitude truly resonates."
126	11952	5	3	The mood created in the memoir is gratitude. Narciso is telling the story in honor of his parents’ selflessness. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, seeking a better life. They worked as hard as they could, often taking on grueling jobs, and made him a home and a childhood he could be happy with, filled with love and opportunity. This memoir serves as a heartfelt tribute to their sacrifices.
127	11953	5	3	The mood of the author is happy because he loves his home and it is where he really wants to be. He also loves his culture and where he came from; he loves his parents and the skills they gave him during his childhood, like storytelling and respect for elders. That is why I think his mood is very happy and content, rooted in a deep appreciation for his origins.
128	11954	5	3	"The mood that the author of this memoir is one of love and togetherness. The way that he describes his parents hard work and love is incredible. First, it says in @CAPS2 @NUM1 ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find."" This demonstrates love beyond comparison seeing as they had to start over from scratch stepping down far beneath their potential to care for their children. They never gave up but instead kept going to try and give their children a better life than they would have had. Also this memoir expresses togetherness not only in the family but in the community as a whole. As it says in @CAPS2 @NUM2 ""Ö Our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrantsÖ"" @CAPS1 even though they were of all kinds of races ""It was a close ñ knit community of honest hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" (@CAPS2 @NUM2) This was a community who cared for each other and helped out anybody in need of help despite race. His parents also kept their doors open and allowed people to just come in and stay until they were able to get back up onto their feet, trusting that they would receive the same kindness in return if ever needed. This takes a community that is very close to be able to do something like this. These are but a few of the different examples throughout this memoir that illustrate the mood that the author creates of love and togetherness, showcasing the strong bonds within both his family and the immigrant community they were a part of."
129	11955	5	3	I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could ever do, considering all the challenges they faced.
130	11956	5	3	This memoir had one theme that meant many different things. One theme was helpful. The family moved to the @LOCATION1 from Cuba in 1956 and had many hard ships and struggles. Because they know what it feels like they decisded to help the other struggling people, and let them stay with them; that's exactly what they did. Another theme that I thought fit was inspiration. I think this family not only inspiried their children but other neighbors and other reletives. Last, I think another theme of this excerpt was heart ñ felt. The @CAPS1 ñ @CAPS2 family risked everything to help other families. That's was a very nice action they took on them. One person can slowly make a difference, person by person; that is exactly what this family did. Therefore, the act of kindness and support showcased by this family highlights the power of empathy and inspires others to make a difference in their communities.
131	11957	5	3	"The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, is clear in the memoir. You can sense throughout the whole story that he is completely grateful to his parents for the love they gave him, and their home life. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen"". Rodriguez is ""eternally grateful"" for his parents who ""unwittingly passed on to meet their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today"". They always had Passionate Cuban music that filled the air ""Mixing with kitchen aromas."" The sounds and smells created a sensory experience that grounded him. At the end of paragraph @NUM1, he says ""Here, the innocence of childhood, congregation of family + friends, and endless celebrations form the backdrop to life in our warm home. I will never forget how my parents turned this house into a home."" This profound sense of gratitude underscores the entire narrative, revealing a deep appreciation for the nurturing environment his parents provided."
132	11958	5	3	The author was speaking very proudly and happy about her parents. The author explained how her parents were very courageous and brave for leaving their homeland. That's because neither of them spoke English. Also because they had to leave their lives back at home and start all over again, facing the unknown with unwavering determination and a hope for a better future for their children. Their resilience in adapting to a new culture and language is a testament to their strength.
133	11959	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is happy because it is talking about Narciso's memories. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The mood is also appreciative. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" The mood is also tinged with sadness. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" So there were several moods coexisting within this memoir."
134	11960	5	3	"In this excerpt, Narciso Rodriguez describes his childhood home and extended ""family."" The mood of this duration is very warm and happy. Narciso speaks of his childhood home with only love and affection. He's eternally grateful to his parents for turning ""... this simple house into a home."" He speaks admirably of his parents and the sacrifices and hard work they went through to even get to New Jersey, and he is so thankful they did. He also speaks lovingly of his ""extended family"" and describes his neighborhood. ""In our neighborhood..., all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This loving, supporting ""family"" made Narciso who he is today and made him appreciate the fact that ""' family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" but instead is composed of those whom you love and who love you, ultimately shaping his identity and values."
135	11961	5	3	Happy. You should always be proud of where you came from. Not only that but back your background like your culture and your parents. Stuff like that. Never be ashamed about stuff like that even if you're different it shouldn't matter. The more different you are, the more unique you are. Just look at it that way, and embrace it. Plus, you should never change just because of what you are and what you look like. Your heritage and individuality are what make you special, so be happy with who you are and where you come from.
136	11962	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, Rodriguez created a mood of gratefulness toward his mother and father. Numerous times, he wanted to thank his mother and father. For example, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" Rodriguez is so grateful for his parents because they left Cuba to start a new life in New Jersey. They sacrificed leaving their friends and family behind. In the text, it says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" His parents sacrificed so much just to give Rodriguez a better life, and that's why he creates the mood of gratefulness in his memoir. It is clear that their selfless act of immigrating shaped his profound appreciation."
137	11963	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir is united, caring, loving and more. The author is combining all of those moods together and memories to write this memoir, which is what a memoir is about: yourself, memories, family, and etc. A reason why the author created these moods is because a home is where a family lives together and where they hold memories together, which shows loving. For example in the memoir, ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of a family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" which is obviously the mood of loving, because they're all a loving family together. This warmth and togetherness are central to the author's portrayal of their upbringing. A second reason why the author created these moods is because in the place where the author lived there were many different people from different places. Even though they all weren't the same, they acted as a family and were united. For example, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship,"" which means that even though they're different, they're going to be there for one another, which is united. This sense of community fostered a feeling of belonging. A third reason why the author created these moods is because the author's parents weren't just caring for themselves but for others also, just like their children. For example, ""They come selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life,"" which means her parents weren't just caring about them but the future for their son. This selfless dedication highlights their caring nature. The whole story is based on home and family, but the thing is that a home and family will always share the love, caring, and unity of one another, shaping the author's narrative and emphasizing the importance of these bonds in their life."
138	11964	5	3	"The mood of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is calm much the same throughout the whole excerpt. In the story, the mood the whole time is calm and relaxed. Narciso talks about his family and how much he loves them and what they have done for him. It says in the story ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Calm much throughout the story, this is the mood. Another mood created by the author is gratefulness and thankfulness. Narciso is thankful to his parents selflessness. In the story, Narciso says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The way he talks about his parents ends up making the reader thankful too. Narciso Rodriguez creates happy moods for us by the way he writes with love about his family and how he cares so much about what they did for him, solidifying the overall positive and appreciative tone."
139	11965	5	3	"The mood created by the memoir is thankful and proud. In paragraph @NUM1 it shows that he is thankful, speaking of values “… still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.) It also shows that Narciso Rodriguez is proud to be Cuban. In paragraph @NUM2, it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" highlighting his appreciation for their support. This also shows that Narciso is thankful for everything his parents did for him. Narciso also said that he often told them of his admiration for their strength and perseverance, demonstrating his deep respect. In the last paragraph, it says that he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house into a home. This shows that he is thankful for his parents and the nurturing environment they created, emphasizing the strong sense of gratitude that permeates his reflections."
140	11966	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of happiness and unity. In the first paragraph, it describes a couple coming to Newark, New Jersey from Cuba who settles down and has a baby. Within the story, it describes their life here in Newark, what their house is like and the importance of cooking and music from Cuba. In Newark, New Jersey this family invites friends and family for dinner and such; the author describes how it brought everyone together and the mood of unity and happiness flourished through these gatherings. The mood of this memoir is therefore happiness and unity, skillfully created by the author through vivid descriptions of family life and shared traditions.
141	11967	5	3	The mood of this excerpt is happy. It's apparent there are many things he could be happy for. The fact that his parents as children didn't live to great lives and allowing their children to have better ones is great. And also, the home is bringing the family closer together, fostering a sense of joy and togetherness.
142	11968	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is caring and happiness. There is a lot of caring and happiness in this story. There is a lot of caring because he cares about his family and all that they do for him. He also cares that his parents made the house traditional just like back in Cuba. He also cares that his parents do so much for other people in the community. There is a lot of happiness because he is happy to live in @LOCATION1 and to have such wonderful parents. He is happy that his parents teach him all the traditional things that they used to do in Cuba, keeping their heritage alive. Last but not least, he is happy because he lives with everyone he loves, creating a strong sense of belonging and contentment that permeates the memoir.
143	11969	5	3	"The author created a good mood in the memoir because, when you think about how sticked those people were, you have a warm feeling inside. The parents left their country and came to another without any knowledge of her language and culture; they had to start over their lives with the job they could find because they wanted a good life for their child. Overcoming obstacles together, they handed a hand to people who were in need, considered all their neighbors as family, and they taught their children the real definition of ""family."" Their strong bonds and selfless actions are genuinely heartwarming."
144	11970	5	3	"The mood created in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is grateful and happy. First, Narciso Rodriguez is very grateful because he says ""...To give their children a better life."" His parents gave up what they were doing in their homeland Cuba to come live in @LOCATION1 to make a better life for their child to start off and live in. Narciso Rodriguez recognizes this sacrifice, but he also knows he can never do enough to thank them. Next, it says ""family has nothing to do with love relatives."" Narciso Rodriguez is very grateful and thankful that he grew up in the neighborhood he did where everyone was treated like brothers and sisters and they all felt safe in their community that they created. Also the story says ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" Narciso Rodriguez knows that it took a lot of heart to do that much for someone else when all it did for his parents was make their life tougher. They had to start over, and that is what made him most grateful for his parents. This deep appreciation for his upbringing and his parents' sacrifices is what truly shapes the grateful and happy mood of the story."
145	11971	5	3	The mood in this story by Narciso Rodriguez was that in his house he shared many memories. He also shared his feelings freely within those walls. His family would often let people into their house, be they close friends or extended family, creating a welcoming atmosphere.
146	11972	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives is a magnificent mood. A family move to the United States from Cuba so @CAPS1 could have a better education. They have a nice home, nice friends, and a good and caring family. The neighbor, landlord, or friend Alegria makes them dinner sometimes. Also, they have friends that go over for dinner and often bring some food over with them, showing their generosity and connection. They have family/friends that were Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people, a diverse group enriching their lives. They always had their door open for friends and family, and most of their friends would go over every night, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere. They would let people stay at their house if they needed help or if they had to rest. The mood was magnificent in this story, reflecting a sense of community, love, and support."
147	11973	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood that is overall cheerful, warm, and happy. He does this through his word choice. ""passed on to me their rich culinary skills, and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" (par @NUM1). He describes his parents' cooking skills as ""rich"" and his feelings toward cooking as positive, setting a joyful tone. Another example of the mood he creates is how he describes his relationships with other people. ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (par @NUM2). From this quote, you can tell that he has a very close relationship with all the people, further emphasizing the positive atmosphere. Another example is when he says, ""always filled the air with not just scent and music, but life and love."" (par. @NUM3). You can feel the warmth of the room with the adjectives he uses, highlighting the loving environment he grew up in. This is how the author creates the mood in the story, weaving a tapestry of happiness and warmth through careful and deliberate language."
148	11974	5	3	In this memoir, the author touches upon serious facts while giving the memoir a fun and happy mood. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 they talked about how others who aren't even related to them come to do different activities with them, while still touching upon a serious topic about how his real grandparents weren't allowed to leave Cuba until 1970 due to political restrictions. The author also shows how even though they struggled and went through hardships in their home in the @LOCATION2, a place that posed its own challenges, they were still able to keep their Cuban culture going along with the music they played and food. He portrays a mood that shows you can be happy no matter what the hardships you endure, highlighting resilience and the importance of cultural identity.
149	11975	5	3	The mood of the memoir *From Home: The Blueprint of Our Lives* is a grateful ode. Narciso tells the story about the way he grew up in @LOCATION1, raised by his Cuban parents. Narciso is very grateful that his parents taught him to cook and introduced him to Cuban music, which he loves. Narciso is always grateful for having parents who have given him much love and sacrifice. Narciso also admires his parents for their perseverance and strength. He has thanked them so many times but feels he can't fully express how truly grateful he is to them. Throughout the memoir, Narciso talks about his gratefulness, which undeniably sets the overall mood.
150	11976	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is depressing, especially when recalling the initial struggles. I think that because it talks about his parents getting immigrated and facing numerous challenges, but then the end is sort of happy, because his parents persevered and turned it into a home, suggesting a long journey from hardship to contentment. This contrast highlights the initial bleakness.
151	11977	5	3	The mood that the author has in the memoir is grateful because she keeps talking about her parents and how they gave up their lives in Cuba for her, demonstrating a deep appreciation for their sacrifices. This sense of thankfulness permeates her reflections on their difficult decisions.
152	11978	5	3	In the memoir, the author creates a specific mood to help the reader better relate to his life's story. The mood of this memoir is cozy in the beginning as he describes what his house was like and his own definition of family. As the memoir continues, the mood shifts to how grateful the author feels toward his parents. He describes how their selfless acts of leaving Cuba and creating a new life in Miami, helped create a strong foundation for him to grow up on. He says how his parents left behind their friends, family and jobs in the hope that their children would have a better life. His parents came to Miami, with no knowledge of the language and having to endure many hardships in finding and keeping jobs. The author says how he can't put his grateful feelings into words but is completely in their debt for taking such a big risk in coming to Miami. In the memoir, the author creates a specific mood to entice and interest the reader as they read more about his life.
153	11979	5	3	"The author creates many moods in this memoir. Firstly, a mood that the author sets is warmth, figurative warmth. For example in paragraph @NUM1, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" which is a perfect description of something that makes you feel warm inside. Secondly, another mood the author sets is compassion because he talks fondly and with compassion for his parents. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""My parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved... The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times,"" which is very compassionate and full of emotion. Lastly, a mood I think the author sets is acceptance, because his parents were so willing to take in people that weren't always blood related. For example in paragraph @NUM3, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us,"" which states that they were very welcoming and accepting people. These examples clearly showcase the warmth, compassion, and acceptance that permeate the author's recollections, effectively shaping the overall tone and emotional landscape of the memoir."
154	11980	5	3	"This @CAPS1 shows a lot of different types of moods that one person can have towards friends, family, and your heritage. Narciso Rodriguez explains that family is really all you need. His parents moved from Cuba to the United States so their family, especially their kids, could have a good and successful life. Narciso is very grateful that his parents would put their past behind them and their family just so their kids could be better people. When his parents first moved here they were struggling both personally and financially. When they came they went to a neighborhood where there was mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. In this memoir, it talks a great deal about family, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" With different types of heritages sitting around their table, they noticed that it was not just about who gave birth to you, and who is their siblings and soon, but who helped you out through your life. Another type of mood that this memoir portrays is that you have to be happy with who you are as a person. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family. Knowing that they would do the same for us."" This memoir's mood is mostly about love and who you will be proud about. They're setting a tone that says you shouldn't be discouraged about who you are and where you come from, but to be proud about who you are as a person, showing that self-acceptance and love for one's roots are essential for a fulfilling life."
155	11981	5	3	The mood the author created in the memoir was reflective, expressing what it was like to experience certain life events. He was explaining how he was really happy that their parent gave up everything in Cuba just to come be with their children, even though they didnt even know how to speak english when they first moved from cuba. So now pretty much their whole family lives close to each other so they can all see each other. Even if the parents can't find the jobs there looking for they were going to do whatever to make their family happy. Now that their family is together, they can spend the rest of their life happy together, a testament to their enduring love and commitment.
156	11982	5	3	"The mood created by the author, @CAPS1, is one of gratitude and pride. He talks about how families come from everywhere, and Narciso Rodriguez is proud of coming from Cuba. This pride is evident in his words: ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" He expresses deep appreciation for his heritage and upbringing. The mood is further shaped by his admiration for his parents: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" The overall tone reflects a sense of thankfulness and respect, as he concludes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" solidifying the story's heartfelt mood."
157	11983	5	3	He gives a mood of friendliness and happy memories. He tries to make the reader feel the happy feelings he felt, so that people would understand how he feels and tried to relate to it. Childhood memories are supposed to give those feelings to the reader, acting as a bridge to connect with them on an emotional level and foster a sense of shared experience. Ultimately, by evoking these positive emotions associated with youth, he aims to create a deeper understanding and resonance with his audience.
158	11984	5	3	The mood Narciso Rodriguez is trying to portray in this memoir is very relaxing and grateful. He wants to be able to show his readers that he is grateful for how his parents raised him and what type of environment it was. By reading this memoir one almost feels like they are at his house, surrounded by his friends and family, enjoying the warmth of his upbringing. Narciso Rodriguez is also trying to show happiness, how he was happy with his life and always having friends around him, suggesting a fulfilling and positive personal journey. Through these feelings, Rodriguez effectively conveys a sense of contentment and appreciation for his roots.
159	11985	5	3	"The mood created by the author of the @CAPS1 Home: Blueprints of Our Lives is love. One example of this is in paragraph @NUM1, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote shows that even though they technically weren't family, they still loved each other enough to be family, showcasing a love that transcends biological ties. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 and it says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote shows that they love each other more than anything; they are leaving behind everything and would do anything to give them better lives, signifying a profound parental love. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote shows that for his parents loving him, he gives them love back through gratitude, demonstrating reciprocal love. That is the mood in the @CAPS1 Home: Blueprints of Our Lives."
160	11986	5	3	The author of this memoir gave the memoir a peaceful mood. This memoir focused mainly on friends and family getting together to celebrate. It made it peaceful because the author gives the reader the feeling that their was nothing to worry about. The author never mentioned any negative activity in the memoir, maintaining a sense of tranquility. He just explained how he was very thankful for how his parents raised him and the lessons that his parents taught him. He mentioned how thankful he was for his parents since they were willing to sacrafice things in their lives for the benefit of their children. The author made the reader feel like Narciso was protected in the house he lived in because all his neighbors were so united with each other that they were all friendly to each other so there was nothing to worry about. They all cared for each other so they would protect each other if anythin bad were to happen which gives the memoir a peaceful and worryless mood. The author talks about how his house was simple, warm, humble, and full of his memories which is another reason I think the memoir had a peaceful mood. When you read the memoir, you can see how the author only talked about good things and a worryless life which really gives the memoir a peaceful mood. These are some reasons that show how this memoir has a peaceful mood given by the author who wrote it, crafting a narrative that emphasizes contentment and security.
161	11987	5	3	"The mood created by the memoir is very explicit. He shows that he loves where he is and he doesn't want to trade it for anything. He loves his neighborhood because for him it's like a ""melting pot"". There are Italians, cubans and Spanish people living there. In paragraph three, the author explains how his parents house and doors are open to anyone who needs help getting back on their feet. The author also gives a sad mood at the memoir. In paragraph four, his parents lived in a one-room apartment hoping that one day, they can afford to live in a three-room apartment. That contrast between present contentment and past hardship is the overall mood the author conveys in the memoir."
162	11988	5	3	"In the memoir the author has various moods. In paragraph @NUM1 it DESCRIBES, ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family... my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" The mood here is nuetral but kind of happy because the author is talking about her house. In paragraph @NUM2 it DESCRIBES, ""They Struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" This mood is SAD because the author is talking about the parents hardships. Also, in paragraph @NUM3, it DESCRIBES, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This also shows that the mood is happy because the author is grateful. These are the various moods that the author had in the memoir."
163	11989	5	3	"The author creates a proud mood in the memoir. The author gives information about his background and how his parents were proud of it. Paragraph two states ""I was born into this simple house...my young parents created our traditional Cuban home...the innocence of childhood, congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Narciso's parents tried to influence as much of their Cuban heritage as they could, instilling values and traditions. Narciso's parents were always kind and loving to others. Paragraph four states ""My parents always kept their arms open and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Though his parents didn't seem to have much money, they still housed others until they got back on their feet, demonstrating their generosity. Narciso's parents worked hard knowing that they wouldn't get what they deserved. Paragraph five states ""The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" His parents worked hard for what they worked for, showing resilience, and no one can take that away. In conclusion, the author makes the reader feel proud for what Narciso's parents have done, highlighting their strength of character."
164	11990	5	3	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, the fashion designer from Newark, New Jersey, Narciso talks about his Cuban family living in an apartment with many other races. This presents a mood of happiness. The first way the mood presents happiness, is when RODRIGUEZ talks about his kitchen ""Passionate Cuban music, filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (Rodriguez 25) this shows that it was very happy and exciting in their kitchen. Another way is when Rodriguez talks about his parents SACRIFICE ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"" (Rodriguez 48) This presents a happy mood because he is grateful for what his parents have done. Finally, the last way is when Rodriguez concludes the memoir, ""warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a cuban feast alway filled the air, with not just the sent but life and love."" (Rodriguez 92) This shows the happy times they had together. As you can see, the mood that is presented is happiness, stemming from familial love and cultural vibrancy."
165	11991	5	3	"The @CAPS1 in this memoir is joy and happiness. There is also caring and selflessness. This memoir describes how @ORGANIZATION1 grew up and his meaning of family. His family was very genorous to the people in their @CAPS2. On paragraph @NUM1 it says ""countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone Staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet"". His family was (seemed) very giving to their community. Because of Narciso's culture and family values, they have impacted his life today. Narciso parents were selfless, always putting others' needs before their own. They would give up their living space to a friend who was having a hard time. They always had more then @NUM2 people at the dinner table and always more then @NUM2 people staying at their house. All these events have left Narciso Rodriguez with a sense of pride in his family and community, shaping his understanding of compassion and generosity."
166	11992	5	3	I think the author's mood was kind of like @CAPS1. I said that because as he was going along in the memoir at the end this statement is that his mom and dad turn a simple house into a home. That statement tells me that the author feels @CAPS1 well he is inside his home or inside a home with his family members. I Also say that the author feels grateful because the great culture and heritage he has came from, which further solidifies the feeling of contentment and appreciation for his upbringing.
167	11993	5	3	I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance in the face of adversity, and I've thanked them repeatedly for all they have endured. They showed me with their lives the importance of resilience and integrity, and these teachings have been the basis of my life.
168	11994	5	3	"In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship, creating a vibrant tapestry of shared experiences. Narciso was proud and grateful to his parents because they gave up everything familiar to come to the United States to give their family a better life, full of opportunities they themselves never had. Without knowing a lot about this new country, they struggled to overcome problems, facing language barriers and cultural differences with unwavering determination. Narciso is grateful to his parents for essentially living their life twice, having the courage to start over in a completely new environment. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" a debt he knew he could only repay by living a life that honored their commitment to his future."
169	11995	5	3	In this memoir the author's mood is satisfied and grateful. He's grateful because his parents came down from Cuba with their newborn to start a new life, and the baby can learn a lot, even though they had to leave behind their friends and family and embrace the challenges of a new country. Their courage and sacrifice provided opportunities he might never have had otherwise, making him appreciate the life he has.
170	11996	5	3	"In this excerpt from the book ""Home: the blue prints of our lives"" Narciso Rodriguez describes his first home in NEW JERSEY. The feeling of this story is first loving with how RODRIGUEZ explains his parents sacrifice ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This story also gave a feeling of closeness and how ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" RODRIGUEZ and his family opened up there house to many people. This story also gave a warm feeling by the story of his family celebrating together in paragraph seven. Overall the story had a happy mood to it showing love, kindness, and what a family should be like. The heartwarming depiction of family and shared experiences leaves the reader with a sense of optimism and appreciation for the simple joys of life."
171	11997	5	3	"In the memoir, Home: Blueprints of our Lives, by Narciso Rodriguez, the author sets a mood of warm, loving, and fun. He paints this picture vividly throughout the memoir. Out of the whole memoir, Narciso talks about how his family moved into a home in Newark, New Jersey, and... ""within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen,"" when you picture that in your mind you create a very warm, tasty, good-smelling room, which helps create a mood for the whole memoir. Another way Narciso creates mood is when he talks about the cuban music flowing through the house, ""Passionate Cuban music...filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" With this he shows that it was fun, warm, inviting, and exciting. The author says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family, and friends, and endless celebrations that encommpassed, both, formed a backdrop, to life in our warm home."" He also creates a mood of fun, warm, entertaining, and loving feeling, by describing parties, celebrations, with friends and family. In this memoir, the author successfully sets a mood of warm, loving, fun, and entertaining, making the reader feel welcomed into his memories."
172	11998	5	3	The mood that the author created was happy. All the people in the story were happy and somewhat sad, experiencing a bittersweet feeling as they navigated through life's ups and downs.
173	11999	5	3	"The mood created by the author was warmthness. He was so affectionate toward his family moving forward, he also cared for his parents alot and what they had done for their family. I know this because ""I will never forget how my parents turn to the simple house into a home"". This quote truly encapsulates the love and appreciation the author feels, solidifying the warm mood conveyed."
174	12000	5	3	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created is described. Starting with the evidence ""my parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956,"" a feeling of determination is evoked. The parents' journey to the United States suggests a strong will to overcome obstacles. Further evidence, ""in 1961, I was born into the simple house, situated in a two-family, blonde-brick building in the @CAPS1 bound section of Newark, New Jersey,"" creates a bittersweet mood. While there is joy associated with birth, the description of the humble setting hints at the family's limited resources. These details collectively contribute to the complex emotional landscape established in the memoir."
175	12001	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was like happiness, and he had a lot of emotion because he really loves his mother, father, and his baby sister. There is lots of emotion because Narciso talks about where he lives and how long he lived in a one-room apartment. The happiness part is when he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a memory that was both happy and sad, showing the complex emotions tied to his upbringing and family."
176	12002	5	3	In the passage, it shows a child growing up in a place that he/she thinks is heaven on earth. The author is trying to show you, when you read this, and feel a sense of him/her being loved and loving where he/she is. The mood it is creating is happiness also, radiating a feeling of contentment and belonging that underscores the idyllic nature of the child's upbringing.
177	12003	5	3	"The mood in this memoir was soft, with an exception. I say that the mood is soft because it has a nice thankful mood that's really telling everyone how grateful he is of his parents and their care. It's also saying that there was racism and segregation, so in that paragraph (which is the exception) the mood is more of a rougher mood, I say rougher as in ""a rough life,"" having to deal with racism and segregation. Back to the soft mood, @PERSON1 also mentions his friend Alegria and her putting meals on the table and having his family there regularly; this reminded me of when someone is going through a tough time and the community helps out by sometimes cooking meals. This was nice of Alegria (@ORGANIZATION1's friend), demonstrating her kindness and generosity. And also, how they would house family until they were back on their feet and having the feeling that their family would do the same for them shows their strong sense of family and mutual support. And lastly, the last sentence of the last paragraph gave the sense of them taking a house and turning it into a home, suggesting warmth and belonging, which would be comforting. These all give off the soft sense, meaning nice and thankful, showcasing the author's appreciation for the support and love he experienced."
178	12004	5	3	The mood in this memoir is happy and joyful. This child that is telling the story is telling about the happy things in their life. They tell about how they were born into a simple house, filled with love and laughter. The heart of their home is the kitchen because they all love to cook and experiment with new recipes together. The family invites many people over to their home to have dinner, sharing their culinary creations and creating a warm, welcoming atmosphere. This child also talks about how grateful they are for their parents, and how they thanked them repeatedly for their unwavering support and affection. They will never forget how their parents turned their simple house into a home, filled with love, delicious food, and cherished memories. So by these examples you can see that the mood of the memoir is happy and joyful, reflecting a childhood filled with warmth and appreciation.
179	12005	5	3	In this memoir there are many different moods that the author tells you about. Happiness is a mood that the author tells you about; they are all happy because they can be together and have a great time, cherishing each other's company. Another mood is caring. Her parents care about others and keep their doors open for them at all times, offering a safe haven. Love is all around this house. They love all their friends and family and celebrate with them no matter what, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. They also show their love by letting people stay with them until they can get back up onto their feet, providing practical support. One mood in this memoir is courage; these two people show courage when they get here, facing new challenges, and they keep that courage for a very long time. Especially when they come from having such great jobs to ones that aren't that great, they display resilience in the face of adversity. The wide range of emotions paints a vivid picture of their lives.
180	12006	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is sad, and happy because he talks about things that happened to his parents and happy things of his parents. I think the author is sad because they died but he could be happy too, remembering the good times. I think I would be sad and happy if my parents died. Thats why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is sad, and happy. My Parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the united states in 1956. In 1961, I was born into this simple house, a fact that likely brings him joy as he reflects on his beginnings.
181	12007	5	3	In this memoir the author creates a clear mood. He keeps stating over and over that he is so grateful for his parents and family members. Also, he describes that his house was always filled with amazing smells and Cuban music. It also says that there was always a feeling of love and happiness in the air which sometimes pushed them through the hard times that they faced, especially when money was tight. Another thing that he says is that even though almost everyone has a different race, everyone got along and helped others out, creating a strong sense of community. And one final way I know he had a happy mood, is that he said everyone was honest and hard working, contributing to a positive and supportive environment. These elements combine to paint a picture of a joyful and appreciative upbringing.
182	12008	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful. The author proved that it doesn't take the amount of money, or how big your house is to be happy. Sometimes its just the simple things. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The author is showing the reader that even though they might not be family by blood, they still treat each other as if they were, which highlights the gratitude for the strong bonds they shared. In the last sentence of the memoir it reads, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows the reader that no house is a home without happy memories and great lessons learned, further emphasizing the author's appreciation for a loving upbringing."
183	12009	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez created a mood of happiness and comfort in the memoir. When he told that ""... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship,"" it signaled to me that they all must be happy together. This sense of unity likely fostered a positive environment. And when Rodriguez describes how all of the Cuban traditions his parents brought blended, it just made me think he was comfortable with his home, a haven where heritage and belonging intertwined. This harmonious blend of cultures undoubtedly contributed to his sense of well-being."
184	12010	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the excerpt from ""Home: The blueprints of our lives"" is very thankful. Phrases like ""and for which I am eternally grateful"" and ""I will always be grateful to my parents,"" which, like these, are scattered throughout the excerpt, show gratefulness and love for his parents. Some other phrases like ""They came selflessly"" and ""... To give their children a better life"" further emphasize this gratitude. Throughout the excerpt, he tries to express how grateful he is to his parents and community. One quote that comes to mind when reading paragraphs one and two is, ""It takes a village to raise a child."" I think that's how Rodriguez's community worked. They weren't just neighbors; they were family, fostering a supportive environment that he clearly appreciates deeply, which is why the overwhelming mood of the piece is one of profound thankfulness."
185	12011	5	3	"The moods created by the author in the memoir are happiness, love, and gratitude. To start, it made me feel happy because of the way he described his house, and how delightful it was. ""Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This quote made me visualize the scene, and I felt happy to think about the beautiful and enjoyable setting. Secondly, it made me feel loving to my loved ones like my family and friends. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance,..."" I love my family, and would be thankful if they tried to bring their home country to the United States (if they were born somewhere else) with them. Finally it makes me feel grateful to my own family, and friends. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I would be grateful also, considering all the things they have done for me. That is how this memoir makes me feel once I read it, showcasing the powerful impact of the author's heartfelt words."
186	12012	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is like a mellowish mood, almost like a fun-loving feeling. The author had literally put himself into the memoir as I read. Paragraph two had used parentheses several times within the text, giving the author's look into his reality. This helped to create a calm, mellow feel. Overall, the mood was fairly simple and fun. In the last sentence, it stated that the author said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" describing how the family did not have much but made the best of what they did have. The last sentence made the whole memoir have a calm, mellowish feel. In conclusion, the author in the memoir had created a mellow feeling throughout the whole memoir, successfully conveying a sense of contentment and appreciation."
187	12013	5	3	"The mood in the excerpt is in between grateful and caring and hard because that's what @PERSON1's mood ended up being. The way it was created was by the type of house he was living in with them and also the people @PERSON1 cared about. Also, another mood is comfortable; for example, when he said, ""I was born in Newark, @LOCATION2, in a simple house,"" explains his mood towards everything, showing contentment with his origins."
188	12014	5	3	"The mood created by the author is a feeling of greatfulness for his parents. Narciso Rodriguez is grateful to his parents for coming to the United States with courage. He realizes that they came to this country to give their children better lives. His parents had no knowledge of the English language. Rodriguez's parents had good jobs in Cuba, and had to start their lives from scratch, all for Narciso. Rodriguez has ""often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" He is grateful to his parents for turning his small house into a home in which family is valued more than materialistic things. The first sentence of paragraph six, Rodriguez states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That is an extremely good indicator that the mood created by the author is a sense of greatfulness for his parents, illustrating the profound impact of their choices on his life."
189	12015	5	3	"The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" creates a very warm, peaceful, and interesting mood. The way the author described the way she used to live makes it seem like she experienced a very loving and peaceful environment. She also creates a Spanish theme to it which I could relate to. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 she says she is very passionate about Cuban music and she's grateful she knows how to cook, further emphasizing her connection to her heritage. She also said in paragraph @NUM2 she will never forget how her parents turned a simple house into a home. That quote truly makes the mood of the memoir loving, highlighting the importance of family and belonging in shaping her identity and experiences. Through these details, the memoir successfully evokes a sense of warmth and tranquility, inviting readers into the author's personal world."
190	12016	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is gratitude, happiness, and remembrance. Narciso is proud and thankful for his parents, for them coming all this way by themselves and having to start their whole lives over: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" They came to @LOCATION1 ""to give their children a better life."" They struggled, taking any job that they could find. They struggled for him, so he wouldn't have to struggle. Narciso admires them for ""their strength and perseverance."" Narciso sets the mood in the memoir as gratefulness to his parents and for all that they have done for him. He is happy with the life they have created for him, and is happy that they have done so well: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Narciso’s reflections reveal how much he cherishes the security and love his parents provided, shaping his own life’s path. Narciso is happy and grateful for his life that he was given by his parents. These feelings of happiness and thankfulness underscore the profound impact of his parents' sacrifices on his life."
191	12017	5	3	The author created a calm mood. Everything he talks about is in the same tone, a gentle and even cadence that permeates the entire piece. When he talks about the kitchen in his home, the heart of so many family gatherings, he also created a happy mood, filled with warmth and the aroma of home-cooked meals. He was calm while talking about the memories in his old home, reflecting on bygone days with a quiet fondness. He stayed calm when he talked about how caring his parents were, their unwavering support a comforting presence in his recollections. Overall, the whole writing maintains this consistent calm mood, offering a serene and peaceful reading experience.
192	12018	5	3	"The @CAPS1 created by the author in this story is a couple different types of moods. One of those moods is a happy and good @CAPS1. One example of this is when the author states ""I Learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That shows a good @CAPS1 because it is about loving. Next example of a happy or good @CAPS1 is when the story states ""Countless extended family members came and whent-and there was often someone staying with us temperally until they were able to get back on there feet."" This shows a happy @CAPS1 because they are welcoming people into there family. Another @CAPS1 in the story is sad. One example is when it says ""Could not afford to move into a moddest three room appartment"" This is a sad @CAPS1 because a you always want the best of for people and if there to poor to afford a good place and that is sad. Also it says ""They struggled both personally and financially. This is a sad @CAPS1 because they are haveing trouble getting by. There is more then @NUM1 @CAPS1 in this story, but the most import @CAPS1 I think is loving. A example of loving is when it states ""all thes cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" That line right there is showing love. That is the most importand @CAPS1 to know in this story, loving, because it highlights the unifying power of human connection despite hardships."
193	12019	5	3	The mood created by the author was initially a medium, normal tune because he was just describing who he was, where he lived, and what his life was like. Then, towards the middle and end, it changed a lot in my perspective. It shifted to a sad tone, reflecting not just a hard life, but also a sense of gratitude. His parents seemed like great people for everything they did with him. I got this impression from the beginning and ending of the story, seeing how sad his life was, but how he seemed to make the best of things, saying he had a good time in all that he did, demonstrating a bittersweet feeling that lingers, showcasing both hardship and appreciation. That's my opinion and answer to the story.
194	12020	5	3	"The mood the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness. The author creates gratefulness by repeatedly saying what his parents gave him and that he is grateful for it. First he talks about how he is grateful his parents got him interested in cooking. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their... love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This shows the author is grateful for his parents showing him to love cooking. Another time the author is grateful is in paragraph @NUM2. It says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He particularly values the sacrifices they made for him. This shows the author is grateful for his parents' endurance to come to @LOCATION1. In conclusion, the mood the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness. He was grateful for his parents giving him all they could."
195	12021	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", tells us of how Narciso Rodriguez grew up with his parents who immigrated from Cuba, the mood created by the author is warm & comforting. For example, the mood is comforting because, Narciso Rodriguez speaks of how his parents created a traditional Cuban home, out of nothing but a one bedroom apartment. Narciso Rodriguez describes his life being centered around the kitchen & his parents always providing what they could the best for him.""Narciso Rodriguez also states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice"". Ive often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing I could ever have done"". This gratitude further emphasizes the loving and supportive atmosphere of his childhood home, solidifying the memoir's overall comforting mood."
196	12022	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy. It made me feel happy because it was good to know that ""'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This meant that all the people around you that care about you are your ""family,"" which is a comforting thought. Another reason why the mood of the memoir is happy is because I think if my parents were in the same situation that Narciso's parents were in, my parents would have done the same thing. My parents would have also wanted, ""to give their children a better life,"" showing a deep sense of love and responsibility. This memoir makes me feel happy because of how caring Narciso's parents were, demonstrating that parental love can overcome significant challenges."
197	12023	5	3	The mood of the memoir is happy. I know this because the Rodriguez family crossed the border from Cuba to the United States to have a better life. They came in 1956, but had to wait until 1970 to be reunited with their Aunts and Uncles. They now have a bigger house with a yard. They are grateful they live in the United States, finding joy and opportunity in their new home.
198	12024	5	3	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by @PERSON1 a mood is created throughout the story. Mood is a feeling displayed to the reader through literature.

In conclusion the memoir ""@PERSON2"" there was a theme of festivity and pride throughout this whole piece of literature."
199	12025	5	3	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, there was only one @LOCATION1 mood I think. The mood I think the author was trying to make people feel is happiness. There are a lot of examples that make me think that. One example that I think is best is the last sentence ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" I think this is the best example of happiness because even though they didn't live in the biggest house, they were still happy with what they had, and this sentiment clearly conveys a sense of contentment. That is what I think the mood created by the author was."
200	12026	5	3	"The mood created in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is a profound sense of closeness and selflessness that so enriched Narciso's childhood. The mood created by Narciso comes from his memoir, in which he lived a poor life, but a life that was enriched by friends and family that had a very close bond, one that overcame racism and tough time. ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The mood created by Narciso displays how his community acted, and shows how close his friends and family were, a bond that defied hardship.

In paragraph @NUM1 it said his parents created his new home to look like a cuban home he had back in cuba by putting cuban thing on the wall. I feel that in this short story he is very grateful because he said in paragraph @NUM2 he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house to a home. This act of love made him feel more settled in a foreign place. @PERSON1 is a very calm and happy short story, demonstrating the strong bond within the family and the boy's appreciation for their efforts in making him feel comfortable.

Narciso mentions how his parents created a home for him even though it meant making many sacrifices. He describes his two-room apartment as a ""traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This quote is important because it begins the explanation of why his house gives him so many warm memories conveyed in his writing. Narciso explains how many people in his neighborhood are immigrants that come together, help one another, and form one big family. ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us.""

In his memoir, he talks about the sacrifices his parents made and how truly grateful he is that his parents moved to New Jersey for a better life for themselves and him, no matter what the cost. His memoir is all about the love for his parents and his gratitude toward them. He really wants people to be able to feel the happiness that he feels when he thinks about his home and his wonderful life that his parents provided for him.

206	12032	5	3	The portrait that the author created in the memoir was an uplifting one. His memoir talked about growing up in the gutter of Newark, New Jersey (which became more of a ghetto), during the time of immigration. His neighborhood was full of Spanish, African American, and Italian immigrants. His family would come over and they would have dinner together, and they would have people stay in their house until they got back on their feet. He had a childhood full of family and friendship, which is great to have and shapes the positive tone of the memoir.
207	12033	5	3	"The mood of the excerpt is very bright. The author describes her risk taking, loving parents. The author describes the many things her parents have given to her. ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home... Both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today... Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" As you can see, the author, Narciso Rodriguez, describes her young life and home with happiness and gratefulness, suggesting a fond remembrance of those early years.

In this case, the author wanted to express joy in her writing."
208	12034	5	3	"The author created a very grateful/happy mood in the memoir. For example in paragraph @NUM1 when Narciso says ""I will always be greatful to my parents for the love and sacrifice."" When he is saying this he is showing he is happy w/ his parents and their dedication to him. In the memoir he talks about how he loves his house and why he loves his house and all the great memories in that house and that shows that this memoir mood is a more happy mood instead of sad for example paragraph @NUM2 when he says ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this combo house were a cuban feast always filled the air with not just sent and music but life and love."" Also when he said in paragraph @NUM2 that"" It here where i learned the real defenition of family. And for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love."" The consistent focus on positive memories and expressions of love and gratitude solidify the overwhelmingly happy and grateful mood of the memoir."
209	12035	5	3	"The mood created by the AUTHOR in the memoir is happy. I think there is happiness because of what it says on paragraph ONE.

In conclusion, that's the mood I think the AUTHOR created and some reasons why."
210	12036	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is interesting. First of all, his parents ""originally from Cuba but arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a furnished one room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old [Organization Name] could afford to move into a modest three-room apartment I would soon call home."" This sets a tone of humble beginnings and aspiration. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" That's how the mood is interesting from the author's creation, suggesting a sense of place rooted in modest circumstances, which is a common theme in many coming-of-age stories."
211	12037	5	3	"The mood in this memoir seems to be a grateful tone. The reason I say that is because Narciso says how grateful he was to have parents that left everything behind so that he could have a better life. He also sounded grateful when he talked about how the Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people in his neighborhood would work together instead of being racist to each other, creating a supportive community. He also mentioned that he learned the meaning of ""family"" while living in that house. By ""family"" he didn't mean blood relative Family. What he means by family is everyone that would come into his apartment and everyone in the building was family too, offering support and companionship. The mood he has while writing the memoir is grateful, reflecting on the sacrifices and connections that shaped his life."
212	12038	5	3	"This memoir created a warm, touching mood while he explained his childhood. I especially think the part when he said, ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" because it shows an overall perspective on a normal day during his childhood. Also, where he states that family ""has nothing to do with being a blood relative"" really makes his memoir interesting because it is also teaching lessons. All in all, this memoir was great, and the warming mood is something that I won't forget, and I hope that I, too, can write a memoir such as heart-warming and interesting as this one."
213	12039	5	3	"The author created a joyful mood. The author said, ""growing up in this environment istilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" He talks about how people are close and they don't have to be related to be considered family, highlighting the strong bonds formed through shared experiences. The author says ""my mother and father had came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" The author is proud of his parents for doing that; that takes a lot of courage, demonstrating admiration for their resilience and determination to build a new life. Ultimately, the author conveys a sense of gratitude and appreciation for the unique upbringing and the values instilled by both his family and the community around him."
214	12040	5	3	The mood created by the speaker is happy because he is talking about starting a new life and how grateful he is for the family he has. The way he expresses happiness is also evident in having his extended family—cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents—by his side. The speaker's living situation also contributes to the happy mood; he loves where he lives and appreciates having his friends and babysitter nearby, knowing they are there for him. That's why I think the mood is happy, as told by the story and the speaker's words.
215	12041	5	3	"In the memoir the author created the mood that Narciso Rodriguez was proud of his Cuban culture and heritage and that family was very important to him because in paragraph @NUM1 ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" so accepted people as family. This suggests Rodriguez's upbringing within the close-knit Cuban community, where bonds extended beyond biological ties, significantly shaped his inclusive perspective on what constitutes family. Ultimately, this nontraditional view of family highlights the profound impact of his cultural background on his personal values."
216	12042	5	3	"The moods created by the author in the story were grateful, reflecting appreciation for the parents' sacrifices for their child. A friendly atmosphere also emerges, emphasized by the presence of ""family"" in the United States who welcomed them with open arms and doors. Courage is another prominent mood, stemming from their perseverance in learning the language and seeking employment despite challenges. The final mood evident in paragraph seven is happiness, as the child cherishes their Cuban heritage, continues to enjoy Cuban music, and embraces their upbringing in the United States, showcasing a blend of cultures that brings joy and fulfillment, completing the emotional landscape of the narrative."
217	12043	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author is happy. He reflects on cherished memories and the strong bonds he shares. The author describes his home is a place for family, a sanctuary filled with warmth and laughter. He is grateful to his parents for everything they did, acknowledging their sacrifices and unwavering support. The author enjoyed his childhood, recalling carefree days filled with joy. He was surrounded by loving people and lots of friends, creating a strong sense of belonging. That is how in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author is happy, a sentiment rooted in a foundation of love and familial connection that has shaped his life."
218	12044	5	3	"The mood of the author is a very gentle yet very happy tone. The reason it's gentle is because he's describing how he grew up and what his life was like. To some people, they could just blab all day, but to most they have to dig through memories so that they can get the scene just right. For example, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" The parts were the mood was very happy was probably parts that he could remember the most with detail. For example, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" The reason that he could remember this more clearly is because he probably cooks for his family using his parents recipes, thus solidifying the happy, gentle memories associated with his upbringing."
219	12045	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is definitely being proud. The reason I think the author is proud is because he explains how he grew up throughout his whole life. Also, growing up made him proud because he came up not having a lot, to being a famous fashion designer. Lastly, this memoir's mood also seems proud because he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home,"" further illustrating his appreciation for his roots and upbringing. All of this points to an author who is genuinely proud of his journey and accomplishments."
220	12046	5	3	The mood that was set in the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez was one of reflection, encouraging the reader to consider their own life and relive cherished experiences, much like the author seemingly does. It evokes a feeling of nostalgia, prompting thoughts of the great times the author has had with family. Ultimately, the passage creates a reflective mood for the reader.
221	12047	5	3	"In ""@PERSON1"" the overall mood created by the author is of gratitude and passion. Throughout the passage the author uses very passionate words such as ""aromas,"" ""endless,"" ""encompassed,"" ""instilled,"" etc. This shows that the author obviously wants to convey a very rich and passionate theme and mood to the memoir. He probably feels very moved and passionate on the subject and wants to convey that to the readers in a subtle way. As a result reader perceive a very rich and passionate mood while reading the memoir. Another element in the passage adds gratitude to the overall mood of the story. The author added bits and pieces of phrases in parentheses that make the reader perceive the author's feeling of gratitude towards his parents. Phrases like ""(and for which I am eternally grateful)"" and ""(which I adore to this day)"" account for the feeling of gratitude the reader perceives. Another way the author created this mood is with a more direct approach by stating ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The phrases and statement show that the author feels very grateful for what his parents have done for him, which create a mood of gratitude. As a result the mood of ""@PERSON1"" is one of passion and gratitude that is shown through the author's choice of words and statements. That is why I would describe the mood of ""@PERSON1"" as being very passionate and full of gratitude."
222	12048	5	3	The memoir's mood is a sense of happiness because it talks about a place where neighbors are like family and everyone is very close. Like how Sergio and @PERSON1 became his surrogate grandparents, when they were people who lived in the basement apartment, offering warmth and guidance. Alegria, his first friend, normally ate dinner with them, further solidifying the feeling of extended kinship. The whole memoir is about how his parents showed him the meaning of family and to be open to friends and neighbors, ultimately demonstrating the profound joy found in community.
223	12049	5	3	"The overall mood created by the author of this memoir is one of complete gratefulness. The author is very, extremely thankful for his parents sacrifice, love, care and selflessness. He also creates a mood of happiness, unity and overall loving, that he has seen throughout his lifetime. The author describes his gratefulness towards his parents by remembering how they had to leave cuba, their native country, friends, family and jobs behind because they wished to give the child they wished for better life opportunities that could only be found in America. He thanks his parents repeatedly throughout the memoir for the love, caring, family, friends and selflessness they brought into his life. He describes situations where his parents had to make new friends and family from around their neighborhood and that from that a sense of love and friendship and unity was found. As his family got larger, the author talks about how his childhood, small, three-room apartment was made into a completed home. When all of these details combined, along with language such as. ""I've thanked them repeatedly,"" a mood and feeling of utter gratefulness is felt throughout the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" showcasing a deep appreciation for the sacrifices and love that shaped his life and career."
224	12050	5	3	The author masterfully crafts a mood of quiet introspection throughout the memoir. They work hard to create this atmosphere, carefully choosing words and imagery that evoke a sense of solitude and contemplation. The deliberate pacing of the narrative further contributes to this feeling, allowing the reader to fully immerse themselves in the author's internal world. This is achieved through detailed descriptions of the natural environment, which often mirror the author's emotional state, and through poignant reflections on past experiences. Ultimately, the author's dedication to establishing this mood of quiet introspection allows for a deeper connection with the reader, inviting them to share in the author's journey of self-discovery and understand the weight of their personal reflections.
225	12051	5	3	"The mood created by the author was a very grateful and happy mood in his memoir. For an example in paragraph six he states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their Love and sacrifice."" This shows how grateful he is to his parents, highlighting the positive impact of their support. He is also grateful to his friends and neighbors; this sentiment is evident in paragraph three when the author says ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows that Narciso Rodriguez values his community and that his neighbors portray a similar happy, grateful, and supportive outlook. Therefore, all of these reasons clearly explain the overall grateful and happy mood that Narciso Rodriguez expresses throughout his memoir."
226	12052	5	3	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by @PERSON1 he describes the mood. The first thing is that the mood is love. For starters he says ""growing up in this envionment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Over here, he is saying that your friends can be your family or the people that you love. Secondly he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. Right here, he is saying that he thanks his parents for the life they had given him. Finally, he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. Here he is saying that ""he will never forget when he was living in a home with family, In conclusion @PERSON1 rodriguez describes the mood but also his childhood when he learned about family."
227	12053	5	3	He/she makes you try to be sad, I don't even know if this is real, but it didn't work. The attempt felt forced and unnatural, ultimately failing to evoke any genuine sorrow.
228	12054	5	3	"The mood created by the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very uplifting and happy. One reason I think the memoir is uplifting and happy is because it talks about how grateful Narciso is of his parents. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I thought that this line was very meaningful and uplifting because he's basically thanking his parents for immigrating and giving him a better life. Another reason I think this article is uplifting and happy is because in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with a blood relative."" I found that uplifting because essentially what he is saying is that family doesn't always mean who you are related to but the people around you that love and support you; this positive outlook contributes to the overall happy tone. Lastly, this article is uplifting because it shows love can make a difference and that gratitude and a broad definition of family are key to a happy life."
229	12055	5	3	"In the memoir the mood that the author created is optimistic in two ways. First was happy for being created and being able to use America's beautiful friendliness. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with blood relatives."" Second was that knowing that if you have hope anything can be achieved. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This hopeful and appreciative tone reflects the author's overall positive perspective."
230	12056	5	3	"In this memoir the author creates a very specific mood that is the same throughout the memoir. The mood of this memoir was a comforting and happy mood. One way that this mood was established was that they talked how their environment showed a great sense of family and when I think of family I see the mood as comforting and happy. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"". This showed the mood because his family always took in people and made them feel welcomed, sharing meals and offering support without hesitation. Another reason the mood was comforting and happy was that it talked about how all of the people were nice and kind to everyone they met. ""It was a close nit community of honest hardworking immigrants who extend a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"". Through these acts of kindness and acceptance, the memoir successfully cultivates an atmosphere of warmth and joy, leaving the reader with a sense of contentment. This is how the memoir showed a happy and comforting mood."
231	12057	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created by the author is together the family is organized. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today; this sharing of responsibilities truly shows how organized the family was. That is the mood that is created by the author in the memoir, highlighting a sense of unity and well-structured family life."
232	12058	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of love and deep appreciation. An example from the text says, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Another example from the text says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" In conclusion, because of his parents' love for him, they sacrificed a lot so he could have a happy and good life, fostering a profound sense of thankfulness and admiration in the author."
233	12059	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful and happy. The reason I say that is because if my parents did that, I would be very grateful because they did all this for me to be happy and for me to have a better life. The author states, ""And for which I am eternally grateful."" They also write, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" Wow, that is a lot from his/her parents; they are very strong, and they did all that for their children to be happy. This is the reason why I picked those two moods in the memoir, as the author’s own words explicitly express thankfulness and appreciation for their parents' sacrifices, leading to an overall feeling of happiness for the opportunities they provided."
234	12060	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is many things. But, I think the main moods in the memoir are happy and greatful. I think the mood of the story is happy because the story tells about all the good times @PERSON1 had in his house. For example, @PERSON1 says ""here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" And, I think the mood of the story is also thankful because a lot of the story has to do with @PERSON1 thanking his parents for all they have done and sacrificed for him. For example, in the end of the memoir @PERSON1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" and in a way thanks his parents for everything, demonstrating the deep appreciation felt. So, as you can see those are the moods I think the author created in the memoir."
235	12061	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir is very homebound. How the parents turned the ""simple house"" into the ""traditional Cuban home"" was shocking. The parents played the ""Passionate Cuban music,"" and ""a love of cooking"" helped create a family mood, and it showed how much they love their heritage. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This family loved spending time with each other and celebrating. Overall, the mood is loving, happy, and caring, highlighting the strong bonds formed through shared experiences and cultural pride."
236	12062	5	3	"The mood I felt when I read the @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez was a feeling of togetherness. I got this mood because he is always talking about being together with his family and how the home he was brought up in truly brought everyone in his family together, something that visibly resonated with him, and this made him proud of his family and his Cuban Culture. His family meant a lot to him so another mood could be love because of his love for his family and the house he grew up in where he learned to love and appreciate his heritage. His parents did a lot for him and, ""Turned their simple house into a home"", fostering a nurturing environment. He learned everything he could ever think about from his parents, absorbing their wisdom and values, and he loves them a lot. These are the moods I felt while reading about Narciso Rodriguez and the profound impact his upbringing had on him."
237	12063	5	3	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, @CAPS1 created a certain mood. Narciso Rodriguez created a gentle mood that stayed constant. @CAPS1 tells how his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family."" Which means @CAPS1 probably grew up in a life without very much violence. @CAPS1 also says that @CAPS1 ""will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 wants his parents to know that @CAPS1 loves them very much and lets them know by thinking them. Lastly @CAPS1 says @CAPS1 ""will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The sense of gentleness stays throughout the whole memoir because @CAPS1 is always saying the good things about his life, not the bad, highlighting the positive aspects and familial love that shaped his experiences."
238	12064	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy. First thing that shows the mood is happy of this memoir is when the author wrote ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)"" that meant that she really love her culture music. Another thing is when she said ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" and for that to be true you don't have to be related to someone who really love you; to say that he/she is part of your family is just enough that he/she love and care about you like you for him/her. Last thing is when the author said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" that meant that she will never forget that her family began so small and then turn big because their family went to their house and they stared their new life in the house, which ultimately shows her happiness about her upbringing."
239	12065	5	3	The mood created in the memoir is the feeling of Cuban culture and the AUTHOR's home. The feeling could be described as homey. In paragraph ONE, this is where the AUTHOR first introduces the custom of his house and how it is. The AUTHOR describes his house as simple with Cuban music and the scent of Cuban food flowing through it. The feeling that the AUTHOR uses to describe his house is the feeling that the whole memoir had; the house kinda flooded the memoir with its feelings. Also, this memoir didn't only show Cuban feeling; it also gave off family vibes (like how a family is happy and together). It expressed how the AUTHOR was close to his family, which further enhances the warm and comforting atmosphere that permeates the entire memoir.
240	12066	5	3	The mood in the memories is tinged with a bittersweet nostalgia. A sense of longing permeates the recollection of past events, colored by the awareness that those moments are irretrievably gone. It's a gentle sadness interwoven with appreciation for the experiences lived, creating a complex emotional tapestry. The author's tone suggests a reflective contemplation, a turning inward to examine the significance of what has been. This introspective gaze acknowledges both the joy and the pain inherent in the passage of time, ultimately leading to a deeper understanding of the self and its journey. The overall feeling suggests a fondness mixed with regret, leading to a poignant acceptance of the past and its indelible mark.
241	12067	5	3	The author was @CAPS2 nostalgic, likely describing his happy @CAPS1 childhood. Because in the memair it was talking about how he loved his home and his parents’ cooking and music, he was @CAPS2 grateful for his parents' caring and selflessness. He liked how his home was a community for Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. Thinking back to his memorable birthdays and feasts made him happy, reflecting a sense of warm appreciation for his upbringing and heritage.
242	12068	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso projects a very grateful, thankful + optimistic mood. Every sentence, he thanks a specific person for bringing such greatness to his life. In paragraph six, Narciso says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and it shows that Narciso is very grateful towards his parents, for bringing him to America, and him being who he is today, + who he was. Narciso also projected off a happy and thankful tone. He felt that his life was made so much better in America, than it would've or could've been in Cuba. Lastly, Narciso appears to be optimistic. Although he came from a little two-family home, he was still very hopeful about how his life would be better in America, and thanks his parents for their generous sacrifice that allowed him to pursue his dreams. In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" Narciso appears to be a grateful, thankful + optimistic man."
243	12069	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is both happy and uplifting but also sad. The examples of how it is happy are the way the author describes in paragraph @NUM1 how his parents were able to afford to move into a better and larger house, ""twenty-one-year-old @PERSON2 and twenty-seven-year-old Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, @NUM2-room apartment."" Another example of the happiness is when he is describing the time when his parents were decorating the appartment to look like a traditional-cuban home, ""Within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" Another example of happiness is when he describes his community of united and hard-working immigrants, ""In our neighborhood all of those cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" And the final example is when he mentions that lot's of his family and friends grace their kitchen table more times than not. The mood changes about halfway through the memoir in paragraph @NUM3 when it says, ""Even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and carrers in the country they loved."" This is when the parents are leaving Cuba and their families and friends to take on a life in @LOCATION1. Another example of sadness is when it says ""The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" This means that the parents will have a much harder time finding jobs in @LOCATION1, and they might not get the pay they deserve. These are the various moods set by the author in this memoir, showing a complex picture of both joy and sorrow intertwined with the immigrant experience."
244	12070	5	3	"The mood described by the author in the memoir is a grateful and happy feeling. I say this because the main character, Narciso Rodriguez, always brings up how he is grateful for his parents helping him in his childhood. In paragraph 1, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also, the mood is a happy mood. I think this because the story states, ""At a time when overt racism was the norm... All of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" Even though there is racism, everyone is friends, creating a sense of joy amidst adversity, further solidifying the happy and grateful tone that permeates the memoir."
245	12071	5	3	"The overall mood in Narciso's memoir is admiration and gratefulness towards his parents. He expresses his gratitude several times. Like on paragraph @NUM1. It says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" He clearly recognizes the magnitude of their sacrifice. All of paragraph @NUM1 is about how grateful he is to his parents. Another example of his gratitude towards his parents is on paragraph @NUM3. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done"" Also all of paragraph @NUM3 is about his admiration towards his parents and the immense respect he holds for their choices. So, the mood in the memoir was love, towards his parents, showing a deep appreciation for their selfless actions."
246	12072	5	3	"In the non--fiction memoir ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso talks about his life growing up, his home, and the people around him. The author considered his neighbors family also, rather than just his parents and brothers and sisters. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative... a close knit community."" (par @NUM1) This gives the memoir a friendly mood, it shows that the author loved his whole neighborhood. The author also invited his neighbors into his home and was very close to them. ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria... lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table... more often than not. Also at the table... my surrogate grandparents."" (par @NUM2) This gives the memoir an inviting mood, the author always had friends and neighbors over for dinner. The author also talks about how grateful he is for his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" (par @NUM3) this gives the memoir a sweet mood, the author shows his happiness and gratefulness for everything his parents had done for him. He appreciates the sacrifices they made to provide for him and his siblings. In conclusion the authors sets a very sweet, inviting mood, by adding details of how joyful, and enjoyable his childhood was."
247	12073	5	3	The mood the author has is good. He's very proud of how he lives. The most important thing that matters in his life is family. His family cares a lot and watches over him no matter what, and he is very thankful for all of their support and love, which makes him feel secure and content.
248	12074	5	3	The mood created by the author was a warm and comforting feeling. He talked about his family life and that his parents had to give up everything they had in Cuba to come here and start over again. Despite the hardships, he makes everything sound really nice with everyone crowded in the dining room to eat, sharing stories and laughter, a testament to their resilience and close bond.
249	12075	5	3	The mood created in this memoir is comfort. To me it is so comforting because it is such a happy memoir, where these two young people invite other people over their house all the time. They also let people stay until they are able to get back on their feet, offering a warm and supportive environment. There is not one ounce of sadness to me, just a happy and inviting family which comforts me. Another thing is the lifestyle, radiating a sense of belonging. I love how they are proud of their Cuban heritage. They listen to their Cuban music and always cook their Cuban food, sharing their culture with everyone. I love it when people are not afraid to be themselves. It comforts me knowing everyone is happy, and the memoir's emphasis on joy and acceptance truly makes it a comforting read. That is why the mood created in this memoir to me is comfort.
250	12076	5	3	The mood created by the author was grateful and happy. The author was explaining what the boy in the memoir was feeling and felt. The boy thought that his parents were really great and he thought that he could never be like them. He was also grateful that he had house and parents like you did. He admired his parents and what they did. He will never forget growing up and living in that house. The purpose of the author was to show you how grateful someone was of what there parents did when they immagrated from Cuba to Miami. Their sacrifices and dedication to building a new life resonated deeply with him. The boy's immense appreciation highlights the powerful impact of his parents' journey and his enduring connection to his childhood home.
251	12077	5	3	"There was a mood created by the author in @CAPS1's memoir. Here are some points to help support this parenthesis identify a new mood, his gratefulness, and his view on things. First, parenthesis identify a new mood. When it goes from sentence to parenthesis the new mood appears then it goes back. Here is my reason why the story, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with aromas of the kitchen."" @CAPS2, his gratefulness, is evident throughout the memoir. @CAPS1 is very grateful for how things turned out. Here another reason why from the story: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS3, his view on things, reflects a positive outlook shaped by his experiences. @CAPS1 had very fortunate times in his eyes. Ultimately these were my reasons for the mood that was created by the author parenthesis, gratefulness, and his perspective, showcasing a life appreciated and cherished."
252	12078	5	3	"The mood of the author in the memoir is very happy. I think it sounds like the child of the grateful family is talking, and she is one of the most grateful people I ever read about because she says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house to a home."" This sentiment clearly shows her appreciation and contributes to the overall joyful tone, highlighting the positive impact her upbringing had on her life and shaping her into someone who values family and home."
253	12079	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a truly original mood in the excerpt. I would say he puts a kind of grateful mood in the excerpt. He is constantly stating how grateful he is toward his parents for their selflessness, and courage. One example of Narciso creating a grateful mood is when he says: ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This quote shows how much gratitude Narciso actually has for his parents. Another example where Narciso shows tremendous gratitude is when he says: ""they came, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" In this quotation, Rodriguez shows that he knows what it took to come here, he knows the losses that his parents went through, and for that he is truly grateful, which establishes the overall grateful tone."
254	12080	5	3	"I believe that the mood created by the author is happy and loving. In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 not only the people blood related to you is your family but also friends and anyone close to you, which shows an inclusive and accepting atmosphere. The excerpt also states ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" This shows the love that everyone has for one another and the joyful beginnings in a new land. Lastly the excerpt states ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of family."" This part makes you feel warm and happy about family, highlighting the central role of shared experiences and cultural traditions in fostering strong bonds. Therefore, the author successfully conveys a sense of happiness and love through these vivid descriptions of family and community."
255	12081	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the author creates a variety of different moods throughout the memoir. In paragraph two the author tells how much culture was put into his home ""my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" He also tells how thankful he is that his parents instilled him a love of cooking and Cuban music. This gives you a feeling of the home being warm, comfortable, and most of all alive. In paragraph three the author tells how a family has nothing to do with blood relatives. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Throughout the memoir you really start to see the author's opinion of the definition of home and family. In paragraph six you see how grateful the author is towards his parents, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" It gives a mood of gratefulness. In paragraph three and four the author talks about the sense of unity and how his parents would always have their door open to people in need and how the whole community was like a family ""cultures came together a great solidarity and friendship."" ""My parents always kept their arms and door open to many people we considered family..."" The general mood of this is all the moods coming together to create a general sense of home and community, ultimately shaping the author's perspective and values."
256	12082	5	3	"People make sacrifices for the ones they love. That is called being selfless. In the story, Narciso's parents are selfless. They left their family and friends to give their son a better life. The author makes an enjoyable and heartwarming mood. Narciso is very grateful. He said he has ""learned the definition of 'family' "". His parents wanted a better life for him. They gave up a lot and he recognizes that. Rodriguez realized his parents were very hardworking. He respected his parents and loved them for everything they have done for him. ""I often tell them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" It's a great feeling knowing someone will do anything for you. Family is very important. @PERSON1 mentioned how his neighbors were all immigrants. They had left their family, too; and only had each other. Knowing you have people who are like family is incredible. Although they can never replace blood relatives, friends are the next best thing. I think growing up, @PERSON1 learned two very important lessons: put others before yourself, and work hard. It is clear that these lessons, learned through observing the sacrifices and support within immigrant communities, shaped @PERSON1's perspective and understanding of what truly matters in life."
257	12083	5	3	The story the author created is sentimental, sad but happy at the same time. I think the story is mostly sentimental because the family moves to New York and kind of looks back to good memories that happened in Cuba, highlighting a deep longing for their past.
258	12084	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives has a happy mood. The author talks about ""passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" in paragraph @NUM1, which makes the house seem very happy and joyful. In paragraph @NUM1, the author also says ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home the very heart of our kitchen,"" this makes the author seem very happy since they like to cook and gather in the kitchen. Narciso Rodriguez talks about ""it was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and @CAPS1 celebrated my first birthdays,"" the mood here seems that everybody liked to come to this house and celebrate important milestones together. This whole memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" makes the mood seem very happy and warm, ultimately creating a sense of nostalgia and appreciation for the author's upbringing."
259	12085	5	3	"The mood of this memoir created by the author is a grateful and thankful one. The mood is grateful because in the initial paragraphs, the author reflects on their humble home and severely lower-class existence, far from the average middle-class life. However, throughout the excerpt, it's emphasized how whatever they lacked materially, they compensated for with the unity of their extended ""family."" By family, it means the immigrant community who came together as one, supporting each other. Narciso recalls that even though his family had very little, they would always share everything they had with anyone in need. By following this example, primarily set by his parents, he learned invaluable life lessons, and he is forever thankful and grateful to his parents for showing him this way of life, shaping his values and perspective."
260	12086	5	3	"The mood created by the memoir is shown by many things. Through positive words, often mentioned thankfulness, and a cosy setting, a happy positive mood is shown. Positive words are often mentioned in the article for example ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people,"" in this the words honest, hardworking, and the phrase ""extended a hand,"" (which means offered help) all invoke a happy mood. The author's constant thanking of things, like as the memoir states ""(and for which I am eternally thankful)"", gives a happy mood because people are only thankful for positive things. Finally this positive mood is shown through setting, which sounds happy and is described as nice, as the memoir states ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This description of the setting shows a clear happy, cosy, positive mood. The mood created by the memoir is happy, positive, and nice because the memoir is worded with positive words, has often mentioned thankfulness, and has a nice setting, all contributing to an overall feeling of warmth and contentment."
261	12087	5	3	The mood in the memoir is calm and thankful. The calmness is because there are no conflicts, replaced instead by a reflective tone. The thankful part is he keeps thanking his parents for making the sacrifice, acknowledging the hardships they endured. How they did it for the next generations cultivates a deep sense of gratitude that permeates the narrative, highlighting the enduring impact of their choices.
262	12088	5	3	Before reading about @PERSON1 I don't think I read about anyone who is more happy than @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is very happy about being an @CAPS1 citizen and still be very happy of having another country's background (in this case Cuba). @PERSON1 was blessed that he had his house. It was in a great neighborhood and the kitchen was the main place of the house. @PERSON1 was very proud of where he lived even though his house was not a mansion or even close to a big house. @PERSON1 was very happy about his parents, most of all. Without his parents he would have lived in Cuba and would not have known his great neighborhood and all of his family and friends, a reality he appreciates deeply.
263	12089	5	3	The mood created by the author is how much the author misses his or her home and where she or he was born and raised. I think the author misses that place more than ever and that she or he wants that *feeling* back. The author will never forget what happened and what the author did and *experienced* in that house, solidifying the sense of longing and remembrance.
264	12090	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, Narciso Rodriguez talks about what he thinks the definition of ""family"" is. He is very specific in that he believes ""family"" doesn't mean blood relatives, ""family"" is about friends and family coming together to form a community. Where everyone helps everyone and everyone is treated fairly and with respect. He sets a very specific mood in this memoir which is everyone coming together, illustrating this with vivid descriptions of shared meals and open doors. That sense of happiness and fullness one might get after doing something good for someone else. Narciso Rodriguez talks about how his dinner table is always full of family and sometimes friends, a testament to the bonds he cherishes. That his family's door is always open to people who need help, creating a haven for those seeking support. When you read his memoir, you really understand what ""family"" really is: the feeling of love, open-ness, willingness, and happiness. you get helping other people and being around people you love and who love you. The mood Narciso Rodriguez sets in this memoir is very powerful in that it really makes people stop and think, prompting a reevaluation of what truly constitutes a family bond. Ultimately, Rodriguez paints a compelling portrait of family as a chosen network of mutual care and affection, a community built on shared experiences and unwavering support."
265	12091	5	3	"In the memoir the author creates a happy mood. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez talks about what he enjoyed and is thankful for from his childhood. He does this by talking about how his kitchen table was surronded by his ""family"". Or as he say ""countloss extended family members cane and went."" This shows that there were always people around, creating a sense of warmth and connection. He also says how he is thankful for how his parents came to the United States ""to give their children a better life"". Finally he says he is greatful to his parents, stating, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrife."" Ultimately, in the memoir the author creates a happy mood by talking about his childhood surronded by family and thankes his parents for there sacrifeces they made to give him a betters life, thus highlighting the importance of family and gratitude in shaping his positive outlook."
266	12092	5	3	There is a good mood to this story. The mood is a warm, happy feeling. When you read the book it makes you feel comfortable. Just like being at your own home, but only a little different. This time you are reading a book. It really explains what is going on and also gives a lot of past information, which I like in a book. But Sonia seemed to really enjoy being Cuban. People seemed to really like her Cuban food, and her family was good people. The neighborhood was a bad place when Sonia was growing up as a child because of racism and segregation, but otherwise, Sonia has a good life, showing resilience and the ability to find joy even amidst challenges.
267	12093	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is love. I think the mood is love because he talks about the love and support his whole family had. One example is when he says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This sacrifice speaks volumes about their devotion. To me that is saying how his parents loved him so much (even though he was not born yet) that they sacrificed everything they had for their children. This profound act of giving truly illustrates a deep familial love, and that is why I think the mood is love."
268	12094	5	3	"The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""The Blueprints of Our Lives"" evokes a happy and positive mood, reflecting strong familial and friendly bonds. For example, the family's move from Cuba, away from relatives, was undertaken for the children's better future. This act highlights a selfless and supportive spirit, as the parents prioritized their children's new life in New Jersey and dedicated themselves to creating a home for them, demonstrating the core mood of the memoir."
269	12095	5	3	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, he feels a great amount of passion and love. He goes into detail about his culture, and says how much it means to him. He also feels love, love for his family and friends who were always there for him. He says that family goes further than blood, highlighting the deep bonds he forged with those who supported his journey and understood his vision. This affection and cultural pride are central to understanding Rodriguez's perspective and creative drive.
270	12096	5	3	The mood of the story is somewhat sad and somewhat happy. It's sad because he comes from a not wealthy family and were immigrants, facing the struggles that often accompany such circumstances. But it's happy because he finally knows the meaning of family and the deep connection they share, discovering joy amidst hardship; this blend creates the complex and poignant moods of the story.
271	12097	5	3	I think the mood is a very happy, grateful mood. The speaker seems very happy with her life and how it was growing up. Narciso seems very grateful for her parents and everybody around her and her whole life growing up. Also about how her neighborhood was. How everybody was happy and were all friends and how there were a lot of immigrants in her neighborhood, further emphasizing a sense of community and shared experiences. This overall feeling of happiness and gratitude paints a picture of a fulfilling and positive upbringing.
272	12098	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is elated. One reason is because ""My parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This seems very happy because moving from your country can be hard. His parents bringing a piece of Cuba with them fostered a sense of joy and connection to their roots. It is clear the author felt happy. That is the reason the mood is elated."
273	12099	5	3	"In this memoir, the author creates a very calming and relaxing mood. The author talked about how family isn't about blood, and how a house doesn't have to be spectacular to be a home. The author said in the memoir ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This basically means that with all the love and care his parents had toward him and his neighbors, created a great place to live, full of warmth and acceptance. The mood also very hopefull. This is because the author's parents came to america with nothing, but with all their hard work, they over came their struggles and helped everyone else in their neighborhood, showing that perseverance and kindness can lead to a better future. Another mood the story had was a loving mood, because even though his neighbors weren't his blood relatives, he loved them as if they were, forging strong bonds of community and mutual support. Ultimately, the memoir's success lies in its ability to evoke these emotions, leaving the reader with a sense of peace, hope, and the understanding that love can transform even the most ordinary circumstances."
274	12100	5	3	"In 1956 Narciso Rodriguez's parents arrived in the United States and bought a two-room apartment. In 1961 Narciso was born and here began his life. In this story Narciso describes his childhood. The home was very lively; it was a traditional Cuban home that consisted of a kitchen that was the heart of the home. Both of his parents loved to cook and listened to Cuban music. Narciso says ""The passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" Narciso also got a good sense of family, and it was not just those who were related to you but also those who cared for you. Although people were different (customs or cultures), they still all came together. People often came to Narciso's home and let them stay while getting back to life because they believed in doing so for one another. Narciso was extremely grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. They taught Narciso about the true meaning of love and family; they also created a home with memories Narciso will never forget, ultimately shaping the person he would become."
275	12101	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very soft and compassionate. The reason I would describe the mood as soft and compassionate is: when Narciso Rodriguez describes growing up with his parents and in Cuba, he never mentioned anything about what he hated about his family and about living in Cuba. Yet he describes all of what he loved about growing up as a child; for example, he says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows that just because you're not related by blood doesn't mean you're not family, highlighting the importance of love and connection over biological ties. Another reason why I would describe the mood of the author as soft and compassionate is at the end of the memoir Narciso Rodriguez says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" showcasing deep gratitude and affection for his upbringing. In conclusion, these expressions of love, gratitude, and emphasis on chosen family are the ways I would describe the mood created by the author as soft and compassionate."
276	12102	5	3	"The mood that the author created in the memoir was grateful and happy for what he had. The author values relationships and he is grateful to have his "" family"". He says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly spanish, cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1"". In other words he is saying that he is lucky to have what he has, a ""family"". Being lucky for what you have also is a synonym for grateful, meaning that the mood of this memoir was grateful. He also said that his family kept an open door and open arms, showing that they would give some of what they had to other people, showing that they knew that others had less, and that they were grateful for what they had. Because the author emphasizes the positive aspects of his upbringing and the strong bonds within his community, it further reinforces the overall feeling of thankfulness. Mood, means tone or a feeling, so the mood of this was grateful and happy."
277	12103	5	3	"In this memoir by @PERSON1 he sets the overall mood for his ""definition of family"". Rodriguez's parents are Cuban immigrants and they live in a community full of all different ethnic groups. ""Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants"" form their community. The Rodriguez family was enormous and their doors were open to anyone who needed assistance. The table was always full for dinner at their house. The mood set was one of very kind and helpful personalities. Families are bigger than just ""blood relatives"" they are the people who you care about and help, or who help you. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" Rodriguez recounts, emphasizing the warmth and generosity that defined his upbringing. This illustrates that family extends beyond kinship, encompassing those individuals who provide support and love."
278	12104	5	3	"In this memoir the author creates a mood of gratitude. To support a claim like this I will provide evidence. It says in the article that ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This clearly shows how the author is trying to create a mood of gratitude. His gratitude is being showed towards his parents. Also it says that ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do to give their children a better life."" This shows how the family leaves their comfort for a troublesome life for their children, thus making the children very grateful. The author's acknowledgement of his parents' selfless actions reinforces this feeling of thankfulness. The mood created by the author is gratefulness and is shown throughout the whole memoir, ultimately shaping the reader's understanding of the author's deep appreciation."
279	12105	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author creates a mood. First, the author shows feelings in this part: ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" The author shows a feeling of a warm, wonderful household with music and cooking, suggesting a vibrant and loving atmosphere. Next, the author shows a feeling of a nice warm childhood here: ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The author enjoyed a nice childhood, filled with friends and family, all enjoying the wonders of their home, further solidifying the image of a happy and nurturing upbringing. This use of vivid sensory details and heartfelt descriptions effectively sets the mood."
280	12106	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and loving mood. It sets a loving mood when the author says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This sets a loving mood because the author is pretty much saying that a person can be so close to you and love you that you consider them family even though you are really not even related, highlighting the importance of connection over blood. It also sets a happy and loving mood when the author says, ""They came selflessly, as immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote shows that Narciso's parents love their children so much that they wanted them to have better lives and to be happy, willing to sacrifice their own comfort for their children's future. That is the mood created by the author in this memoir, one filled with love and appreciation for family, both chosen and biological."
281	12107	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was grateful because Narciso is glad to be in @LOCATION1 with his family. In paragraph @NUM1 lines @NUM2-. ""I will always be greatful to my parents for thier love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more a courageous thing then I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This sentiment underscores the profound appreciation the author feels, solidifying why the mood created by the author in the memoir was one of gratitude."
282	12108	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways. First, the author's mood is, I think, gratitude, for example, ""(and for which I am each currently grateful)... (Which I adore to this day)."" Second, the mood of the author is appreciation. For example, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Another mood of the author is definitely love. I know this because he talks about love and his family and friends a lot. For example, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" In conclusion, the author's moods can be described in many different ways, but gratitude, appreciation, and love are certainly prominent."
283	12109	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir is happy and warm. It starts by talking of things Narciso learned in the home, including Cuban music ""which I open a door to this day."" As well as the culinary skills, ""I am eternally grateful."" Narciso is happy, therefore the mood is happy and reflects a sense of thankfulness. Also, Narciso talks about the great community. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand..."" Narciso goes into great detail describing the good things, like the supportive nature of the community. The author also describes the selflessness of many immigrants including her parents. ""They came selflessly... to give their children a better life."" Narciso Rodriguez describes many positive effects of her parents as immigrants, highlighting their sacrifices. As a result of all this positivity and gratitude, a happy and appreciative mood is effectively created throughout the memoir."
284	12110	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the author created a happy tone throughout the whole story. Narcisco talked about how when he moved to New York City he moved into a three-bedroom apartment. He brought with him the love of cooking. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" Narciso was very grateful that his parents came to New York City to help him make his home seem more like a traditional Cuban home. ""It was a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"", and for that I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" demonstrating the deep appreciation he held for his upbringing and the values it instilled in him."
285	12111	5	3	The mood of the story is like a sad story then it leads to a happy ending. It starts sad because the family moves from Cuba to the United States. They know nothing about the language or the traditions. It gets happier when they move into the apartment, and they find a job to work at. That's what the mood of the story is, going from a place of uncertainty and sadness to one of hope and eventual happiness.
286	12112	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very sad, loving, caring. @CAPS2 @NUM1 states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice; I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could of ever done."" @CAPS1 he is very respectful to his parents, thanks them for making a great life for him. Also in @CAPS2 @NUM1 states ""They showned me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" @CAPS1 whatever occurs you always go back to your roots, remembering the lessons learned. And how important family, and friends are, as they shape who you become. The real @CAPS1 of ""family"" through this kids eyes, highlighting the profound impact of familial love and guidance. Ultimately, the author conveys a deep appreciation for the values instilled by his parents, shaping his worldview and emphasizing the enduring significance of family bonds."
287	12113	5	3	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Narciso Rodriguez, I believe that the author is trying to re-create his past in a way that teaches the reader a few important life lessons about home and family, such as ""It was here I learned the real meaning of family, and that you can turn a simple house into a home."" He achieves this by carefully depicting the warmth and support he received, showcasing how those formative years shaped his values and perspective, thus highlighting the profound impact of a nurturing environment. Ultimately, Rodriguez demonstrates how a strong family foundation provides the bedrock for personal growth and success."
288	12114	5	3	"""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is a sad story. The mood the author is putting sad and happy stories at the same time. One example is when his parents left from Cuba for his son's own sake for a better place. His parents had great jobs in Cuba. His mother was a Chemical organization and his father worked in a laboratory. ""In Cuba, he had worked in a laboratory and she had studied chemical engineering."" The author's mood of this story is sad, showing the sacrifice and loss alongside the hope for a brighter future."
289	12115	5	3	He was thankful his parents moved for him and thinks it was very nice of them. He said he doesn't think he would do that, leave everything behind, so it was especially meaningful to him. His parents had come to give him a better life, a future with more opportunities, even though they were leaving behind loved ones, their own friends and family, to make that sacrifice.
290	12116	5	3	"In the memoir of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" there are two contradicting moods. From chapters one to six Narciso said ""that all cultures came together in solidarity and friendship"" in his neighborhood. Rodriguez describes in-depth as well. He mentioned Cuban cooking and music, not a single detail was left out. There was so much happiness and bliss at the beginning, but it's soon faded as Narciso spoke of his parents. Narciso's parents, Narciso and Maria, both sacrificed their lives to live in America. ""In Cuba, Narciso and Maria worked first class careers, but it was the exact opposite in America."" They would take any job they could find. This mood quickly fades away as Rodriguez describes his gratefulness to his parents. Narciso is very lucky to have parents like Narciso and Maria to watch over him, demonstrating the resilience and love that ultimately shaped his life."
291	12117	5	3	"According to the memoir the mood created by the author is he is thankful for everything his parents have gave him. For example, he states in paragraph @NUM1 ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso always told his parents how greatful his is for them. But Narciso says ""But in reality there is no way to express my gratitude."" He feels that words alone cannot encompass the depth of his appreciation. Therefore, his actions and dedication to honoring their legacy serve as a more profound testament to his thankfulness."
292	12118	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy, showcasing cherished family memories at one house. As it says in the memoir, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" highlighting the transformation from a mere structure to a place filled with love and history. It's conveying the idea that a house is just a building, but a home is where you live, grow up, and create lasting memories, making it a truly special and better place, filled with warmth and significance."
293	12119	5	3	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by The Blueprints of Our lives, the mood created by the author is happyness. The mood in the memoir was happyness. It because the mother showed he how to love people. Quote she said... Always filled the air with not just scent an music but life and love. It was there I learned the real difinition of ""family."" That many family is just not the people you love and not being a blood relative. I like when her mom let anybody to there household to the table. In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the mood that is created by the author is also one of happiness, stemming from similar themes of acceptance and love. These shared sentiments highlight the profound impact of familial love on shaping one's outlook and sense of belonging, resulting in a pervading feeling of joy throughout the narratives."
294	12120	5	3	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives*, Narciso Rodriguez creates a feeling of warmth and connection through his descriptions of home life. Narciso talks about life at home and about his parents' cooking. He is grateful for his parents' cooking and how he learned from them. In paragraph three it states, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows that he considered people around him family and not just his blood relatives. He shows this by talking about how his surrogate grandparents lived in the basement, and he didn't know his real grandparents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba. He expresses deep gratitude for his parents' love and sacrifice, emphasizing the importance of these values. The whole memoir, centered around love and family, therefore sets a positive and appreciative mood for the reader."
295	12121	5	3	The mood in the memoir is very calm. It's not very tense and depressing. An example of it being calm is in paragraph @NUM1 when the words are in the parentheses it's like the person is talking to you, creating a sense of intimacy and ease. Also how it just states facts and a @CAPS1, unemotionally relaying information. Another example of it being calm is how the @CAPS1 is happy and not sad, contributing to the overall tranquil feeling. It has a flow to it, making the reading experience smooth and peaceful. This consistent calmness throughout the memoir allows the reader to engage with the narrative without feeling overwhelmed by negative emotions, ultimately fostering a more relaxed and receptive understanding of the story being told.
296	12122	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Narciso, shows mood. In the first paragraph, it talks of where he comes from. ""My parents originally came from Cuba..."" It starts with a calm mood. In the third paragraph states what it was like in United States. ""Our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants..."" It states that new life in the United States is liked, and how it's put together, comfortably. In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" by Narciso shows mood in different places, ultimately reflecting a sense of belonging and contentment."
297	12123	5	3	The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very touching. The memoir explains how as a kid he didn't have much growing up, but he did have family and he was extremely grateful and proud of his parents for their efforts to start a new family in a different country without knowing the language. When I hear about someone being that **GRATEFUL**, it makes me think how times have changed from when Narciso was growing up in the **1960**'s. He was so grateful and happy when compared to now, even though he had nothing materially. But he was able to show all his gratitude with the deepest heartwarming sympathy; all in all, **Narciso** learned from his parents and knew that family was the most important thing you can have, a value which shaped his life and career.
298	12124	5	3	This memoirs mood is fairly consistent throughout the whole piece. This story is about how @PERSON1's parents created a home. His parents put love, unity, kindness and happiness in their home. He is thanking his parents for being brave and coming to @LOCATION1 with little and creating a foundation for their future life together. He's thanking them for making their simple house into a loving home filled with warmth. The mood of this piece is graciousness and happiness. He is gracious towards his parents for being courageous and making them a home where they could thrive. During this piece he is happy that his parents were brave and came to @LOCATION1, that is why this memoir also has a happy mood, reflecting gratitude and appreciation for their sacrifices and the nurturing environment they cultivated.
299	12125	5	3	"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very loving and caring mood. Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez can't stress enough how much love, gratefulness, and respect HE has towards his parents. For example in paragraph 1, Narciso Rodriguez says ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice"", meaning the sacrifices parents made for their children. HE also says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance... but, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for their spirit and generosity..."" He cares about the lessons his parents taught him so much, that he bases his life on them and will never forget them. But perhaps the most important thing Rodriguez says in this memoir is in paragraph 2, when HE says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This sums up everything his parents taught and sacrificed for him, giving this simple sentence a great meaning, highlighting the profound impact of their love and dedication, and ultimately solidifying the loving and caring mood that permeates the entire memoir."
300	12126	5	3	"Throughout the memoir *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives*, Narciso Rodriguez portrays a mood of happiness and thankfulness towards his parents. Rodriguez writes ""and for which I am eternally grateful"" (@NUM1). Narciso Rodriguez is expressing his thankfulness to his parents for the wonderful things they have taught him such as cooking. Another way this mood of happiness is portrayed is through his writing about people coming together. He writes ""all of these cultures came together showing great solidarity and friendship."" (@NUM2). He is happy and thankful for the connections he made with people of different cultures, and ethnicities. Despite the racism going on in the places around them, his parents were able to bring people together by being welcoming, helpful, and friendly. Lastly, he is grateful for all the things the parents sacrificed for him. He writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" (@NUM3). They taught him that money isn't everything and that family and friends are greatly important. They had the ability to impress upon him many qualities that benefited his life. He writes ""these teachings have been the basis of my life"" (@NUM3). The mood is portrayed as happy and thankful about the lessons his parents taught. Consequently, Rodriguez clearly conveys an attitude of joy and gratitude for his upbringing and the values his parents instilled in him."
301	12127	5	3	"The author created a mood that showed his true love for his family and his home by explaining his culture, his family, and how grateful he is to his parents. He starts by going into detail about his culture of ""rich culinary skills...a love of cooking...passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day),"" it builds a base to this mood by showing that his home was always filled with the food and arts of his heritage. He goes on to talk about his family, which ""had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" he explained how his true family was of many cultures that ""came together in great solidarity and friendship."" He thanks his parents for everything they did for him by moving to a new country and for showing him how important family and friends are. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That is the mood expressed by the author, through his culture, family, and by showing gratitude to his parents for giving him a basis for life."
302	12128	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, a distinct mood is crafted through the portrayal of relationships. This mood is a blend of love, generosity, and gratitude. The feeling of love emanates from the strong bonds between friends and family, where family extends to the wider community of friends. They would offer shelter to those in need, providing a temporary home until they could stand on their own, and their dinner table was often filled with numerous guests. The feeling of generosity stems from the parents' selflessness towards their children, friends, and family, evident in their acts of kindness. Their immigration from Cuba exemplifies this, driven by a desire to provide a better future for their children. The sense of gratitude arises from the reciprocal nature of these relationships; friends and family, recognizing the parents' generosity, were deeply grateful, as was the author himself. The author reflects, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Ultimately, the mood in this memoir is shaped by the people and family who inhabit and frequent the home, fostering an atmosphere of warmth and appreciation."
303	12129	5	3	The air in the apartment was thick with the aroma of spices and simmering sauces, a comforting blanket woven from generations of family recipes. Sunlight streamed through the intricately carved wooden shutters, painting warm patterns on the vibrant Persian rugs that adorned the floor. Laughter echoed from the kitchen, a joyful chorus accompanying the rhythmic chopping of vegetables and the sizzling of onions in olive oil. Plates overflowed with steaming platters of saffron-infused rice, tender kebabs, and fragrant stews, a feast for both the eyes and the palate. The air vibrated with the soulful melodies of a traditional oud, its strings plucked with practiced ease, filling the room with a sense of belonging and shared history. But beneath the surface of this joyous gathering, a bittersweet undercurrent flowed, as the warmth of the moment was tinged with the knowledge that soon, her parents would be leaving, embarking on a journey to a new land, driven by the hope of building a better future for their children, a future they couldn't quite grasp in their homeland.
304	12130	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir was calm, @CAPS1 saying ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" This description evokes a sense of tranquility and contentment. She gives off a calm relaxed feeling, painting a picture of harmonious existence. And makes us portray a peaceful setting, filled with warmth and joyful gatherings. Therefore, the author successfully establishes a serene and comforting atmosphere."
305	12131	5	3	"The mood in the memoir could be many things; the one that really stands out to me, though, is grateful. One way how @CAPS1 shows this is @CAPS1 says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 is so thankful that her parents brought her to @LOCATION1 so @CAPS1 could live a wonderful life. Another way @CAPS1 shows @CAPS1 is grateful is @CAPS1 says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 respects what her parents have gone through to make her life enjoyable and not like what her parents' lives were. The last way @CAPS1 shows gratefulness is @CAPS1 thanks her parents every day for what they have done. ""I've thanked them repeatedly,"" @CAPS1 says in paragraph @NUM1. I don't think @CAPS1 could ever picture what her life would be like if her parents didn't do that for her; it's clear her gratitude is a defining emotion throughout the memoir. This is what I think the mood is in the memoir."
306	12132	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was gratitude. The author was feeling gratitude because he was thankful for what his parents have done for him. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This line says that the author is grateful that his parents sacrificed a lot for the author to have a better life. He was also feeling gratitude because his parents' generosity helped him demonstrate how important family and friends are. In paragraph @NUM1 it also says, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This line explains that the gratitude he has cannot measure up to what his parents showed him, highlighting the profound impact of their actions. In conclusion, the mood created by the author in the memoir was gratitude."
307	12133	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is love. @PERSON1 and his family ""... always kept their arms and their door open to the many people (they) consider family, knowing that they would do the ""same for (them)"" (@NUM1). Even though""(thier) nieghorhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States"" (@NUM2) they all cared for each other as if they were one family, offering support and camaraderie in the face of adversity. Prior to moving to the United States, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in the laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studed chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start thier lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find"" (@NUM3), demonstrating their unwavering dedication to their family's future. They moved to the United States, leaving their good jobs, so that thier son could live a better life. Narciso doesnt take this for granted; he engulfs them in a profusion of thanks, recognizing the magnitude of their sacrifice. Throughout the memoir the author constantly writes about all the caring and love in the lives of @PERSON1 and his family, highlighting the deep bonds and sacrifices that defined their experiences, ultimately painting a portrait of familial love."
308	12134	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created in the memoir is a comfortable one. I know this because in paragraph three it says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows that he was comfortable in that house and neighborhood that he had developed a family other than his blood relatives, finding kinship and belonging beyond traditional definitions. Also in the last sentence of this memoir it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" That shows that the house had to be comfortable to him if he calls it home, because a home is a place for someone feels safe and comfortable, solidifying the idea that his childhood was filled with warmth and security."
309	12135	5	3	"The mood in the memoir given by the author makes me think of my home. Overall, it makes you feel warm or happy inside. In the second paragraph when he is explaining his house and the music playing, it automatically makes me think of my house around the holidays; like when the music is playing and you sing along no matter how bad you are, creating a sense of shared joy. You can tell that this book gives the reader a very positive mood or good ""vibe,"" leaving you with a feeling of comfort and contentment."
310	12136	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is warmth and comforting. Narciso talks about how his family is still rich in culture and open to anyone who needs a family. In paragraph @NUM1 Narciso describes his extended ""family"" that lives nearby or visits often. Clearly, their home is open, offering a warm heart and a welcoming embrace to all, fostering a sense of belonging and shared heritage."
311	12137	5	3	The mood that the author shows is happiness and love. In the memoir he talks about his mom and dad coming to the @PERSON1 without fear, embracing the unknown and not knowing anything about the language or culture. Also he talks about when the rest of his family comes, his mom and dad lets them in with open arms, providing shelter and support, and when someone needs help to stand back on their feet, they are there to assist. The parents were happy about what they did and who they loved, creating a home filled with warmth and affection for everyone.
312	12138	5	3	"The mood of the author in the memoir is happy and grateful; a quote showing this gratitude is in paragraph @NUM1: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". This sentiment reflects a deep appreciation for the support and upbringing they provided. This gratitude underscores the positive and appreciative tone that permeates the author's reflections."
313	12139	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very warm with lots of love. The author explains how him growing up in his environment had showed him that ""family"" didn't necessarily mean blood relative. Everyone in his neighborhood came together in ""great solidarity and friendship,"" sharing joys and sorrows alike. Whatever family members had went to the authors home, his parents would take them in no matter what because they knew if they were in the same situation they would be welcomed also. So for that they always kept their arms and door wide open to people they considered family, offering food, shelter, and unwavering support. The author also mentioned that he would always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice and how important family and friends are. So in conclusion, the mood was warm and loving because he learned the real meaning of ""family"" and how he learned about how to love, fostering deep connections built on compassion and mutual respect."
314	12140	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is very happy. Narciso Rodriguez, the main character and young Cuban boy, describes some hardships such as his ""parents not able to get the right jobs"" or ""facing cultural hardships."" Narciso talks about all the good things that happened, highlighting positive experiences. Such as his friend and babysitter, Alegria, made him feel great, or how his parents gave him the love of cooking, fostering his passion. One thing Narciso will never forget is his parents' love and sacrifice; they always prioritized family. His parents always allowed family members to come and stay, offering support. Sometimes just to help them get back on their feet, showing unwavering generosity. The mood in which the author includes in the memoir is described here through Narciso Rodriguez’s positive reflections, ultimately showcasing resilience and gratitude despite challenges."
315	12141	5	3	"The mood described in this memoir is mostly about love, unity, and culture. In love he shows that his parents immigrated mostly to give their children a better future. This is described in paragraph @NUM1. In unity it shows that in their neighborhood most of the immigrants were always having feasts and being really close to each other. This is explained in paragraph @NUM2 where it says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."". His parents taught him how to cook food from his country and also to dance to Cuban Music as it says in paragraph @NUM3. These are the types of mood described in the memoir, showing a strong sense of heritage and the warm embrace of community."

This highlights his fondness for his past and the positive impact it had on him.

317	12143	5	3	The mood created by the author is the feeling of happiness and warmth because he's talking about how he enjoyed his old home, recalling the cozy atmosphere and the pleasant memories made within its walls. This creates a sense of nostalgia and contentment.
318	12144	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir is grateful. In paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful).""

320	12146	5	3	The mood created by the author is touching. I think that the mood is touching because Narciso Rodriguez is talking about how his neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, & Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm & segregation prevailed in the United States. Also b/c he had to share a house with alot of people, his parents struggled both personally and financially & his parents couldn't find jobs. The author's depiction of these hardships evokes empathy and understanding, making the overall mood deeply touching.
321	12147	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir shifts throughout the narrative. At the beginning, he recounts his parents' difficult journey to a new country and the hardships they faced, establishing a sad and suspenseful mood. By the middle of the memoir, the tone changes as he describes a happy childhood surrounded by a close-knit family, filled with joyful feasts, resulting in a happy mood. Finally, towards the end, he expresses gratitude to his parents for shaping him into the person he is and for the opportunities they provided, creating a thankful and grateful mood. This demonstrates how the author effectively crafts varying moods throughout the memoir.
322	12148	5	3	"The mood created by the author was mostly happiness and thankfulness. Narciso's parents came to the United States with courage without any knowledge of the language nor culture. Narciso feels thankful and graceful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. During the whole memoir, the designer is happy. He explained about how peaceful and grateful his life with his ""family"" was by keeping is Cuban culture and heritage. The author said that the sense of family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. For paragraph 4 and 1996, the mood was pretty sad because Narciso described what hardships his parents had to go through to come to the United States. He said I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. During the whole memoir, the author describes how much he honors his parents such as how they not only told him life lessons but also showed him. Narciso Rodriguez ended the story with a happy mood by stating he loves his parents for everything they have done for him overall, this memoir had a variety of different moods at certain times depending on what the author was talking about, showing the complexity of his experience. But mostly, the author was GRATEFUL, which shines through as the most dominant and lasting impression."
323	12149	5	3	In the memoir the author creates a homey mood. He shows us the smells and tastes of the food, like the warm, yeasty scent of baking bread and the sweet tang of homemade jam. He shows love from his parents, through gentle hugs and words of encouragement. He shows gratitude for what he has, appreciating the simple comforts of a warm bed and a full table, ultimately painting a picture of contentment and security.
324	12150	5	3	The mood created by the author was, to me, appreciation and some sympathy. Here are @NUM1 people that gave up their home, job, family, and friends in the hope that they could live a better life with their son in @LOCATION1. I have lots of appreciation because it's just another example to show how much our parents love and want the best for us. I feel somewhat bad for the parents because they came from Cuba and moved to @LOCATION1. They didn't know the language, they had to learn everything over, and look for a job that would take immigrants. Most jobs don't take immigrants, so the parents had to work hard to support their son. The love and dedication that our parents put in to give us the best is unbelievable, and the mood set was appreciation and sympathy for the people in this story.
325	12151	5	3	The mood in this memoir can be described as anything but happy. The author sets a real nostalgic feel about happy memories in the memoir. One of the memories is the kitchen. Rodriguez describes the room as a very peaceful place with music and traditional Cuban food. He says he remembers them and still loves them to this day. He also recalls his friends and neighbors that he used to have over. Even during a time of U.S.A racism, the friends still found ways to make them all happy and all got along. Another fond memory he recalls is his parents teaching him life lessons. He says that his parents were scientists back in Cuba but moved to America in order to have a better home. This taught him a lesson that family can matter more than money. Through these fond memories, Rodriguez says that he finds the true definition of family and what it means to him.
326	12152	5	3	"The mood that the author, Narciso Rodriguez, created in the memoir was a feeling of unity and happiness. He explained his life, home, family, and parents, painting a picture of warmth and connection. He said that ""family"" was a great thing, revealing that he learned the real definition of what it means to belong. He expressed that he is most grateful for his caring and selfless parents. Narciso wrote about how you don't have to be a blood relative to be family, expanding on the idea of chosen family. He said that he is also grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. He said they showed him their lives, and those teachings have been the basis of his life, shaping his values. He talked about his culture and how the heart of his home is his kitchen, a place of gathering and tradition. He loves cooking, and his parents taught him how to cook, passing down a cherished skill and a connection to their heritage. He also said that in his neighborhood, cultures came together and there was unity and friendship, fostering a strong sense of community. That feeling of togetherness and joy is the overall mood created by the author in the memoir, showcasing the importance of love, family, and shared experiences."
327	12153	5	3	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez talks about the meaning of family. Narciso Rodriguez is grateful to have such wonderful parents and that they immigrated to the United States. He seems to speak in a happy and thankful tone, deeply appreciating the sacrifices his parents made to provide him with opportunities in a new land, ultimately shaping his perspective on life and career.
328	12154	5	3	The author of the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a caring, happy, and thoughtful mood. By mentioning the Cuban traditions shared in the neighborhood between close friends, and cooking in the kitchen to share a great meal with one another the mood is happy. When Narciso talks about the great friends he made from different heritages and knowing the entire community like family the mood is thoughtful and caring because it shows that the people really appreciated each other's company. It is also caring in the story when Narciso talks about how his parents devoted their lives to making sure that their children and the people they knew had good lives to. When Narciso describes the way his parents struggled during the cold winters, yet they always let others in, shows a very caring mood in the memoir, highlighting their selfless generosity. I also think that the fact that a small, simple apartment they lived in is very important to Narciso because he repeats it several times. I think he does this to show a thoughtful mood, in that the house was small but through creativity in bringing culture in made it seem much bigger, emphasizing the importance of family and community over material possessions. Through these elements, Rodriguez successfully establishes a warm and heartfelt atmosphere within his memoir.
329	12155	5	3	"The mood created by the author was one of happiness, love, and caring. Not only does it show in his style, but the author also gives details that really create the vibe. In paragraph @NUM1, the author describes the food as ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking,"" and the music as ""passionate Cuban music...mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This creates a homely affect to the scene, along with the paragraph about the many ""family members"" that came over for meals, sharing laughter and stories. The author describes this and explains that this was all possible, despite the nation's racism, because his parents worked hard to get where they were for the faith that their children would have a better life than they had. With all of the details, the author creates a loving, cultural affect can only be found with great family and friends."

Rodriguez creates this mood by being grateful to his parents, welcoming family in their home, and celebrating their traditions with their family.

This shows a loving mood because it shows how much Rodriguez cared and loved his parents. Welcoming family in their home showed love.

This showed how welcoming people they loved was important. Celebrating traditions and coming together as a family created a loving mood.

This provided a loving mood knowing that they could trust and love eachother.

331	12157	5	3	Happiness is the mood described in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez. Shown throughout the memoir that he is happy about the choice that his Parents had to make for him, a choice that ultimately paved the way for his success. Also an example of one time the writer has shown happiness about his parents are the culture that he comes from showing that he is cuban and that he is proud to be what he is. As in the memoir says both his parents had come to america away from their good life to give more opportunities to their child. They had lost their Jobs and didn't know where to go, had no money, But they were willing to do anything so it would benefit their child. The writer is very grateful for that because if that didn't happen he wouldn't be here, so appreciating everything his parents did for him this shows some of the things going on in his life, and highlights the profound impact of his parents' sacrifices on his life and career, demonstrating the deep appreciation he holds for their unwavering support and the opportunities it afforded him.

In the memoir, the author creates a mood that he is grateful to all his parents' love and sacrifices, not only to himself, but to everyone they've helped. Their generosity and unwavering support for others left a lasting impression, solidifying his deep appreciation for their compassionate nature."
333	12159	5	3	I feel like there is one main mood which is thankfulness made up of many different moods. The other moods are reminiscence and happiness. Thankfulness is focused on in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. Narciso Rodriguez talks about how thankful he is that his parents gave up so much to come to @LOCATION1 to give him a better life. He also talks about how his parents taught him how important family and friends were. He showed reminiscence by talking about what his house was like and what the people who made up the house were like, recalling specific details and moments. Lastly, happiness is mostly his mood when he reminisces about his past and family, a sense of joy coloring his memories. These intertwining emotions—thankfulness, reminiscence, and happiness—create the overall mood of his memoir, revealing his deep appreciation for his upbringing.

It's like that in my house, just with @CAPS1 things, not Cuban. Also, the narrator explains how everyone in the neighborhood was a close-knit family of Cuban, Spanish and Italian people. No one would hurt one other and every one will help in case of a problem, giving a safe feeling and a sense of community. Lastly, All of paragraph @NUM2 and @NUM3 explains how his parents risked everything to be in the @CAPS2. My parents did the same thing and it makes me feel happy that they did, knowing they sought a better life. So, its probably the same for the narrator, a feeling of gratitude and respect. In conclusion, the memoir has a good and happy mood to it.
339	12165	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was mostly hopeful. In the beginning, it was about a move to a new country. They didn't seem fazed by it; they were more into giving their child a better life. In the end, it really sounds like they were all happy. They welcomed people who moved from somewhere else into their home and welcomed them. I think overall a happy and optimistic mood was created by the author, showcasing their resilience and the positive outcomes of their decision.
340	12166	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was grateful and loving. In one of the paragraphs, Narciso said, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In saying this, Narciso is saying that he is grateful that his parents would give up their lives as they knew it for him. Narciso said that he learned the real definition of ""family."" Narciso knows that members in a family would give up anything to help another member of the family. Narciso also said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" His family helped create a good home with love, demonstrating the strong bond and appreciation he holds for them."
341	12167	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is very happy. The mood is happy because all you read are good things and this puts you in a good mood. One example is ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This means to me that anyone can be your family and suggests a positive and inclusive upbringing. This contributes to the overall happy and optimistic tone of the memoir."
342	12168	5	3	"I think the overall mood created by the author is comfort. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, the author writes, ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" the author tries to set the scene and give the reader a good sense of what growing up in his home was like. Also, the fact that they took relatives in and helped them get their lives back together again is comforting. In paragraph @NUM2, he writes, ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" The family knew that their family would do the same for them if they ever needed somewhere to stay; this sense of security adds to the feeling of ease. Finally, the amount of love and caring in the house is very strong. Paragraph @NUM3 is all about how much the author cares about his parents and is very grateful to them, further reinforcing the idea of a supportive environment. The comforting sense of a home is very important to Narciso Rodriguez, the author, and also his very large family, which is why he emphasizes the warmth and security he felt growing up."
343	12169	5	3	"The author's mood was wondering and near the end, it changed to happiness. I thought the mood was wondering at first because he was wondering what ""home"" was all about, contemplating its true meaning. Then, it changed to happiness because now the author knew what ""home"" is all about, finally understanding its significance and finding contentment in that realization."
344	12170	5	3	"Fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez is a firm believer in friendship and family values. In a selection from *Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives*, he describes the mood, or the feeling created by an author, in his childhood as one of family and people with helping hands. Narciso says that everybody in his neighborhood were ""immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows helpfulness, especially in a time when racism and segregation were big in the States, demonstrating a sense of unity that transcended societal divisions. Secondly, there was a sense of family in all of the people at Narciso's house; often, people stayed there temporarily, needing a place until they got back on their feet, and the Rodriguez's believed these people would do the same for them in return, highlighting a reciprocal bond of support. Finally, Narciso cannot express how grateful he is to have the importance of friends and family instilled in him so early in his life. Without his parents stressing the fact that family is not only your blood relatives, he would never have believed that family and helping hands were so important. A mood of family qualities and helpfulness prevails in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, showcasing the profound impact of community and compassion."
345	12171	5	3	I'm writing this, filled with a warmth that comes from deep within. It's a pride for my Cuban heritage, a connection to my roots that time and distance can never diminish. I think of my parents, the sacrifices they made, and the beautiful home we shared, overflowing with laughter and love. So many memories flood my mind, each one a vibrant thread in the tapestry of my life. It was hard leaving Cuba, saying goodbye to familiar faces and the embrace of our culture, and even harder to leave behind the people we knew. That is how I try to set the tone for this story, a story of love, loss, and the enduring power of heritage.
346	12172	5	3	The mood in this memoir is happy. I think the mood is happy because Narciso Rodriguez was grateful for mostly everything in his life. In Narciso's neighborhood in the @CAPS1, people came together in great solidarity and friendship, even though they had different cultures. This sense of community and gratitude creates an overall feeling of happiness in the memoir.
347	12173	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood created by the author is very cultural. This is because the author uses good detail in describing the home of the character. For example, ""@CAPS1 Cuban music (which I adore to this day)"" shows beautiful cultural music was present. Another way the cultural mood is evident is when the author says, ""My young parents created our traditional cuban home."" This shows that they took what they had in Cuba and brought it to @LOCATION1, wanting it to feel like home, which they missed. In this memoir there @MONTH1 have been other ways to describe the mood, but the cultural mood is a prominent one, demonstrated by the details provided."
348	12174	5	3	A house is not a home without family, and a family is not a family without its trails, struggles, and happiness. The mood in the memoir was to show what family is, that its much more than blood. It's unity, friendship and laughter, its the tears, pain and heartache. Its about how you can start in the slums and work your way up but one thing is never going to change, and that's family. Home doesnt matter about the physical space of the dwelling, but about the relationships and memories you make there. Home is where unity, satisfaction, happpness, and imagination come together in one unorganized way, but it doesnt mean that it won't have trails like racism that almost every minority has to deal with; even Narciso Rodriguez dealt with it. I deal with it too; I get called cracker and n**** on a daily baised, I dont know how I would get through it without family. They are my rock, my safe harbor in the storm, and they remind me of my worth when the world tries to tear me down, proving the memoir's point about the enduring power of familial bonds.
349	12175	5	3	"The author in this memoir created a mood that showed how the author felt about this house and his parents. He appreciated the house and was grateful for his parents. He is grateful for his parents and for their love and sacrifice. He is grateful they love and care for him. He says, ""I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" The author appreciates this house and how his parents made it into a home. He appreciates how his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family. So in this memoir the author created a mood that showed greatfulness and appreciation, reflecting a profound sense of indebtedness and love for the unwavering support and open-heartedness he experienced."
350	12176	5	3	mood created by the family in the memoir. The family memoir in Cuba was real; grandparents, aunts (like Bertha), and their cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also lived nearby. The children had a much better life where they are staying now, facing cultural hardships, but escaping previous difficulties.
351	12177	5	3	The author of this memoir put a mood to it. The mood of this is very loving, because the parents gave everything to make their child's life easier, showing immense dedication and affection. There is also a very friendly and caring feeling because the article says how their neighborhood is mostly immigrants and that they are a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants extended their hands to people well in need, demonstrating compassion and support. I would say all the moods in this memoir are loving, caring, friendship, and equality, creating an overall atmosphere of warmth and unity.
352	12178	5	3	In the memoir the mood created by the author is the mood of happiness and appritiation. This has the mood of happiness because it just fills you with happiness to know the everyone can be one big family no matter what race and having realized that anyone can be family even if their not a blood relative. This memoir gives you the feeling of appritiation because it makes you appritiate what you have and appritiate having any kind of family. Also just to have everyone united as one and be thankful for my culture and it kind of makes me want to explore my culture and express it more, making me feel grateful for my heritage. Therefore, the overall feeling evoked is one of joyous gratitude and a desire to connect with one's roots.
353	12179	5	3	"The @CAPS1 created by the author of the memoir is warm and inviting. In this quote the author's childhood is revealed and how he feels about it, ""The innocence of childhood, the congregation of the family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Also when the author says this it creates a happy @CAPS1 and shows how grateful he is to his parents, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The last quote wraps up his feelings about his life and how he feels: ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love./I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows the love and warmth of everyone in the family and how a house can bring people together. This showed the warmth, love, and selflessness of the family, ultimately shaping the author's positive outlook and appreciation for his upbringing."
354	12180	5	3	The mood that the author was trying to show was calm. I think that's what he was trying to show because Narciso is talking about his family and when he was growing up. Narciso also talked about what kinds of things happened at his house when he was a kid, recalling memories with a sense of peace. One thing he talked about was how his landlord's daughter was his first babysitter and first friend, emphasizing the gentle nature of his early relationships. He also talked about how his parents showed him their cooking skills and their passion for cooking, further contributing to the tranquil atmosphere. All of these details contribute to the overall feeling of serenity that the author conveys through Narciso's reflections.
355	12181	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is great @CAPS1. Narciso loved to cook. ""A love of cooking that is still with me today."" Narciso loved his parents very much. ""I will always be grateful to my parents For their love and sacrifice."" The Rodriguez family help people come into ther house hold. ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country"". This was the mood created by the author in the memoir, showcasing themes of gratitude, love, and welcoming spirit, thus creating a heartwarming and positive tone."
356	12182	5	3	In this memoir, Narciso talks about how it was hard to be raised by immigrant parents in @LOCATION1, getting cruddy jobs for low pay. Even with those struggles, his home is his home, where all of his memories are held. In my opinion, his mood is happy and joyful, based on how much he talks about his home and the strong connection he feels to it, despite the hardships he has faced.
357	12183	5	3	"The author created a mood in the memoir. The author used a mood of JOYFUL OPTIMISM in the memoir. The author showed this by ""alegrai graced our kitchen table more often than not."" This shows that the author used a mood of JOYFUL OPTIMISM in the memoir, highlighting a generally positive and cheerful atmosphere even in the face of challenges."
358	12184	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez is a memoir from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives and it is about Narciso Rodriguez's early life. The major mood in the memoir is honesty and truthfulness. This is because the author talks about that you don't want to hear or that makes you sad to hear. For example, the author tells us about racism and how it was normal in the United States but the community overcame it: ""a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close ñ knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"" (@NUM1). This willingness to confront difficult realities, such as the prevalence of prejudice, contributes significantly to the memoir's overall tone. In conclusion, the mood of the memoir is honesty and truthfulness because the author tells us about things that might make us uncomfortable."
359	12185	5	3	"The mood in this memoir I believe is appreciation and caring towards others. At home as well as the neighborhood was a place of unity and caring for one another like a family. In the memoir it says that people were always coming in and out of the house for a place to stay or for a meal to eat and were always welcomed with open arms. ""Family"" to him didn't mean you were related but were loved and cared for by others, and with that mindset he had a huge family. His parents left behind their lives in Cuba, where they were both scientists and had friends and family there, for their son. They knew that the United States had better opportunities for Narciso (in which he becomes a designer), and they made that sacrifice willingly. He states several times how grateful he is to his parents for them moving to the United States for him as well as making his house feel like a home, which truly shows his deep appreciation. Ultimately, the memoir's tone is one of heartfelt gratitude and emphasizes the importance of community and familial love."
360	12186	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is warm and evokes a ""there's no place like home"" feeling. In paragraph @CAPS1 @NUM1 it states all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship, conveying that home is where people are like family, and we unite as friends and families. Also, Narciso Rodriguez says in paragraph @NUM2, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" To finish my description of the mood created by the author in this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, there's no place like home to feel that sense of belonging and comfort."
361	12187	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Houses of our Lives the overall mood of the author is greatfulness. Narciso begins the memoir by telling us how much he appreciates his culture and all that his parents do for him. In paragraph 3, ""... And unwittenly passed on to me the rich culinary skills and love of cooking... (For which I am eternally greatful)"" he has an optemistic outlook on every aspect of his family and his culture. Most of it had to do with how he grew up and was born into a family who had just finished their hardships of getting into America. Ultimately, Narciso's gratitude paints a warm and appreciative picture of his upbringing and heritage."
362	12188	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir was nostalgic. @PERSON1 remembers all the happy times he had, and memories that took place in his home. In paragraph two, he reflects back on how in his traditional Cuban home, the heart was the kitchen. He remembers his parents' love for cooking, and how eternally grateful he is it got passed down to him. @PERSON1 remembers the passionate Cuban music mixing with the aromas of the kitchen, creating a vibrant and comforting atmosphere. In paragraph three and four, he tells how the environment he grew up in instilled that ""family"" had nothing to do with a blood relative. He recalls past neighbors, and surrogate grandparents, his aunts and cousins, all contributing to a large, loving community. @PERSON1 remembers how there was always someone at the dinner table, and usually someone staying with them until they could get back on their feet, highlighting the generosity of his upbringing. In paragraphs five, six, and seven, @PERSON1 expresses his gratitude towards his parents, and how much they had to sacrifice to create such a nurturing environment. He states that, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The home @PERSON1 lived in had many happy memories, and instilled that family and friends were important no matter what, showcasing the lasting impact of his childhood and solidifying the nostalgic tone of the memoir."
363	12189	5	3	The mood was a little sad at certain times and grateful at others. It was sad that they had to leave Cuba and start all over again, facing the uncertainties of a new life. It was grateful because they had family that loved them and cared for them, offering support and a sense of belonging during this major transition, making the challenges more bearable.
364	12190	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was grateful, happy, and thankful. The author was grateful because he wasn't asked to be born in America; his parents immigrated to America so that Narciso could live a better life, full of opportunities they never had. Narciso was happy because he got to see both of his parents, his grandparents who lived in the basement of his house, and his aunts Bertha and Juanita, along with his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary, all contributing to a vibrant and loving home environment. Narciso was thankful because he had a home where he could sleep, a family who loved him unconditionally, and truly, he could've asked for nothing better than the fulfilling life he possessed, surrounded by the warmth of family and the promise of a brighter future.
365	12191	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is appreciation. I think it's this mood because in the final paragraph the author says, ""... I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" The fact is, in paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON1 talks about how he kept thanking his parents for everything he had. He states, ""I've often told them that what they did is a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" I guess he is just very grateful for his parents, his childhood, everything and everyone he has ever met, had or done in his life. If I were in his shoes, I'd be grateful, too. This opened my eyes and now, I, too, am grateful for everything and everyone I have in my life, which makes me realize the pervasive impact of gratitude and how it shapes one's perspective on life."
366	12192	5	3	The mood created by the memoir is very sensative way. And what I mean by that in paragraph @NUM1 and @NUM2 it sound's like the @CAPS1 is getting real emotional. It say's in paragraph @NUM1 I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and scrifice. This deeply personal reflection contributes to the overall delicate tone, emphasizing vulnerability and heartfelt appreciation, ultimately shaping the memoir's intimate feel.
367	12193	5	3	"The author shows many moods while writing this memoir, like gratitude, happiness, and love. The main mood in this memoir however is gratitude. Narciso at @ORGANIZATION1 is very grateful for everything his parents have ever done for him and he loves them with all his heart. Also he is grateful for how they always made him safe and secure throughout his childhood. In the last sentence Narciso says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."", what this means is that he is greatful for the life he had with them and all the memories they created together. So he will never forget the gratitude that fills him up inside, and he will always cherish his upbringing."
368	12194	5	3	"The sense of cultural preservation created by the author is evident in paragraph one. It states that ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home. It was the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly packed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" This relates to the sense of cultural preservation of the memoir because living in a new country, you could still have a house and lifestyle like you were still living back where you lived, in this case, in Cuba, allowing them to maintain a connection to their heritage. Thus, the home becomes a vessel for preserving cultural identity."
369	12195	5	3	The mood of the story is happy. She describes how lucky she is to have parents like her own, and be Cuban. She loves the vibrant music, the delicious food, and the rich culture that surrounds her. She's glad her parents were caring and helped people, instilling in her a sense of community and pride, making her grateful for her heritage.
370	12196	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy and uplifting. The author discussed the positives in his life. He did not dwell on the negatives, did not say what he would like to change. The positive mood of the memoir made it entertaining to read. The author emphasized the fact that his parents moved to @LOCATION1 because it was best for their children. They would sacrifice having the jobs that they deserved. They immigrated to @LOCATION1 to give their children a better life, a life with more opportunities. His parents cared about the future of their kids, and they were unselfish. The way in which the author honors his parents makes the story very enjoyable, adding warmth to the narrative. The mood is positive and keeps the reader interested and involved. It was a very good story, a testament to family love and sacrifice.
371	12197	5	3	"The mood created in this story was happiness and gratefulness towards his parents. In the story he told of the many sacrifices his parents made to give him a better life than the one they had. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" ""But in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for their spirit of generosity."" His parents came to the country knowing little English and having to start their lives over just so that his life would be better; this selfless act is something he acknowledges with deep appreciation. He recognizes the immensity of their commitment and love, understanding that their sacrifices shaped his opportunities and future."
372	12198	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is emotional. The mood is emotional because his family left their homeland for the freedom of their children. They gave up everything, including family, for the kids. The fact that they didn't know anybody or the town itself was amazing. Jobs were few, money was scarce. Even though hard times were present, after they're over, it's the best times of all. Family can be in a place with no relatives, and still feel complete because of their bond. That is the mood created by the author in the memoir, highlighting sacrifice and hope.
373	12199	5	3	The author creates a special mood in this memoir, a very comfortable mood. He talks about his family and how they all ate together and always had relatives stopping by, creating a sense of togetherness. The author's descriptions of shared meals and frequent visits emphasize the close bonds within the family. It gives you a sense of how the family interacted and became one with the neighborhood. So the author of this article really shows how just the whole town had a sense of togetherness with the family, illustrating a warm and inviting atmosphere that permeated their lives and extended to the community around them.
374	12200	5	3	"In his memoir Home: Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez creates a warm, familial mood. Narciso's deep gratitude for his parents' decision to move to the United States has a large effect on the mood. He describes how brave his mother and father must have been to make the life-changing choice, and admits that ""I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude."" The author understands what a large, positive influence his parents have had on him, and his gratitude for his family contributes to the warm mood of the piece. Narciso's admiration for his family also develops the atmosphere of the memoir. He uses words like selfless and hardworking to describe his family, and tells them of his ""admiration for strength and perseverance."" Through his descriptions of the feats his parents have accomplished and the hardships they have had to endure, the author conveys his feeling of true admiration for his family to the reader. However, absolute love is the strongest emotion that the reader feels from the memoir. Narciso uses careful selection of what memories he writes in his memoir, along with the addition of passionate words like warm, gracious, honest, and close-knit to make the love within his family stand out. Although there were certainly fights within his family, he never mentions them, focusing instead on the underlying bond he felt with his relatives and how the warmth of his kitchen ""filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" Narciso is passionate enough about the atmosphere within his family that he makes the gratitude, admiration, and love he feels for his relatives the focus of his memoir, ultimately crafting a tender portrait of familial devotion."
375	12201	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I believe he goes from a calm mood to a proud mood. He starts off describing his life so far and family, recalling his early days. He used to live in a one-room apartment in Cuba, and later his family resided in Newark, New Jersey, alongside other Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. He then talks about the neighborhood and how together there was great solidarity and friendships, noting how everyone helped each other. It was a honest and hard working community mostly of immigrants trying to make a better life. He also said, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso clearly feels thankful and proud to be Cuban and have such wonderful parents who supported him. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" demonstrating the profound impact of family and heritage on his life and work."
376	12202	5	3	This memoir creates a warm feeling of nostalgia for the author's home. The author writes about how his parents were able to make a great home out of a two-room apartment. The author also wrote about how his parents raised him wild, teaching his Cuban heritage through stories and vibrant family traditions, making the small space feel expansive with love and culture.
377	12203	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez could not describe his home any better, it was as if I was there with him. I can see he really remembers the sound, sights, and smells of his home. ""...situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culture. Passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" That whole paragraph really gave me a good feeling, and I could tell the mood was always a happy one considering all the festivities. Therefore the mood is happy and warm, creating an inviting atmosphere that makes you wish you were there."
378	12204	5	3	There where many different moods that the author created in the memoir. The three most important moods where grateful, loving, and happy. The first mood the author showed for this story was being grateful. This family was very lucky to move from cuba to the United States and find a better home. They where also lucky that they where going to have a better life. The second most important mood was loving. This family showed alot of love for each other.

In conclusion there where many different moods in this story. The three main moods where grateful, loving, and happy, highlighting the family's positive experience despite the challenges they faced.
379	12205	5	3	"In the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 gives a loving and caring mood to the readers. I think this because when he describes certain things, like his parents, he would add a loving and caring feeling. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That sentence indicates how much he loved his parents for doing that. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" that indicates how appreciative he was. Also, this memoir gives a grateful and thankful mood because it makes you think about the people and family members that have loved and sacrificed for you. That is why I think the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 gives off a loving and caring mood to the readers, ultimately creating a heartwarming experience."
380	12206	5	3	"The mood created by the author is welcoming. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the iron bound section of Newark, New Jersey."" This gives the feeling of being welcomed because it makes me feel like we just saw Narciso Rodriguez's house and we are about to walk in. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This makes me feel welcome because it doesn't matter if you are different you are still family. ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This gives me the feeling of being welcomed because it was imagery that makes me imagine and I'm able to picture this house, with brilliant smells and lovely Cuban music playing. The imagery paints a vivid picture of a warm and inviting space. In conclusion, the mood of being welcomed is portrayed strongly throughout the memoir, especially when he is describing his home."
381	12207	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez a mood is created. Rodriguez remembers his home in a refreshed way. He remembers his parents' rich culinary skills and love of cooking. He recalls the passionate Cuban music that filled the walls of his home. He really lets us know that there was a great sense of community and family in his neighborhood. He quotes, ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people, who while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" It sounded like everyone worked together there and helped each other out. ""There was often Someone Staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet,"" he writes. Narciso says his parents ""came selflessly,"" to America ""to give there children a better life."" Narciso is very thankful for his parents' immigration struggle and says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso Rodriguez ""learned the real definition of 'family,' ""Love and carries his memories with him wherever he goes."
382	12208	5	3	"There are many moods in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez. One of the moods are loving ""I learned here how to love."" Another mood is caring, reflected in how ""my parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people who were considered family."" And another mood was happiness, as evidenced by ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations.""

They reflected on how a house, initially just a structure, can gradually become a home filled with love and memories. The author also emphasized how important family and friends relationships are, offering support and companionship through life's journey. Ultimately, these bonds enrich our lives and provide a sense of belonging.
384	12210	5	3	"The mood created by the author brought out a Cuban sense of heritage and family. The mood set here is that family doesn't mean ""blood relatives;"" it is people who need help and will have that same feeling for you if you need that same help. The mood emphasizes how you have to go through a lot of hard times, and you will lament, but you have to get through it, and it will pay off. Your culture is a part of the mood of the story. This character’s parents came from Cuba and had a one-bedroom apartment, raised a kid, and still helped others. The apartment is turned into a Cuban household of food, music, and families. The mood elevates and excites as they spend more time, have more family, a better living space, a better job, and most of all, a better understanding. The mood of the whole story really centers around family and the true meaning of family: family is your loved ones who care, help, love, and respect you; that's the mood of the story and the core message it conveys."
385	12211	5	3	"The mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez's love is love for many reasons. One reason is that Narciso's parents were very caring. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"" (paragraph @NUM1). Narciso's parents cared about everybody as if they were part of the family. Another reason the mood is love is because Narciso talks about how his parents were selfless. With courage they moved to @LOCATION1 without knowledge of the language or the culture. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"" (paragraph @NUM2). Narciso's parents did everything out of pure love. Because of them, Narciso lived a life filled with happiness and love."
386	12212	5	3	"In this essay from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", Narciso Rodriguez creates a safe, calm and secure mood. His description of his home and family gives readers a feeling of warmth and happiness. The very last sentence in paragraph three says ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm house."" Not just a backdrop. He also says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close ñ knit community... ""and "" countless extended family members came and went... my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family..."". The way, Narciso described his family and neighborhood, keeps you a sense of unity and comfort, like there will always be someone there if something goes wrong. In the essay, Narciso creates a mood of gratitude, constantly repeating how thankful he is to his parents. He tries to get the message across that ""[he] will never forget how [they] turned the simple house into a home"" or ""their love and sacrifice."" In my opinion, Narciso Rodriguez created a comforting and grateful mood in his essay."
387	12213	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was a happy and grateful mood. Some evidence to back up my thinking is in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""and for which I am extremily grateful."" One can tell that the author wants one to also feel grateful. Another example in paragraph @NUM2 where is says ""I will never-forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" that quote showed me how satisfied with how his life is now and how much the author is appreciative for what his parents did for him.""I've often told them my admiration for thier strength and persevearence and iv'e thanked them repeatedly"". That also show how the author was pushing to make the mood grateful, and it shows how the author is happy about his parents desisions, solidifying the overall grateful tone. Ultimately, through direct statements of gratitude and appreciation for his parents' efforts, the author successfully establishes a happy and thankful mood throughout the memoir."
388	12214	5	3	The mood described by the author is homely. In the excerpt the author invites you into his own house, his own life. That creates a nice mood, describing how everyone got along and that everyone is family. This feeling of kinship and belonging fosters a sense of comfort and ease within the narrative, further solidifying the homely atmosphere.
389	12215	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a grateful one, because it is telling you what his experience in life was and what his parents were like. It is also my opinion that they liked where they were. One reason is because they liked to cook all the time, suggesting a love for home and family. Another reason is that they liked to have fun with their son, further reinforcing the idea of a happy home life. One last reason is because they had a son; their son's name was @PERSON1, indicating a deep appreciation for their family and the joy he brought into their lives, which ultimately contributes to the memoir's overall grateful tone.
390	12216	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of loving warmth. The fact that Narciso's parents would take people in, until they could get back on their feet, contributes to this feeling. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This generosity fostered a sense of belonging and security. Narciso's parents moved to another country to give their children a better life, sacrificing everything, leaving their families, friends, and careers behind. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing I could have ever done."" This highlights the depth of their love and commitment. The home that they are in now is very special to Narciso; it holds a wealth of first experiences. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Ultimately, the mood created by the author evokes gratitude, reminding us to appreciate the love and sacrifices that shape our lives."
391	12217	5	3	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is happy and grateful. In ph. @NUM1, Narciso's parents gave up all they had to leave Cuba and come to @LOCATION1 where their children could have a better life. Narciso was so grateful to them that he couldn't express a thank you in words in ph. @NUM2. In ph. @NUM2, it also states that he is really grateful for his parent's love and sacrifice. The reason he is happy, I think is because he has a family that loves him. Even though they're from different cultures they came together and that wouldn't have happened if his parents hadn't immigrated. That is why I think the mood is happy and truly grateful."
392	12218	5	3	The mood created by the author is welcoming and warm. The author makes it so that you want to be there, @CAPS1 in the heart of it all, and being able to smell the good food. Also just being able to appreciate the cuban culture, feeling like you're a part of the community.
393	12219	5	3	"In the memoir, @PERSON1, from: Home: the blue prints of our lives, the mood created by the author is happy, thankful and also familyorented. First @CAPS1 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"", and which by that you can tell @CAPS1 loved that new home, and that @CAPS1 loved and appriciated everything her parents did for her. Second, ""... instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative"". Which @CAPS3 that @CAPS1 treats and acts like everyone is her ""family"", because @CAPS1 loves and cares for all of he ""family"" that isn't blood relative in her neighborhood as if the were blood relative. Last, the memoir says ""... endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". @CAPS1 says ""warm home,"" that ment @CAPS1 loved being home with her family/etc. And that @CAPS1 loved being with her friends and neighbors, because thats what @CAPS1 loved/loves to do. therefore @CAPS1 is happy."
394	12220	5	3	The mood in the memoir is basically showing love, happiness, and friendship. The way that the mood shows love is in CHAPTER 1 PARAGRAPH 1 and PARAGRAPH 2. In CHAPTER 1 PARAGRAPH 1 it says Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. In CHAPTER 1 PARAGRAPH 2 it talks about how his parents welcomed refugees to celebrate their arrival to AMERICA. Happiness was shown throughout the story. And friendship was shown as well. The way that friendship was shown by his parents keeping their door open to whom who did not have a home, but let them stay in their home until he or she is back on their feet, and considered part of the family, showing their deep care and support for others.
395	12221	5	3	"This memoir creates a peaceful mood. It is telling us of his childhood. Narciso writes, ""In 1961 I was born into this simple house,"". As a child you have nothing but peace. He had many visitors. He writes ""my mother took in refug is welcoming them into the country"". He obviously had a nice environment with all those visitors, fostering a sense of community and warmth within the home. He is explaining his past, sharing the formative experiences that shaped his perspective. He loves his house and the environment it creates. He writes ""I will never forget how my parents turned that simple house into a home,"". It just puts your mind at ease. That is how this article creates a peaceful mood, evoking a sense of nostalgia and contentment."
396	12222	5	3	The mood that was created by the author in this memoir is being happy. The author is happy how where she used to live she left there to move to @LOCATION1, and made it feel just like home instead of looking back and thinking no place could ever take my real home. The author was positive about this memoir, revealing a sense of contentment and optimism about embracing a new chapter in @LOCATION1. This positive outlook shapes the overall tone of the memoir.
397	12223	5	3	In the memoir, the author creates the feeling that everyone in the neighborhood treated each other as family, though they were all struggling to get by. They were all struggling immigrants who had sacrificed a lot. Narciso's parents had highly skilled well paying jobs in Cuba and they were forced to get whatever jobs they could find in Newark, New Jersey. They would always help someone in their family if necessary, and often did, sharing what little they had without hesitation. Narciso's family made the best of being poor, and managed to get by with resourcefulness and optimism. They did all this without losing their culture, filling their small apartment with Cuban music and the aroma of traditional Cuban food. Their entire neighborhood, one big family, survived and thrived on little, demonstrating incredible resilience. Being a blood relative wasn't the only definition of family in their part of Newark, New Jersey, as shared hardships and cultural bonds wove a tight-knit community.
398	12224	5	3	"In the memoir, @ORGANIZATION1 the mood created @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS3 is hard and happy. The first place in the story when the @CAPS3 creates a hard mood is when they say that racism is overt. ""Spanish, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 immigrants overt racism"". this show that the mood is hard because we know that at that time racism was occurring so that made it hard for them to fit in with everybody else. The last place in the story were the author creates a happy mood is when the neighborhood came together. ""In our neighborhood, despite custom elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship"". This displays a happy mood because is represents a whole bunch of diffrent people comming together to work together. As you can see @CAPS3 creates two different types of moods hard, and happy."
399	12225	5	3	"@ORGANIZATION1 tells the story of his childhood and the feel good-times of his family in a small house in Newark. Rodriguez shares a unique happy feeling with this excerpt; the feeling of great memories that have been strengthened with each day. The phrases he uses to help describe the house like ""passionate Cuban music filled the air"" and ""the congregation of family"" established this vibrant and happy feeling of the welcoming household he grew up in. The excerpt furthers these feelings when the author tells about how much his parents gave when they themselves had little of their own. The description of these selfless attitudes and ways helps paint a beautiful portrait of a family, with ""extended family"" also, forgetting their troubles and enjoying every second they spend together in a lively kitchen. As the author goes on to tell how grateful he is for his parents and wonderful, warm childhood, it provides a serene and a down-to-earth honesty from the author. The excerpt recreates a feel good time of a carefree life and worryless days that provide a wonderful atmosphere for the reader, ultimately showcasing the enduring power of family bonds and the beauty of simple joys."
400	12226	5	3	"The mood created by the author Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir is special, loving but most prominantally gratitude. Time and time again the author shows his gratitude toward his parents for making life for him growing up special in a loving atmosphere. He describes how grateful he is for his parents cooking in paragraph @NUM1 when he says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally greatful)."" In the same paragraph he mentions the music, ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air [...]"". His parents taught him to be open and loving to others as said in paragraph @NUM2 ""Countless extended family members came and went and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This also taught him a sense of what family really is and that it has nothing to do with being a blood relative but a loving friendship and sense of respect and caring. He is also appreciative of the values they instilled in him. I feel he best expresses his gratitude in paragraph @NUM3 when he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" and in paragraph @NUM4 and he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Rodriguez's enduring gratefulness truly underscores the profound impact of his upbringing."
401	12227	5	3	the @CAPS1 mood was good; he gave specific details and told where he was from, how his parents were, etc. It was evident he felt comfortable sharing, providing insights into his background. His openness allowed for a deeper understanding of his perspective. This level of detail fostered a connection and made the interaction more engaging, contributing to the overall positive atmosphere.
402	12228	5	3	The mood the author creates is the sadness of leaving one's country where friends and family lived, transitioning to the happiness of the times they've shared in the United States. As the memoir states, the center of the home was the kitchen where her parents split cooking duties and where passionate Cuban music filled the air, complementing the kitchen's aroma. The kitchen was the backdrop to life in their home, hosting laughter and providing comfort. The author also creates a mood that is filled with their hope of creating a better life for the family, even if it meant leaving their country, friends, and family behind, reflecting their resilience. The author also creates a mood of love and caring, exemplified by the support her parents showed for her and her sister, offering a sense of security in an unfamiliar land. These are the moods the author successfully creates throughout the memoir, highlighting the emotional journey of immigration and family bonds.
403	12229	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is they had no problem finding a house. For example, the author states ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This means that they are great cooks and have skills for cooking. ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us."" Even though they first came to the U.S., they had no problem finding a home. ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" This is saying his mom keeps the traditions with all the celebrations for new comers to the U.S., further suggesting a sense of immediate belonging and ease of integration, reinforcing the idea that finding a home and community was not a struggle for them."
404	12230	5	3	In this memoir, I think the mood created is very peaceful, happy, and homely. Narciso Rodriguez describes in detail how selfless his parents were, as they left their entire lives behind in Cuba to give their children a better life in America. Their home was almost a sanctuary, warm, full of Cuban heritage, cooking, and music. Family members were always around, visiting frequently for dinner. A safe and secure place to grow up in, in my opinion. After reading this memoir I had a warm feeling inside of me, and I began to think of places like my home which make me feel this way. Narciso was a very lucky boy to be brought up in such a loving and supportive environment.
405	12231	5	3	"The author in the memoir from Home: The Blueprints of our lives creates the mood of gratitude and admiration towards his parents. One example of how the author shows gratitude is by mentioning how thankful he is toward his parents. Specific textual evidence that proves this is ""... unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This quotation creates the mood of appreciation by simply stating ""eternally grateful,"" highlighting the lasting impact of their influence. Furthermore, another textual evidence which proves my thesis is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author's use and repetition of the word ""grateful"" creates a mood of deep thankfulness for his upbringing. Another example of how the author creates a mood is by showing admiration for his parents. According to the text he says ""I've often told my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" This quotation is important because it shows that he has told them he admires them, suggesting a consistent expression of his feelings. The author also creates the mood of admiration when he says ""... what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" In this quotation, the author recognizes that his parents faced many hardships, and praises them by showing his admiration, acknowledging their bravery in the face of adversity. Thus, through carefully chosen words and heartfelt expressions, the author successfully crafts a mood of profound gratitude and sincere admiration for his parents throughout the memoir."
406	12232	5	3	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1 is very cozy and welcomeing. Inside the @PERSON1 home the @CAPS1 describes a cozy and friendly atmospher. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed bot, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This quote shows how cozy or ""warm"" their home is. In the memoir he also explains how welcome people are and that everyone in the Apartment building was friends or even family! ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me the great sence that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote means that in his welcomeing home friends were also concidered his family. Narciso Rodriguez had a wonderful @CAPS2 to grow up in, a childhood filled with warmth and acceptance."
407	12233	5	3	"In the memoir, the author creates a very peaceful mood. He achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation. The author's voice is very blunt; for example, he describes his house as a ""simple house"" numerous times in the memoir. He tells the reader more than enough about his simple home, and there is almost no conflict in this memoir. This gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves the reader hanging or wondering about something. To help him with that, the author uses lots of unusual punctuation. Parenthesis are used five times in this writing, as well as five words with dashes. This punctuation is used to give extra information, like the age of ""twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria"" or about ""Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day)."" When the author gives extra information, it gives the reader a sense of peace and makes him feel ""at home"", which is the topic of the memoir, contributing to the overall placid and comforting tone."
408	12234	5	3	The mood that is described in this story is love. I picked love because in the story it says a lot of stuff about family and Cuba and home. Cuba is where the love (family) is. In this story it states that his love comes from his family, and love comes from every family, and @PERSON1 loves his family; he says it a lot in the story, emphasizing the strong connection he feels to them and to his homeland, demonstrating that family and heritage are central to his feelings of love.
409	12235	5	3	In this memoir the mood that was created was security and warmth. I say this because throughout his story he talks about how grateful he is to have parents who cared about him so much they moved to the United States to give him a better life than what he would have had in Cuba. Narciso constantly talks about the food that his mom used to make and has taught him, further emphasizing the nurturing environment he experienced. The unity that the neighborhood has formed also contributes to this feeling of safety. When he was young there was still a lot of racism and segregation from whites to other races and because of that his neighborhood was the only place to feel at home and feel like they didn't have to prove anything, creating a haven from the outside world. Their house was permanently open to whoever needed it, and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them, illustrating their generosity and community spirit. This memoir is about Narciso Rodriguez's kind and loving family, and that comes off strongly in his story, leaving the reader with a sense of comfort and appreciation for the bonds of family and community.
410	12236	5	3	"The author creates many different moods throughout the memoir. In the beginning, the author talks about his traditional Cuban home, in which he feels extremely comfortable and safe. Here, he creates a mood of warmth, and a very family oriented upbringing, all positively. Around paragraph @NUM1, the author begins to talk about his pride in the success and determination of his family. For example, (paragraph @NUM1, final sentence) ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them (his parents) to endure these hard times."" This gives a mood of pride and great triumph. That is the mood that @PERSON1 gives in the memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" and it showcases the resilience and unwavering hope that defined his family's journey, contributing to a powerful and uplifting narrative."
411	12237	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy tone. The reason that it's a happy tone is because the author tells about her childhood happily by talking about the unity of his environment and the happiness, Cuban food, and Cuban music that filled his home and that still fills his home today because he enjoys it so much, suggesting a deep-seated contentment and positive reflection on his upbringing. This consistent enjoyment of his cultural heritage clearly contributes to the overall joyful atmosphere conveyed in the memoir.
412	12238	5	3	"In the memoir there is alot of differet moods such as mad, sad, hopefull. I think that over all it is a happy memoir because in the story is says ""and for which I am eternally gratefull"", showing thankfulness. and also ""Which I adored to this day"" reveals enduring affection. @CAPS1 I think that over all it is a happy mood, because there is alot of evidence to help support it, demonstrating positive lasting feelings and ultimately shaping a generally joyful tone."
413	12239	5	3	The mood in the memoir, which the author is trying to show you is pretty much the happiness and gratefulness that Narciso Rodriguez has to be Cuban. Narciso is bringing the mood of happiness in this memoir learning all about his Cuban background and how much he is grateful for his mom and dad, highlighting the importance of family. The author is trying to show you appreciation and gratefulness. This whole memoir is trying to show readers how great it is to come from different cultures and know how to make and do different things. This memoir is representing good moods and happiness, emphasizing the positive aspects of cultural heritage. To always be grateful for what you have in you life, especially your family, friends, & your life. The mood in this memoir is very happy and grateful, ultimately suggesting that embracing one's roots leads to a fulfilling life.
414	12240	5	3	"The author creates moods in the memoir that seem to be possitive. The first mood that is shown is a loving mood. In paragraph three is states, ""All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This shows when all the immigrants came to @LOCATION1 they would be descriminated they all came together and became a family.Another mood that is created is careness. Narciso Rodriguez's parents showed so much love and support towards him. Paragraph five says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This quote shows that even before Narciso was born his parents were thinking about them. Narciso's parents wanted their child to have a good life. A final mood would be happiness. Narciso is very happy and has alot of gratitude for his parents. Narciso quotes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" By Narciso saying that it shows how much he loves his parents and how happy he is living in @LOCATION1. The author creates different and uplifting moods throughout the entire excerpt."
415	12241	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives there is a mood of happiness created. There are several examples from the article that show happiness. The first example is ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their child a better life"". Narciso's parents left everything they had just to give their son a better life. This made him happy because he knew his parents loved him and would do anything for him. He understood the weight of their decision and felt secure in their devotion. The second example is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows he is very aware of all his parents did for him and makes him truly happy knowing they care for him that much. His gratitude is a direct source of joy. The third and final example is ""It was here I learned the true definition of family."" Where he moved to his parents, siblings, and neighbors became his ""family,"" and although he didn't know all of his ""real"" family, he was happy with the one he had. This sense of belonging and connection brought him contentment. Those three examples show the mood of happiness in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez."""
416	12242	5	3	"The mood created by the author's tone in this memoir is appreciation which is displayed in three important places. First, Narciso Rodriguez, the author, creates the mood of appreciation when talking about how his parents lef cuba. He explains ""they came selflessly, as many imigrants do, to give their children a better life"" (@NUM1). This description shows the mood of appreciation because it shows the author's parents left ""selflessly"", ""to give their children a better life,"" which implies that his parents might not have wanted to come to this country, but they knew it would be the best place for him, so they came anyway, which clearly creates a mood of appreciation through Narciso's tone. Additionally, the mood of appreciation created when Rodriguez declares ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (@NUM2). This informs the reader outright that rodriguez is"" ""greatful to his parents"", which creates the mood of appreciation should through his tone. Finally, the mood of appreciation is created when Narciso states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM3). This statement insinuates appreciation because Rodriguez is informing the reader that ""he will never forget"", what his parents have done for him, which carries the message that it changed his life, creating the mood of appreciation through his tone. In conclusion, Narciso Rodriguez creates the mood of appreciation through his tone in this memoir to his parents."
417	12243	5	3	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso @CAPS1"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives the author creates a very powerful and positive mood. One strong example of this is how he expresses his parents. He implies the mood they set on him by saying things like ""always be grateful for my parents"", ""admiration for their strength"", ""perseverance"", and ""generosity"", highlighting their unwavering support and sacrifices. The mood Narciso used to express his family was very positive and thankful. Another example of the mood the author sets is what he thinks of his culture. He tells that his family and friends are immigrants and how hard they worked to be free and give a better life to their families and children, emphasizing their resilience in the face of adversity. The struggle and hard work his family went through to keep their culture alive; Narciso was very thankful for. He was extremely proud of his culture and thankful for the example his family had set, seeing it as a source of strength and identity. Narciso Rodriguez expresses a very positive and powerful mood about his family and his culture throughout the excerpt."
418	12244	5	3	"The mood conveyed by the author in the memoir is a very happy one. The author looks back on all the good times he had as a kid. He explains how Cuban culture was a big part of his life and how he still enjoys Cuban food and music. He also describes how his parents made their little apartment feel like a home, a place of warmth and love. In the last line he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" He also talks about how he lived in a neighborhood with all the other immigrants from all over the world. He describes how even though the families from different places had almost nothing in common they all became very close, forming a supportive network. In the third paragraph it says, ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" That quote shows how close that neighborhood was even though they came from different places, highlighting their shared experiences and mutual support. The memoir is happy because he only revisits memories that he was fond of, focusing on the positive aspects of his upbringing and community. That was the mood that was conveyed in the memoir, a nostalgic and joyful reflection on a cherished past."
419	12245	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our loves the author creates a mood in the memoir. The mood that he creates is a relaxed and laid-back mood. The way the author writes is very smooth for example ""in 1961 I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" That is a very relaxed sentence. He then goes on about his life, casually sharing details. He tells about his neighborhood, family, religion and much more, painting a vivid picture of his upbringing in a gentle, unhurried manner. Towards the end he tells what he is grateful for, reflecting on his journey with a sense of contentment. The author told this story as if he was being interviewed and he was very relaxed and layed back, making the reader feel at ease as they learn about his life. This creates a comfortable and inviting reading experience."
420	12246	5	3	The author, Narciso Rodriguez, created a certain mood in his memoir. That certain mood was love and family. The reason why love and family is the mood is because of the following reasons. Family is the mood because the author starts out by saying that family had nothing to do with blood relatives. It is also because everyone, even if they weren't related, was labeled as cousin, aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa, etc. This demonstrates the close-knit nature of the community he grew up in. Another reason that it is family is because that is what he felt everyone was to him, creating a strong sense of belonging. A reason that it is love is because he loved everyone in his family. They always came over and had dinner, babysat him, and did everything, indicating a deep affection and caring that defined their relationships; that is why it is love. Ultimately, the pervasive sense of family and love shapes the overall emotional tone of Rodriguez's memoir.
421	12247	5	3	As I read the article, also called memoir, I didn't so much find a certain mood that the author had created. This memoir is indeed heart warming and touching, though it is very inspirational. It teaches, at least it taught me, that if you can dream something then you can do it. Narciso's parents most likely did dream of coming to america to raise a family and they accomplished with a little hope and hard work. If I had to say what mood this author created I would say happiness. The reason for that is because Narciso was not rich in the sense of money but rich in the sense of love, happiness, and family cultures. For example, as this article said, his parents had a talent for cooking which was passed down to Narciso and he was grateful, showing the positive impact of their heritage. Another example is that he was filled with joy and happiness just because of who is family and neighbors were and how he spent his life living around them, illustrating the contentment he found in community. Ultimately, the memoir's pervasive feeling is one of joy derived from simple yet profound connections.
422	12248	5	3	"The author of the memoir set a mood in the writing. The mood of thankfulness and humbleness was set in the writing piece. The word grateful was repeated over and over again. Since the author emphasized the word it gives a reader an idea that he truly is thankful for his parents and childhood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" this is an example of the author showing his gratitude towards his parents. While reading this piece it gave me a warm feeling. Even though the author's parents had a hard time when they moved to @LOCATION1 they gave the author a good childhood with happy memories. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This is how the author looks at his memories. They are always cheerful and warm, filling the narrative with a sense of nostalgia. In the last sentence of the memoir he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that he is grateful for having so many good relationships with lots of people and that it didn't matter how small their house was, the author's parents helped bring it to life, and for that he is grateful, demonstrating the profound impact of family love and connection."
423	12249	5	3	He is very greatfull to live in @LOCATION1, and even with all the racism he still found ways to have fun and enjoy life, building strong friendships and participating in community events.
424	12250	5	3	The @CAPS1 created by the @CAPS2 is happy, @CAPS3 was happy that @CAPS3 got to live in @LOCATION2 and be raised in @LOCATION2. @CAPS3 happy because shes lived In the Same house in New Jersey all her life then finally got to meet her grandparents In 1970 When @CAPS3 turned @NUM1 years old. @CAPS3 Is also happy because @CAPS3 Is older and has alot of memorys In the house and Is happy @CAPS3 lives In a free country. The joy of these experiences, from childhood to adulthood, contributes to a sense of contentment and gratitude for the life @CAPS3 has lived.
425	12251	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very thankful and happy. Narciso does a very good job of showing his moods, like when he says, ""Growing up in this environment it instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" Here, you can tell that the mood is happy because of the way he says how his family would welcome anyone into their family, but it also shows that if you grow up in a good family environment, you're also going to want to invest those lessons into your own kids' lives. Another example of mood is the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Not only does it show again that what you learn when you are little you always want for your family, but it also shows that you cannot call a house a home till you are able to live there with your family and the home always has a good mood in it. In the end, the mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez reflects the proper, but not only way, to have a good mood in your home. It's a testament to the lasting impact of a positive upbringing and the desire to recreate that for future generations."
426	12252	5	3	"A happy, grateful, and proud mood is expressed by the author in this memoir. The author, Narciso, expressed a grateful and happy mood by describing things his parents did for him that he was grateful for, as well as happy to have. ""... a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The author also expressed his pride in the story, by stating and describing what his parent's did that he was proud of. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) ""they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) The author's fond recollections highlight the sacrifices his parents made. In conclusion, these feelings of happiness, gratitude, and pride effectively convey the author's deep appreciation for his upbringing and family history."
427	12253	5	3	"The mood created by the author was very happy. The author was grateful to his parents. For example in paragraph @NUM1: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author thanks his parents repeatedly for their strength.

428	12254	5	3	The memoir created a happy mood. Living in America is great. They had a better chance in life then being cuba. America has alot of oportinitys and staying together. Having friends come over relatives and non- relatives is great. You have a better mood in the day to come.
429	12255	5	3	The mood that the author created in this memoir is kinda sad because these immigrants came to America selflessly just to give their children a better life. These immigrants do not have a lot to work with. They live in small homes that are dirty but in a surprising way, they manage. All these immigrants from different cultures that live in the same neighborhood came together in great solidarity and friendship, often sharing what little they had. There are other immigrants that are unlucky and don't find jobs or houses; they have to either leave or stay temporarily with other people until they get back on their feet, highlighting the precariousness of their situation. In conclusion, in this memoir, the author created a very sad mood, as you can see from some of the specific details from the story I have included, ultimately painting a picture of hardship and resilience.
430	12256	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", is a mixture of happiness, relaxation, and gratefulness, even though the memoir sometimes states how his parents had to give up their jobs in Cuba, and how overt racism was normal and segregation prevailed in the United States at the time, giving the mood as sadness, the article mainly consists of happy memories. An example of this can be found throughout the story, especially in the ending paragraph when Narciso Rodriguez sums up the memoir and expresses how grateful he was toward his parents and the childhood he had. Also in the third and fourth paragraphs when he talks about his neighbors and how everybody got along with each other, and how they frequently had meals together, I find the mood to be relaxing in paragraph three and four also, but mainly in paragraph one when he talks about his kitchen and the smells, aromas, and music that used to dance through the air. The overall mood of the memoir could be considered gratefulness. It could be considered gratefulness because Narciso Rodriguez always states how grateful he is for his parents and childhood, ultimately shaping the positive tone that permeates the narrative."
431	12257	5	3	The mood in the story is very homely and happiness. The author clearly loved their childhood and was filled by great experiences and a loving background. The author was very greatful for the parents for what they have done. For moving to @LOCATION1, making sacrifices, wanting a better life for them. Also how their home was a great enviroment, always open, cozy, and loving. The mood of the cooking, family coming together, and of the cheerful music is just great, showcasing the warmth and joy that permeated their upbringing and fostered a deep sense of appreciation.
432	12258	5	3	The mood of this memoir is a good one. It describes how a house is not the same as a home (last sentence in memoir) and how family is more than just blood relatives, showing that the true essence of belonging lies in the connections and love shared, rather than the physical structure or genetic ties. This understanding ultimately emphasizes the warmth and positivity found within chosen families.
433	12259	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. It symbolizes togetherness and coming together as a family. In this passage everyone is caring and open to anyone living with them. The child in this story talks about how grateful they are for their parents. They're happy because they're all a family living together as one. Everyone is accepting of one another. Overall, I think the mood is happy and reflects the strong family bonds.
434	12260	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness because the memoir describes the many cherished memories within his house, evoking a sense of joy. This feeling of happiness is further amplified by his mention of family and friends, and the peaceful atmosphere he associates with them. The vibrant Cuban music that fills the air also contributes to the uplifting mood. His description of his house's location and his passion for cooking, which he portrays as a rich culinary experience he deeply loves, adds another layer to the overall feeling of contentment, solidifying the memoir's happy tone.

The memoir begins with Rodriguez explaining her Cuban heritage and how big of a role that played in her life. This creates an idea of pride and love for who you are. Narciso goes on to say how her parents were always welcoming and inviting and how they sacrificed basically their whole life so they could make a better life for their children. This paints a picture of a close-knit family, bound by love and a shared cultural identity. In the final paragraphs, the author expresses pure gratitude for everything her parents have given up and done. In one line Rodriguez praises parents when she thanks them again saying, ""there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" All of these details contribute to the overall mood of the memoir, leaving the reader with a sense of warmth and appreciation for the sacrifices parents make."

Here he describes how the people in his neighborhood acted towards each other. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" The people in his neighborhood were very kind and generous people. They help each other whenever one is in need. The author makes the reader smile when reading about such a place. Another example of this is when he writes, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" To see such selfless act is just wonderful. The way the people sacrificed their lives for their child's is amazing. Reading about this just warms a person's heart, demonstrating the hopeful spirit that permeated the community. Another example proving this mood is when the author writes, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The author is very proud of where he grew. It might not have been perfect but he managed to find the good parts.

One way I can explain the **sense of home** created by the author in the **excerpt** is that he is so grateful for having parents that care about him and want him to get a good education. The second way is that **he** is always happy at his home; he always has some Cuban spirit in his house. His parents cook Cuban food and have their family together.

440	12266	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy setting. In the memoir, the setting is a happy setting, in a sense of living because in the passage, there are parenthesis that explain how much the narrator appreciates his family and his heritage. In the passage in paragraph @NUM1, it explains how the families are close and help those in need, even when things aren't going so smoothly for them. Also there are certain words in the passage that would help with the mood, words such as selflessly, solidarity, love, friendship, and sacrifice.

The author sets the tone of the struggle by describing the author's parents first home ""A furnished one-room apartment,"" and that ""racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States."" This explains how her family had a hard time with money and that people were racist to them because of their background. But, then the author describes how the author overcame the struggle of her parents and the racism by uniting with all the other immigrants living in their neighborhood. ""Despite customs elsewhere , all of these cultures came together in greater solidarity and friendship"". This sets the tone that even though there were many bad things going on, they overcame it.

It also describes how grateful he is toward his parents and how proud he is of his Cuban culture.

This reciprocal belief fostered an environment of trust and deep affection, making love a palpable presence within those walls.

447	12273	5	3	The mood in the memoir was created in a couple of different ways by the author. One of the moods that was created in the memoir was happiness. Back in his past, his parents shared all of their Cuban family recipes, they had a lot of family and friend celebrations with the rest of the neighborhood, sharing friendship and helping others in need. The family and the neighbors all came together as one big family to be happy and to make a happy community, and that made the memoir happy. Another mood that was created by the author was sadness. At the end of the memoir, the author went back to the present, talking about the past times. At the end, he thanks his parents for everything.

He makes it seem like not having any money is the best way to live. That even though you left your family, friends, jobs everything is okay because you are with each other. You are with your family but they are not your blood family.

Through these details, the author paints a vivid picture of his childhood, highlighting the importance of family, heritage, and community in shaping his early years."
466	12292	5	3	The mood in the memoir is happy and thankful. I think this because the memoir is talking about how this boy appreciates that his parents moved just so he can have a better life. I know this because in the last paragraph the boy talks about his family and how he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house to a home. So thats the mood of the memoir, and it is clear that he cherishes the sacrifices made for him.
467	12293	5	3	"In the memoir, the author created a mood, a very good one that shows everyone that reads it that the human race can be genuinely kind and helpful. No matter what race you are or where you come from, you don't have to be blood related to be ""family,"" and we can all extend a hand to the people that need the most help. The author's parents gave him great love and sacrificed a lot for him; @CAPS1 is very thankful to them for that. @CAPS1 tells them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than @CAPS1 could've ever done, and @CAPS1 has great admiration for their strength and perseverance. Being an immigrant, you have to be unselfish because most parents do it to give their children a better life, often leaving behind everything familiar for their sake. The author learned the real definition of ""family,"" finding it in unexpected places, and for that, @CAPS1 said @CAPS1'll never forget that house or the many things about how to love. In the memoir, it creates a peaceful mood, reflecting on the warmth and acceptance found within those walls, ultimately illustrating the enduring power of love and sacrifice."
468	12294	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is to never forget what home is if you ever move away or you grow up and you move. It's okay, because you will have better memories there at your new house, and also if you have the nastiest house, you can always make it into the cleanest house; it just takes time and effort. Everyone can do it, regardless of appearance or anything else, and no matter what your house looks like, you still are you, and that inherent worth remains constant, shaping your identity.
469	12295	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir is loving and happiness, clearly reflecting his affection for his parents. The mood was one of happiness and love toward his two parents, exemplified by the quote: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The mood also shows that the author had a great childhood and loved his neighborhood very much. He expresses this sentiment when he says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" Furthermore, the mood the author created also demonstrated that he didn't care if they didn't have a lot of money; he loved where he lived and all the people that lived there, even if they weren't blood relatives. This is highlighted in the quote, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" To wrap it all up, the mood the author created in the memoir was indeed about love and happiness, painting a warm and appreciative picture of his upbringing."
470	12296	5	3	"The author in the memoir tried to create a specific mood. This mood is appreciation. He is saying all the things he is thankful for. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly..."" In this quote he is thanking and appreciating all the work his parents went through to give him a good life. He is also admiring the things they went through such as leaving behind their families, and careers in the country they loved. The author reflects on their sacrifices with deep respect. He is grateful for the house he lived in and he looks back at the memories of them cooking in the kitchen again, with the smells of Cuban foods, and sounds of Cuban music. These sensory details further emphasize his gratitude for the warmth and love that filled his childhood home. He expresses all of this in the last few lines of the memoir that state: ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" In conclusion, the author's memoir is all about his appreciation of the good things that came to him in his childhood, and the memories he will never forget."
471	12297	5	3	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives the author leaves a friendly, compassionate, and graceful mood. This excerpt leaves a friendly mood because of how much friendliness was given by Narciso Rodriguez's neighborhood at his young age. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" Also, this excerpt leaves a compassionate mood because of how much compassion Narciso's parents showed to families of friends who needed a push or help to stand on their feet once again. ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family..."" Rodriguez leaves a grateful mood when he continues to thank his parents for their love. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... Admiration for their strength and perseverance... and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" Rodriguez uses these wonderful moods to describe his wonderful parents, highlighting the positive impact of their values and community on his life."
472	12298	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one that is used in lots of memoirs because they are like things someone will never forget, like the author said, ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" These sensory details evoke a warm and nostalgic feeling, highlighting the enduring impact of childhood experiences. Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. That's all stuff that he will never forget, showcasing how deeply ingrained these memories are and establishing a connection between the past and present. This emphasis on lasting impressions is a common thread in memoirs, as authors often seek to explore the formative moments that continue to shape their lives."
473	12299	5	3	"The mood in this memoir ranges from happiness to love. One type of mood in this story is uplifting happiness. You can see that because throughout the story there is so much positivity and warmth. It is almost contagious how the author tells the story of his cherished years of childhood which is made up of happiness. One example is, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote emphasizes the happiness and uplifting cheer from the authors endless childhood of home. Another mood this memoir gives is gratefulness and gratitude to the authors family and home. For example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote shows that the author can only give thanks to his loving parents who did everything to insure a great life. The author grew up loving his home filled with culture and family. A third mood in this memoir is compassion and dedication. This memoir shows that because even with moving to a new country with new people the family still keeps his childhood filled with culture of who they are. They don't hide it because of their struggles and hardships or anything. An example of compassion and dedication is, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This quote shows that they keep constant custom of their cultures warmth and dedication. Nothing has stopped them from living life how they chose, showcasing the powerful influence of family bonds and cultural identity in shaping the author’s life and fostering a deep appreciation for his roots."
474	12300	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting. The mood created by the author is lifting because it shows that race doesn't matter when it comes to unity or friendship, highlighting a sense of hope. It is also lifting because Narciso's parents gave up everything and everyone so that their family can live a better life, demonstrating resilience and sacrifice. Another reason why it is lifting is because in the story it talks about how the family doesn't have to be necessarily blood related and can be someone you love and will help you, illustrating the power of chosen family. That is why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting, ultimately suggesting a brighter outlook despite past hardships.
475	12301	5	3	Originally from Cuba, Maria and her two-year-old son, @PERSON1, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a furnished one-room apartment, in 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a three-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life. Now we have a good life because of the move to the United States, a testament to their sacrifices and the opportunities this country offered.
476	12302	5	3	"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very warm and calm. There can be a lot of drama in a family, but Rodriguez cherishes his background and how much he loves his family and the people in his neighborhood. In paragraph two, he says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" In the first paragraph Narciso discusses how he takes pride in his culture. He says, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" Narciso Rodriguez's love and gratefulness are evident in this excerpt, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" showcasing the positive influence of his family and community on his life."
477	12303	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was grateful in the beginning of his memoir. Evidence from the text that supported this is paragraph @NUM1 it stated ""(and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" The second mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was thankful. He was thankful because his parents were immigrants and came to the country without knowing any language or the culture. The last mood created by the author in the memoir was that he felt loved. He felt loved because his parents sacrificed for him. They welcomed many things in Narciso's life. These three moods demonstrate the author's deep appreciation for his upbringing and the sacrifices his parents made."
478	12304	5	3	The mood the author created was a good mood. It is a good mood because it is telling you about his life he has. He has a good life because he has good and nice parents, who provide him with love and support. He is wealthy, enjoying comforts and opportunities. He has no trouble like getting punished, suggesting a harmonious home environment. His parents are wealthy and they have a good job, ensuring financial stability. The author did a good job make this story happy and not sad, successfully creating a positive and uplifting tone.
479	12305	5	3	"The mood in the @ORGANIZATION1 is displayed as happiness and appreciation. Narciso understands how much his parents had given up for him by moving from Cuba to @LOCATION1. They also have always stood by his side and made sure there was only positive attitudes around him. He appreciates this so much he ends the @ORGANIZATION1 saying ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". By this he is saying it was a house that could shelter you, but a home is somewhere you want to be with family where you feel safe and comfortable. The happiness comes from the appreciation because you can't appreciate something and it doesn't make you a little bit happier. His happiness is also portrayed in paragraph @NUM1 where he starts by saying ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"", further solidifying the positive atmosphere and the deeply felt gratitude that permeates the @ORGANIZATION1."
480	12306	5	3	The mood created by the author, @PERSON1, is a upbeat & happy mood. I know this because he states that he is very grateful for his parents to pass down the cooking recipes and skills, and the Cuban music that they would listen to. This appreciation for his heritage and upbringing contributes to the overall positive feeling. This is the mood @PERSON1 creates in the memoir.
481	12307	5	3	The mood in the memoir, that the author is trying to **convey** you is that it is calm, and in its own way the mood Kind of leads to forgiveness and **understanding**. Because the memoir is mostly trying to tell you that no matter where you go you never forget about your family, and that the memories are much better then the reality that you live in. And no matter how far you decide to go, to a different Country, never forget who gave you birth and who loves you, which really means family and friends. But the **character** that they describe in the **memoir**, he decides to leave his family to go to America and to get an education, and do something big with his life. And he is going through other things too, like the other People are thinking of him as an immigrant, and how the rest of the family **eventually** leave there **homeland**. But the family to them, that really didn't mean anything to them; in their house they left their door open to any family that needs help, or that they're going through the same thing as what their family is going through. So that's the mood that the author is trying to describe to you, highlighting the persistent pull of familial bonds despite geographical distance and personal ambition.
482	12308	5	3	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author displays a mood. The mood is very calm and grateful as he explains how he feels to have his Cuban culture and lifestyle, a heritage he clearly cherishes. Explaining how his family loves cooking traditional dishes and playing music fills him with joy. The author just explains how he lived when he was with his parents, painting a picture of a warm and loving home. Then the author gets more detailed talking about who lived with him like his landlord and his daughter; his two grandparents and others, further emphasizing the importance of community and extended family in his upbringing. The author just creates a calm and grateful mood to this memoir, reflecting on the simple joys of family, culture, and shared living.
483	12309	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is a specific mood created. The mood is proud, because the author goes on about how amazing their parents are & how inviting the house was. In the memoir it says, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This showcases the author’s pride in their heritage and upbringing. The author talks about how his/her home was full of Cuban culture and how great Cuban food is. The author also says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative... In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The author is grateful and proud because her parents welcomed with open arms people of all types, creating a strong sense of community. The author was also proud that he/she was so close with neighbors that they were like relatives, highlighting the warmth and inclusivity of their environment. This strong sense of belonging and acceptance contributes significantly to the overall proud mood that permeates the memoir. This is why the mood created in the memoir is proud."
484	12310	5	3	The mood of the story is happy. Everyone spends time with their family, having fun together, celebrating together would give you a happy feeling of what a family is. It's like how the family in the story moved to the United States; they first didn't know anyone, they had no friends. They were living in an apartment that had one room, but years later, they moved to a 4-room apartment. There lived a family with a newborn baby above them. The baby is the job for the main character (babysitter) and also the main character's first friend. To the main character, friendships and home are very important to him. If there are no friendships and home, there will be no love. These taught the main character how to love and how to care about someone else. The main character said friendship and home is the basis in his life, he understands without letting his parents teach him. When you have friendship, home, and love, everything will be perfect for you. All you need is support from your family, which is the most important thing. You will be always happy and feel very lucky that you have all of these things.
485	12311	5	3	The mood the author created was how happy Narciso was because her parents gave up so much for her to have a better life and education in America. This happiness stemmed from a deep appreciation for their sacrifices, knowing they endured hardship to provide her with opportunities they themselves never had. It was a gratitude that fueled her determination to succeed and make their efforts worthwhile.
486	12312	5	3	"The @CAPS1 author is trying to make the reader understand Narciso Rodriguez's feelings by describing how little Narciso had grown up with and how hard it must have been for him to live in that type of environment and home. for example ""In 1961 i was born into this simple house, situated two-family, blond brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" This quote @CAPS4 shows how even from his early days being as a child Narciso was still living in poor environments and did not have much at all. The @CAPS1 author @CAPS4 shows the unhappiness in the Rodriguez family and how they are struggling to make everything better @CAPS2 towards the end of the memoir the @CAPS1 author @CAPS4 demonstrates the happiness and how proud the family is because they are now doing a lot better than they were before. for example ""I will never forget how my parents turned a house into a home"". Again this great quote @CAPS4 demonstrates how proud they are to be living in a much better place and environment, and had to struggle to get where they are now, ultimately conveying the family's resilience and their appreciation for their improved circumstances."
487	12313	5	3	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez a non-nostalgic mood is created from his memories. The mood is created by his parents and where he lives. One way the mood is non-nostalgic is he's grateful towards his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). By being grateful towards his parents for their sacrifices, he is helping the non-nostalgic mood grow. Also, where he lived helps the mood. ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home those"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). Since his parents turned his house into a home, he will never forget what they did for him, making this memoir more non-nostalgic, as it focuses on appreciation rather than longing. In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he creates a non-nostalgic mood from the memories of his past."
488	12314	5	3	There are few moods created. They are comfort, Love and sacrifice. Comfort because of the way @PERSON1 described his home, parents, and neigborhood families. Love because his parents loved him and each other very much, and they cared about what they did and their family. Sacrifice because his parents sacrificed their comforting home to move to @LOCATION1 for their son. That was difficult for them, but @ORGANIZATION1 appreciated that. He loves his parents for what they did for him, revealing a deep sense of gratitude for their selfless act, which ultimately strengthens the emotional resonance of the narrative.
489	12315	5	3	There were many moods set by the author in the memoir. One of the moods was happiness. Narciso had a very happy family. They had many friends and were thankful. Another mood the author set was being proud. He was so proud to have parents who cared so much and had such selflessness. A third mood in the memoir is love. Narciso and his family were loved by many, and they also loved many back. His parents' arms and doors were open at all times for anybody needing to get back on their feet. Narciso was grateful to have such a great family (including extended). Throughout this memoir, there were moods of caring, loving, gratefulness, & happiness. Those were the moods the author set into this memoir, creating a heartwarming and positive reading experience.
490	12316	5	3	The mood created by the author was very grateful and outgoing. The person was very grateful to grow up and be able to live in Miami. He loved how his parents gave up everything and were selfless so their kids could live normal lives and do what they wanted to do. The kids' parents were very outgoing because they gave up everything they had in their lives in Cuba, so they could give everything they ever wanted to their kids in Miami. Their sacrifice and outgoing spirit ultimately allowed their children to thrive.
491	12317	5	3	In the non-fiction book *The @CAPS1 prints of our lives* by Narciso Rodriguez, he talks about his family and where he lived before he was this famous fashion designer. The mood that is given off by this biography is a sad and happy mood. He talks about his family, who were originally from Cuba and how they arrived in the United States in 1956. He said that after living for a year in a furnished one-room apartment, he moved into a three-room apartment that he would call home and where he made many happy memories. Alegria was his baby-sitter and became his first friend. Narciso Rodriguez gives the story a mood that is very uplifting and sad at the same time, painting a portrait of both hardship and hope.
492	12318	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy, loving, and thankful mood. Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. This vibrant description paints a picture of a lively and joyful home, instantly evoking happiness. ""Growing up in this environment it instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Here he is talking about the fact that he loves his family, emphasizing the deep bonds he shares, even beyond blood, which fosters a loving mood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Expressing his deep appreciation, he shows he was thankful for his parents for what they did for him so that makes me feel thankful for my parents. That was the mood I felt created by the author in the memoir, a powerful combination of joy, affection, and gratitude that resonates deeply with the reader."
493	12319	5	3	"I think the mood of the story is being grateful. I think this because in the story it says Narciso thanks his parents for their love and sacrifice. Also because in the story, Narciso says that his parents turned a simple house into a home, showing their dedication and care. And he says that ""the warmth of the kitchen of his humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love,"" further emphasizing the nurturing environment they created. Therefore, it is clear that the story evokes a sense of gratitude for the loving and supportive upbringing Narciso experienced."
494	12320	5	3	In this memoir, the mood is very pleasant and makes you think of childhood memories. The reason is because he talks about how his parents guided him to be a strong-willed man, and he couldn't have done it unless he had the conditions he did then. He seems to think that if he didn't have the parents and opportunities he did then, his life would have been much different. So, the mood in this memoir makes you feel like home is where the heart is, suggesting a deep appreciation for the nurturing environment that shaped his character and ultimately highlighting the profound impact of family and upbringing on one's life trajectory.

496	12322	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is reflective and celebratory. First, the mood of history is that the author wanted to represent the history of a family that came to @LOCATION1, likely seeking a new life. Second, the history is nice because the son of the family was born in the @LOCATION1, suggesting a successful integration and a new chapter, and the author tried to represent the nationality of a @CAPS1, possibly highlighting the unique identity the child possesses, that the parents are other nationality, they Know how to live with son, embracing their child's dual heritage.

It's grateful well because the author talks about how thankful he is that he has such loving parents who risked and sacrificed their jobs, and left everything they had back in Cuba to go to the United States where they did not know the language, had no money, and at the moment no shelter. I know it is grateful because the author clearly says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This pin-points the mood, as well as throughout the excerpt the author speaks about his gratefulness to his parents. In conclusion, the mood towards the article I think happens to be grateful."
499	12325	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is loving. The mood of the memoir is loving because Narciso's home reminds him of his old country, Cuba. The author talks about his grand parents not being able to come to @LOCATION1, Miami, until 1970. Narciso's house was turned into a home that reminded him of Cuba; the sights, sounds, and even the smells evoked a sense of nostalgia and longing for the island, establishing a deep connection to his heritage and fostering a loving atmosphere.
500	12326	5	3	The memoir's mood reflects a deep appreciation for family culture, portraying a home where family friends were always welcome, emphasizing its importance.

I know this because the memoir says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote really shows that Narciso is thankfull for his parent's love for him. This mood comes out in the memoir when Narciso says ""But, in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important Family and Values are."" This quote shows how he is thankfull for his Family, but also how his Family shaped him as a person and instilled important values in him. In all, There are many emotions in this story, but the one that stood out to me the most was him being gratefull, which truly highlights the positive impact his family had on his life and development."
502	12328	5	3	The author created a mood of immense gratefulness. The author knows that not every family (Cuban or possibly American) can all get together and be truly happy and grateful for what they have. Not every family can work well with everyone else. Not every family can have the satisfaction of sharing and giving to others. This is a feeling of gratefulness because of the parents. The author consistantly praises them on their courageous acts, and even going against the law to help those in need. The parents brought such happiness by welcoming those who are different and sharing happiness with them. The author had an incredible experience and is eternally grateful for having such wonderful parents that she had. Because of them, she understands the importance of family and compassion.
503	12329	5	3	"The mood created by the author of the memoir is thankfulness.

The author explained her gratefulness by telling her parents that what they did was much more courageous than she could ever do, a testament to their strength and resilience. The author also said that there was no way to express her gratitude for the generosity impressed upon her at such an early age, a generosity that shaped her life and instilled in her a deep sense of appreciation for their unwavering support. In conclusion, the author expresses deep gratitude for her parents' sacrifices, recognizing the profound impact of their courageous move and generous spirit on her own life.
505	12331	5	3	The author gave a loving mood in the memoir. I know this because he did not talk badly about anything and he talked about how his parents helped him and other people as a kit. In paragraph two he was talking about how his house was nice and comfortable. I know this because he says the love of cooking and the passionate Cuban music. These details create a sense of warmth and fondness, reinforcing the loving mood that permeates the memoir.
506	12332	5	3	"The mood that was created in this memoir was a basic mood. It wasn't a happy or sad mood; it was a flat mood, because it's talking about how they're in debt and needed to move, and the kid lost all of his friends. The kid can't attend school because they can't afford any type of education, so that is why it's a basic or flat mood. I also believe it's a basic mood because it says that ""kids have to do a lot of the work"" because they are the youngest, and the older kids can't do that work or they will get hurt. Towards the end, it gets to a happy mood because it says ""my parents will always be there for me,"" which ultimately offers a sense of comfort despite the hardships described earlier."
507	12333	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was very loving, thankful, and happy. The author described the love of his family throughout this memoir and his friends also. He thanks his parents for giving him a good life and he is grateful for their love and sacrafice, showing appreciation for all they have done. He also describes happiness in the kitchen, the heart of the house, where warmth and delicious aromas filled the air. Ultimately, the author conveys a sense of contentment and appreciation for the positive relationships and experiences that have shaped his life.
508	12334	5	3	"In the memoir @PERSON1 written by @PERSON1 the mood is happiness. First, Rodriguez writes, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)"" (paragraph @NUM1). Narciso's parents have a great skill and love for cooking, now Narciso has a great love and skill for cooking as well, passed down through generations. Both of which he is still happy to have today. Finally, @PERSON1 writes, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into home"" (paragraph @NUM2). Narciso learned about love in the house. His parents had a @NUM3 room house, but they were able to turn it into a home filled with love and warmth. The size of the house does not matter, it matters who you are there with and the memories created. In conclusion Narciso is grateful and happy for everything his parents have done for him and the loving environment they created."
509	12335	5	3	"@PERSON1 wrote this memoir in a happy, warm, senseful way. He was able to describe in great detail what went on in his house during his childhood and how caring and loving his parents were, showing their affection. Not just to him but to almost anybody. Anyone that was considered family was allowed in, welcomed with open arms, and he was also grateful to be Cuban and for the foods he was able to eat and the beautiful aromas in his Cuban kitchen, especially the spices. His description of this home is very soothing to me because it just has a happy background and his talk so highly of it. It is a tempting place to attend life in this ""make the best of"" little Cuban home."
510	12336	5	3	I think the mood the author created was proud and happy because he got to come to the United States and live a better life as an immigrant. He also got to get a better education, and he is proud and thankful to have parents like that, shaping his journey.
511	12337	5	3	The mood the author gave in the speech was a very happy, thoughtful, respectful, thankful, moved when he explained his reason and his thoughts; him expressing his family life was very nice. He said the best things his parents did for him was to leave their family in Cuba and start a new life in America for a new life and future. Also, he expressed that he always thanked his parents for what they have done for him, but he knew that wasn't the best way; it was just that he had to prove he was thankful, showing appreciation not just through words, but through actions and accomplishments.
512	12338	5	3	The life @PERSON1 lived as a child was a paradise in his eyes. He learned what a family really was, people who cares for eachother no matter what. And in his eyes, his whole community was one big family. His parents were kind, giving and generous to everyone. Despite the different customs elsewhere, all of these cultures were united as one family. They would lend a hand for anyone who needed it, because they know that they'd do the same for them. Throughout his life, he'd never forget his wonderful childhood and all the things he was taught, @CAPS1 and Generosity, values that shaped his character and guided his actions.
513	12339	5	3	"In this memoir, @PERSON1, he is feeling loving when he wrote this. One @CAPS1 is when he says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give there children a better life..."" is showing an @CAPS1 of love. Also, when he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Last @CAPS1 is when he said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" In this memoir, you can tell @PERSON1 really cares about his family, especially his loving parents, demonstrating deep appreciation for their efforts and devotion."
514	12340	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author, Narciso Rodriguez created a mood throughout the memoir of his home and Family. Narciso talks about how lucky he was to have had such a wonderful home where he belonged and a family that was always there for him. Narciso put it best in the last few lines of his memoir that say ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" A big mood in the memoir was a feeling of warmth and happiness, an environment where everyone was family, a strong sense of community, togetherness and belonging, that love, care, family and friendship is always there, and that this was home, always and forever. ""In our neighborhood,... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need... My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we consider family, knowing they would do the same for us."" Another mood in the memoir was a feeling of strong love and gratefulness Narciso felt for his parents. They were strong, courageous, selfless and brave, and they gave up so much to give Narciso a better life. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Ultimately, the author successfully created a mood of love, gratitude, and belonging surrounding his home and family in the memoir, ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."""
515	12341	5	3	"The author has many moods in the memoir. One of his moods is that he is happy. ""A cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and Love"". This quote shows that he is happy and content in the environment he is in. Another mood is that he is grateful. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This proves that he is grateful for everything they have done for him throughout his life. These instances showcase the author's emotional range within the memoir, highlighting both joy and appreciation."
516	12342	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood created by the author centers on a Cuban immigrant experience, depicting Narciso's parents' journey to America. Arriving without knowing the language and with little money, they ultimately found success. However, the path was arduous, a testament to their resilience and the source of Narciso's deep gratitude. She also recounts how many people have passed through their lives, highlighting her parents' generosity and willingness to help others, opening their home and hearts to those in need. This constant influx shaped their family dynamic and reinforced the importance of community and support."
517	12343	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is gratefulness. This memoir is basically about how grateful the author is to his parents. The author is grateful to his parents because of their love and sacrifice. The quote, ""In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely."" From this quote, I can see why the author is grateful. His parents decided to immigrate to give him a better life, at the expense of their families, friends, jobs, and their country. Another reason why the author was grateful was because the author learned that ""family"" was not just a blood relative, but much more. In the piece of text, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of those cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" From this snippet, I can tell that the author was grateful for learning the true meaning of family. He learned a ""family"" was a unity of people that helped each other. This broadened his understanding of human connection. The reason why the author was grateful was because of their courage. In the text, the quote, ""They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" From this quote, I can gather that his parents were grateful. Most people would've given up from the tall and wide barrier in their way. His parents could've given up, but they didn't. I think it's reasonable the authors should be grateful for his parent's courage. In conclusion, I believe the mood of the memoir is gratefulness, because the author's parents have done everything they could to make it easier for him. Their sacrifices resonate deeply and form the foundation of his appreciation."
518	12344	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy mood because the memoir is about how one parent sacrificed all they have for their child, and then they changed a house into a lifetime of good memories. This dedication and transformation naturally evoke feelings of warmth and joy in the reader. Ultimately, the narrative creates a sense of happiness through its depiction of familial love and the creation of lasting bonds.
519	12345	5	3	The author is telling us a story about a kid that Just came to the United States. He is only @NUM1 years old & he likes it. A man named narciso @PERSON1 is a memoir to all the people. The boy, barely @NUM1 years old, found wonder in everything new. Narciso @PERSON1's story resonated deeply as a reminder of the immigrant experience.
520	12346	5	3	In this memoir, the author makes the mood happy. One example is when they talk about all being a family and letting people stay, emphasizing the warmth and acceptance within their community. Another is when they are talking about the racism and other hardships faced, but highlights how the neighbors have united in support and solidarity, showcasing resilience. All in all, despite challenges, the mood for the memoir was happy, ultimately conveying a sense of hope and togetherness.
521	12347	5	3	The overall mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, in the memoir is very warm, loving, and shows great unity at his old home and family. In paragraph 1, Narciso talks about the great selflessness and courage that his parents had when they immigrated to America. Narciso talks about how grateful he is to them, for leaving their homeland so that he could have a better life. During the second and third paragraphs of the memoir, Narciso describes the warmth and generosity of his family. He also showed how family doesn't necessarily mean a blood relative. His family came from Cuba, but there were also other cultures in their neighborhood such as Puerto Ricans, and also Spanish immigrants as well This loving and extremely rich cultural background that he had lived in as a child showed great unity between different types of people. Narciso's family's door was always open to anyone in need. Narciso Rodriguez's definition of family, shows that his background was full of sharing, joy, and love all squeezed into his small apartment in New Jersey, showcasing the strong sense of community and togetherness that defined his upbringing.
522	12348	5	3	"In today's aspects, @PERSON1 wouldn't be considered wealthy, but underneath material possessions, he is more wealthy than most people will ever be. For example, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a relative."" Family is very valuable, and a great wealth to Narciso, and throughout the memoir he keeps bringing up the feelings of family and connection. It's seems like that emotion was the glue that held everything together and would make it all ok! He also experiences great gratitude towards his parents and his neighbors; ""But in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit and generosity impressed on me at such an early age and be demonstration of how important family and friends are."" I think the overall mood of this memoir is very warm, and optimistic about life, highlighting the power of human connection. They make the best of their situation, and that really made an impression on Narciso. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" showcasing that true wealth lies not in material possessions, but in the love and support of family and community."
523	12349	5	3	"The mood created by the author is nostalgic, appreciative, and relaxing. I think that because all he's talking about is his family and how much his parents did for him. For example in paragraph 2 it says ""I will never forget how my Parents turned this simple house into a home."" To me that sounds like appreciative because he knows he can always come home to his Parents if he ever need help. Another example is in paragraph 3 it says ""I learned there about how to love"". That to me sounds like when he was growing up it was rough and he never actually loved some one in his life until now, and he's fondly remembering those formative years. Ultimately, these details contribute to a feeling of peaceful contentment and gratitude towards his family."
524	12350	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is immense gratitude, happiness, and admiration. Rodriguez describes his home and writes, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@NUM1). Rodriguez expresses happiness reminiscing about his home that was ""warm."" Furthermore, the mood shows admiration towards his parents. Rodriguez writes, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"" (@NUM2). Rodriguez admires his parents for coming to @LOCATION1, ready to work hard, despite the problem of knowing nothing about the country. Lastly, the mood can be described as thankfulness, or gratitude. Rodriguez writes, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM3). The house was more than just the physical part; his parents filled it with love and compassion, and Narciso Rodriguez is extremely grateful. The overall mood of the passage is gratefulness and happiness, revealing the profound impact of his upbringing and the love that shaped his life."
525	12351	5	3	"In the memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" Narciso Rodriguez creates a good mood of accomplishment. The mood first develops in the first paragraph, when Narciso writes of his parents immigrating from Cuba and being able to move up from a one room to a three room apartment, showing their initial success in a new country. The second appearance of this mood is when the author writes of how their community came together and helped each other through the segregation and racism of the time period, illustrating their collective resilience and strength. The third and last demonstration of the mood is how the parents took what they could get and made their house, with its mismatched furniture and hand-me-downs, into a home filled with love and warmth. Accomplishment, born from humble beginnings and communal support, is the mood effectively created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives""."
526	12352	5	3	"The mood of this memoir was appreciative. The author reflects upon his experiences at home in a positive manner which expresses the fact that he is thankful for what he had. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful) (paragraph @NUM1). This quote shows Narciso's appreciation for the culinary skills his parents passed down to him. The extra information in the parentheses also provide a grateful tone to the piece of writing. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The language used (grateful) shows the intence thankfulness he feels. Throughout the entire reading the word ""grateful"" is used repeadtly. The use of repetition provides a reader with the knowledge that that word is very important. So grateful appears to be a keyword. Also, later in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed on me at such a young age."" There is so much passion in this phrase. ""There is no way to express my gratitude"" shows that he's just so thankful there is not way to even express it. The author really shows the reader that he is appreicative of his family, consistently highlighting the positive impact they had on his life and underscoring the overall appreciative mood of the memoir."
527	12353	5	3	"The mood that Narciso Rodriguez portrayed very strongly in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is gratitude. In the memo I @CAPS1 mentions how thankful @CAPS1 truly is to his parents for giving him a life of family, and happiness, love etc. For example @CAPS1 thanks them for their ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am extremely grateful)."" Narciso is grateful in a way @CAPS1 could never be able to show them his gratitude. ""... I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity..."" Narciso ""will always be greatful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 is greatful for what they did for a better life, for showing him happiness, family, love and sacrifice. This recurring sentiment showcases a deep appreciation for the foundation they provided. Overall the main mood of this memoir is gratitude."
528	12354	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir comes in different ways. The first mood given is grateful, evident in the phrase ""Skills and the love of cooking that is still with me today."" This mood of gratefulness is reinforced by the statement, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Another prominent mood is admiration, exemplified by the author's words, ""I often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" In this memoir, there were a lot of moods, but the ones that stood out from the author were his gratefulness and admiration, illustrating the profound impact his parents had on his life."
529	12355	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez is gratefulness. The author's memoir is grateful, especially according to paragraphs five, six, and seven. Paragraph five talks about how grateful he is for his mother and father to come to the United States with such courage, without having any knowledge of the language or of the culture. ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" is what starts off paragraph six. The author explains how he has been telling his parents of how much more courageous their plan was than his would have ever been. The author also says how he admired how much strength and perseverance his parents had and how he has thanked them repeatedly. His parents taught him two lessons without telling him, but with their lives, ""and these teachings have been the basis of my life"", the author states. Finally in the last paragraph, the very last sentence says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" which ultimately shows how grateful Narciso Rodriguez truly is, solidifying the pervasive mood of thankfulness throughout the selected paragraphs."
530	12356	5	3	The authors @CAPS1 was good because the story is kind of happiness. The feeling left after reading was one of contentment and hope, contributing to its positive reception.
531	12357	5	3	The mood in the memoir can be expressed in many different ways. The memoir is mostly expressed with gratitude from Narciso to his parents. He describes in good detail all the sacrifices his parents made for him, highlighting their unwavering dedication. Leaving behind all their friends and family, the hot climate, and their cultures back in Cuba was a significant uprooting. Another mood expressed in the memoir is love and kindness. Narciso's parents were kind to everyone they encountered, showcasing their generous spirits. They turned their house into a hotel for people who needed help until they were ready to go, offering a safe haven during uncertain times. They had open dinners where friends and family members came, fostering a sense of community. Even when they struggled financially they still let everyone in, demonstrating their selflessness. Narciso's parents made the biggest sacrifice for him, ensuring his well-being and future. What they did for him created the beautiful moods described in the memoir, shaping the narrative with heartfelt appreciation and affection.
532	12358	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was good. Her memoir was good because in 1961 they moved to a simple house only for two-familys with blond-bricks building in the ironbound in @LOCATION1. She also had a good mood because she had her first birthday upon arrival in the country, which further contributes to the overall positive feeling conveyed.
533	12359	5	3	"In this selection family is being defined, and Narciso Rodriguez gives it a whole new definition. Narciso Rodriguez is now a recognized clothing designer, but as a child she also had a great life full of laughter and love. She grew up in a two family home within Newark, New Jersey. I can now smell, hear, and picture the inside of where Narciso grew up. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today, and for which I am eternally grateful."" This sentence gives me an image of that happy family and puts me in a good mood, while it reminds me of my own family and the memories that we share among our kitchen. Passionate Cuban music, which I adore to this day, filled the air mixing with the aromas in the kitchen. This sentence puts me in a really excited mood because it reminds me of when my own house is filled with loud music during the summertime. Narciso Rodriguez definitely created a mood in this selection, and it was a good one."
534	12360	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez is grateful. Throughout the excerpt, it shows his gratefulness towards his life living with his family, his life in his home, and his overall life living in New Jersey. Reading this makes me feel grateful to live in New Jersey. It even mentions in the passage that he's ""grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" It uses words such as ""warm"", which here means friendly, ""aroma"", ""rich"", and ""solidarity"". All these words, and many other words close in meaning, set this mood. In the first paragraph it mentions all the sacrifice that his parents took to get their family to New Jersey. And then it talks about his gratefulness, to truly show the contrast between sacrifice and the state of being grateful. Those are the reasons that point to the mood of this excerpt being grateful, or gratefulness, solidifying the feeling of thankfulness that Rodriguez expresses."
535	12361	5	3	"In the memoir called, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood. In paragraph @NUM1, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The mood is set in this paragraph. It shows and tells how grateful he is for the unwavering support and values instilled in him. Therefore, the pervading mood in the story is undeniably one of thankfulness."
536	12362	5	3	The author, I think, wants to go back to Cuba to see his family and friends. Also, I think the author wants to move back down to Cuba to stay with the rest of his family and friends and maybe take care of an older relative.
537	12363	5	3	"Throughout the story, the author put in details, explained things, and painted pictures in your mind all to set the mood for the story. A few different moods went on in the story but one of the most important was loving, not only was because of how close his neighborhood and family was, but because of the overall bond and unity they had shared but also because the parents ""turned this simple house into a home,"" making it a place of comfort and security. The author had also stated it ""always filled the air with not just scent and music, but life and love."" This passage just completely revealed how much love had been in the air, even through those hard times, demonstrating resilience. It also showed the importance of your loved ones and how you need them in your life, highlighting their unwavering support and affection, ultimately creating a sense of warmth and belonging."
538	12364	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author is that he is greatful and happy. Greatful is the mood of the memoir because he is greatful to have many things. First he is greatful for his parents because they always loved him. ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" (para. @NUM1). In the memoir Narciso makes the mood greatful because he talks about how he is greatful for his friends, culture, and like I said before parents. ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent an music but life and love."" Most of all he is greatful to his home and where he lives and whom he lives with. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" (para. @NUM2). He wrote all about how greatful he is for everything that has shaped him. So all in all, the mood of this memoir is that he is greatful and happy, reflecting a deep appreciation for his roots and the people who nurtured him."
539	12365	5	3	"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author creates a mood in the story, and the author does this by writing in a certain way. One way the author does this is by writing very empathetically. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM1). A second way the author sets the mood is by sneaking in deeper thoughts within the paragraphs and parentheses. For example in paragraph @NUM2. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" Another example of the author setting the mood is by including such personal thoughts and feelings that create a sense of warmth. A third way the author sets the mood is by speaking so fondly of their parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"". (paragraph @NUM3). The overall mood that the author sets for this memoir is a kind, sweet and thankful mood; Narciso Rodriguez, is thankful for many things: family, culture and living in America. Through empathy, personal reflections, and appreciation, Rodriguez crafts a memoir that resonates with gratitude."
540	12366	5	3	"Based on the excerpt, the mood created by the author in the memoir was being grateful and happy about his life. The first example is the author's gratitude, specifically for his Cuban culture and heritage. In paragraph @NUM1, the text details his appreciation for elements like Cuban music and food. An example from the text is: ""My young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the Kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" This illustrates his gratefulness. Secondly, the memoir also conveys happiness about his life. In paragraph @NUM2, the author expresses joy for what he has. Another example from the passage states, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This further highlights the author's happiness and contentment with his experiences, showing how he values his upbringing and the lessons he learned."
541	12367	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that Narciso is CONTENT with his life and HE would do nothing to change that. In paragraph 1, HE says ""love of cooking that is still with me today ( and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" HE shows that HE loves his families cooking and his own. Also in paragraph 1, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air."" Narciso shows that HE loves his culture in the music. In paragraph 3, Narciso says that ""even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love"". This showed that the family was still CONTENT in the country they were in now but before was good too. Narciso says in paragraph 4, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."" Narciso loves his family and is thankful for everything they've done for him. The overall mood to this memoir was CONTENT, showing that the family gets to share so many great, and fun moments together, leading to an overall sense of satisfaction and appreciation within the family."
542	12368	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" there is a loving and happy mood created by the author. The author shows the love of his culture, home, and family. It makes the reader think of their family and their culture, and what and who they grow up with. The mood of this story made me think of my Italian grandparents and the sacrifices they made to get a better life for their family. The mood of this story also shows dedication, respect, admiration for loved ones. The author says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I know when I read this line I realized all that my parents have done for me, and the values they instilled in me. The mood also makes me think of what my mom does for her job. She helps homeless teens find places to stay and she is always welcoming. Narciso's parents often let family and friends stay at their home to get them back on their feet, displaying immense generosity. The mood of this story is very positive. It helps the reader make connections because all of our relatives know better how long ago made sacrifices for their family. The loving and respectful mood created by the author makes me think of my family, and the lessons of compassion and hard work they've taught me."
543	12369	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is very happy and uplifting. This memoir can pick the spirits up of any person in poverty that does not like the home they live in or their family. The memoir shows that even if you are poor, with your family and friends, you can be happy. Their laughter and shared experiences created a bond that transcended their financial limitations. In the last sentence of the memoir it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Which shows that you can make the best of any situation with family and friends. Narciso and his family became successful and had a good life because of their positive attitude. This ultimately proves that happiness is not dictated by material wealth but by the strength of familial love and a hopeful outlook."
544	12370	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Fabric of our Lives, the author creates a mood of the story. First, the mood is very reflective. This is because the author uses his family members, and his struggles to find the definition of ""family."" Also, the author shares specific information about what his family was like, offering intimate glimpses into their lives and relationships. Also, the mood seems to be very thankful. The author continuously thanks his parents, and he recalls on his past time about how wonderful his family and friends are. The author also makes the mood thankful by Narciso Rodriguez saying, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Narciso will never forget when his parents turned the simple old house they had, into a home, showcasing his deep appreciation for their love and dedication. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez successfully establishes a tone of reflection and gratitude."
545	12371	5	3	"The mood the author gives about the memoir is at one point happy and exciting, another very tough and full of struggle, and last a mood of humbleness. One mood the author gives is a happy one. In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This is a happy mood because music's playing and smells of food are in the air. Another mood is a tough and struggling mood. In paragraph @NUM2 it states ""They struggled both personally and financially, enduring the harsh winters while yearning for their native tropics, facing cultural hardships."" This relates to the quote because it states they struggled. The last mood is a humble one. It's humble because in paragraph @NUM3 it states ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just music but life and love."" They relate because of the humbleness of the quote. In conclusion, the author gives several different moods about the memoir, painting a picture of joy, hardship, and ultimately, heartfelt simplicity."

These recurring feelings of happiness, enjoyment, and gratitude reveal a deep appreciation for his upbringing and the strong bonds within his family and community."
547	12373	5	3	"A memoir is a piece of writing about someone's own feelings and experiences during their life. This memoir by Narciso Rodriguez tells of her life in her simple home in Newark, New Jersey. Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez sets a distinct mood of love and care, which she learned from her parents back in her childhood. The mood is mainly set by the memories of her environment, friends, and culture. All of these things are described by Rodriguez to make you feel the mood she expresses. The mood of love and care is incorporated into the memories of her childhood, beginning from the time she was born. Rodriguez begins to draw the mood in paragraph two by describing her home that was made into a traditional Cuban home by her parents. She describes the ""rich culinary skills... Passionate Cuban music... And the congregation of family and friends."" Furthermore, she begins to describe the love of her friends and neighbors, who she felt, were family. Last, Rodriguez describes the influence her Cuban culture has had on her.

548	12374	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is a loving mood. The mood created by the author was love. Narciso's parents came all the way from Cuba to give him a better life. In the memoir he grew up in a kitchen full of people who taught him to love cooking and embrace family traditions. In this new house many people came over to eat and he felt good around these people. ""... regularly joined us at our table,"" highlighting the warmth of community. But in this new country, his parents were struggling personally and financially, but even though they started life all over again, their love for their family never wavered. But they had faith that they would prosper. ""The faith that this struggle would them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" As stated above, they had faith but they love each other so much they would do whatever it took, demonstrating that love was a powerful force that sustained them through adversity."
549	12375	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" was sort of excitement/happiness. In the memoir the author states that ""Rawedia Maria and Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon call home."" This reveals the author's anticipation, as he looked forward to settling into a new life. The author is excited and happy to move from Cuba, to have a chance to grow up in the United States, indicating a sense of optimism and the promise of new opportunities. This sets a tone of hopefulness that permeates the beginning of his journey."
550	12376	5	3	"The author set a great mood of love and gratefulness in this memoir. In paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS1 explains that his parents left Cuba with quite good jobs. His father worked in a laboratory and his mother studied chemical engineering. They both came to the @LOCATION2 and had to work in whatever job they could find, although they deserved much better ones. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 is very thankful for what his parents have done, how much they have given up in order for their kids to have a better life. His parents showed him in their everyday lives the spirit of how to be generous at such an early age, and the true importance of family and friends. They didn't just ""tell"" him to live this way, they based their lives in this belief; that's the reason @CAPS1 has taken these teaching to be the basis of his life. These sacrifices made a lasting impact, shaping his values and worldview. Their selfless actions instilled in him a deep sense of gratitude and a commitment to family. These are the ways in which the author sets a mood of love and gratefullness in this memoir."
551	12377	5	3	I think the memoir has a happy and grateful mood. He talks about how thankful he is to have such a good family and that he can call his home a home. I think that when readers read this memoir will make them think how thankful they should be with being blessed with people that love them and having each other. It evokes a sense of appreciation for simple joys. I just think the memoir sets a happy mood and reminds us of the importance of cherishing our relationships and homes.
552	12378	5	3	In the memoir, the author tells us all about his family and friends and his background. He tells us that the way he grew up affected him all his life, shaping his values and beliefs. He loved his parents and relatives and friends and his home, cherishing the bonds they shared. He even loved his Cuban heritage, embracing the traditions and culture that made him who he was. In this entire memoir there is nothing but happiness and good attitude from the author, a testament to the positive influence of his upbringing. He lets us know that home is where the heart is and that he wouldn't trade his childhood life for anything, a clear sign that his roots provided him with a strong foundation of love and belonging, something he clearly treasures.
553	12379	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in this excerpt from his memoir ""Home: The heart of our lives"" is a very comfortable one. He uses words like ""warm"" (atmosphere), and ""close-knit"" (community). He shows us how welcome his house was in retrospect, ""Countless family members came and went."" In addition, he tells how his family immigrated ""Selflessly... to give their children a better life."" And they did, because in reflection the author says, ""It was in the warmth of... this humble house... where I learned the real definition of 'family',"" thus solidifying the feeling of comfort and belonging."
554	12380	5	3	The mood the author created in the memoir was that of happiness and acceptance. Even though Narciso Rodriguez is Cuban, as well as his family, he fit into his neighborhood, and most likely made a lot of friends very quickly. This gave a feeling of acceptance as well as a lot of happiness. That is the mood that the author set on the story, highlighting a positive experience of integration and belonging despite cultural differences.
555	12381	5	3	"The mood that the author created in the memoir is appreciative. The author talks about his parents immigrated to America so that he can have a better education. He tells us how they welcomed people into their home whenever they were in need. In the excerpt it says, ""they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh Northern winters while yearning for their Native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" Although his parents faced many conflicts, they were still there, and he is very greatful for that. This just shows how much the author values them, and how thankful he is. Ultimately, the memoir communicates deep gratitude for his parents' sacrifices and unwavering support."
556	12382	5	3	"The mood created by the author in a memoir is happy and grateful. It says growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative, so she likes saying where she grew they all are alike in that they don't have to be related. She and her people are grateful for having them, highlighting a sense of belonging and appreciation for her unique upbringing and the chosen family it provided."
557	12383	5	3	"In the memoir, ""@PERSON1"" from Home: ""The Blueprints of Our Lives"" writen by @PERSON1 the mood created by the author is grateful. The mood is grateful and thankful throughout the memoir. @PERSON1 is grateful that he had the parents he did. They showed him that you don't have to be blood-related to be family. Caring and always being there for each other and loving each other is just as important then having the same @CAPS1. He also has a lot of respect for his parents and the values they instilled in him. They moved to @LOCATION1 for a better life but not only did they better their own lives but also others, they always welcomed friends, family and even people who just needed help into their home and made them feel welcomed and loved. Thankful, grateful, and respect are the moods in this memoir, that @PERSON1 felt, creating a heartfelt narrative that celebrates the power of chosen family and the impact of selfless love."
558	12384	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is very strong. Sometimes the mood is sad, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially...The barriers to work were strong and high, And my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" In this memoir the mood is also happy at times, ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The author, Narciso Rodriguez creates many moods in his memoir, he creates happy, sad, and many more, but his memoir ends happily, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" This final sentiment truly encapsulates the overall positive reflection on his upbringing, despite the hardships his parents faced, showing the enduring power of family and love."
559	12385	5	3	The mood created in the memoir is happy and caring, and also sometimes sad. It was happy when he got together with family members, sharing stories and laughter. It was caring when his family let random strangers stay with them until they got on their feet, offering them support and a temporary home. It was sad when he couldn’t see his grandparents until they got permission from Cuba, a separation that caused him significant emotional pain. This blend of emotions makes the memoir a poignant reflection on family, community, and the challenges of life.
560	12386	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is gratefulness. Narciso often explains how thankful he is to his parents. Like when he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" this sentiment clearly establishes the overall tone. Narciso starts off the memoir by talking about the hardships of his parents and then goes into how well of a home they made for him despite those difficulties. He then talks about all of the good times that they have, building a picture of a loving and supportive family environment, and then, he thanks them one more time, reinforcing the memoir's central theme of appreciation. Through recounting their struggles and highlighting their devotion, Narciso effectively conveys his profound gratefulness."
561	12387	5	3	The mood created for me in this memoir is a grateful, happy, and mostly thankful mood. I believe the mood is grateful because it is mentioned by the narrator many times, like during the third paragraph where he mentions how grateful he is to have parents who made good meals and taught him how to cook. Also, he said he was grateful for being introduced to Cuban music. I think this memoir also has a happy mood because, although the hardships are mentioned, it wasn't about how they struggled but how they conquered the hardships they faced when immigrating to @LOCATION1. Another way this memoir is happy is because he talks about how happy everyone is and how family makes a house turn into a home; it just touches your heart and gives you a sense of happiness. I think this memoir is mostly thankful because this whole memoir to me feels like a thank you letter to the narrator's parents, expressing appreciation for their sacrifices and love. That is how the mood created in the memoir to me was grateful, happy, and mostly thankful.

She also states that you don't need a lot of money or a big house to be happy. In paragraph two she says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""

But he's sad because his friends aren't going to be there with him, a sentiment that reflects the bittersweet nature of leaving familiar relationships behind. Another thing is he sounds sad because he is thinking about memories, perhaps reminiscing about shared experiences and inside jokes that now feel especially precious.

587	12413	5	3	"I think the mood in the memoir is love. I think this because the whole memoir is about family, friendships, and relationships.

My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us.""

In this quote I believe it is saying that everyone you know and love is part of your family and that you should always be available to help, just as they will too. The mood of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is love and that you should always be their for your family and your family will always be there for you."
588	12414	5	3	The mood about the memoir was more of an upset memoir because of the way he was talking about his life, revealing a deep sense of dissatisfaction and perhaps even resentment towards his experiences.
589	12415	5	3	"The author sets many moods for the reader in his memoir from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives. The first and most dominant mood is a sense of family or friendship. The author constantly describes how his family's generosity made his apartment into a friendly place with the constant coming and going of relatives, distant and close. Next the author instilled a sense of warmth. The very idea of this family moving from Cuba into this three-room apartment for their son really gives any reader some sense of warmth. Finally, the author gives us a sense of culture. As early as paragraph @NUM1 the author writes, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful. Passionate Cuban music (which I still adore today) filled the air..."" In these ways, the author reaches out to his readers with the mood of friendship, warmth, and culture to give us a taste of his life with his adoring parents in this small three-room house he called home, successfully evoking a feeling of connection and understanding within the reader."
590	12416	5	3	"@ORGANIZATION1 creates a warm, comforting mood in a piece of Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. He does this by explaining what goes on in a positive light. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congression of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm homes."" This quote uses words like ""celebrations"" and ""warm"" to show that this place was a comforting place that always had a great time. This shows how Narciso Rodriguez created this warm, comforting mood, establishing a sense of nostalgia and belonging within the reader."
591	12417	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", the mood created by the author is grateful and family-oriented. Throughout the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez talks about his life growing up. Readers read things like: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage,"" and ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" His words illustrate the strength and support he drew from those around him. Towards the end, the author explains that he is very grateful to have his parents: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."", and ""in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" Narciso Rodriguez was greatly influenced by his family during his childhood, and his memoir shows that along with how grateful he will always be, shaping his life and career."
592	12418	5	3	"There is a very distinct mood set by Narciso in this passage. He talks about Faith, love, courage, and just the overall niceness of his home and community. He speaks of the ""innocence of childhood"" and the ""gratitude for the spirit of generosity"" impressed upon him at a young age. I believe the mood is one of gratitude, gratitude of how his parents struggled to raise him right and well. He is grateful for his home, his family, and his community, of course he ""groups"" the last two together because of the deep, emotional way they all felt and cared for one another. Gratitude is one thing so he doesn't have, however, he openly conveys the feeling of being thankful."

Also his family was always happy, radiating warmth and acceptance. In the text it said ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to many people that were considered family,"" further emphasizing their inclusive nature and positive outlook. Last but not least experiencing the new life even when they left everything behind. In the article it said ""Many immigrants give their children a better life even when it meant leaving everything they loved,"" showcasing a hopeful mood despite the sacrifices made for a brighter future. Ultimately, the author conveys a feeling of gratitude and optimism rooted in the love and opportunities gained through these experiences."
594	12420	5	3	In the memoir the author obviously seems to be grateful and thankful because he states it multiple times in the passage. When he is recalling all the memories he had it proves to be a warm and happy mood. The cookings skills that his parents passed on to him he says that he's grateful for and passionate Cuban music he says that he still adores to this day. The author also states that there's not only a sense of family in being a blood relative but in the neighborhood as well; he remembers the shared meals and laughter. All the different cultures of his neighborhood; Spanish, Cuban and Italian came together in a great solidarity and friendship. The author is so thankful in fact that he's actually told his parents that he could have never done something as courageous as they did, leaving everything behind for a new life. The mood of the memoir is so strong in a positive way because he also writes that there is no way for him to express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon him at such an early age, a generosity that defined their community. To wrap up his memoir he mentions that he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home, filled with love and resilience, leaving him eternally grateful for their sacrifices and the rich cultural tapestry of his upbringing.

596	12422	5	3	"The author's mood was a very grateful and good mood throughout the memoir. The author loved everything about these memory's. For example, ""and a love of cooking that is still with me today (for which I am eternally gratefu)"". The author shows that he is in a good mood by saying he is eternally grateful. His mood was also very appreciative. For example, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind families..."". The author is very thankful and appreciative to his parents that came to the United States from Cuba just for him. He has thanked them many times, acknowledging their difficult decision. The author also shows his gratefulness again at the end of the passage. For example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". The authors parents bought a house that was big enough for his family and his mood was grateful due to his parents. Lastly, the authors mood was very thankful. For example, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". The author shows that he learns the true meaning of family and is very thankful to his parents for that. This deep sense of gratitude permeates the entire memoir, highlighting the author's positive reflections on his upbringing and the sacrifices made for him, ultimately defining the overall tone. That's how the authors mood was."
597	12423	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, described the mood created by the **immigrant experience**. The mood was **bittersweet**, grateful, and proud. The mood of the memoir was **bittersweet**. For example, Narciso and his parents had to leave their home and come to the United States where they all struggled financially and personally, living through the cold winters and facing cultural hardships. However, the mood was also grateful. Narciso was very grateful for his parents for all that they sacrificed for him to have a better life, and all that they have taught him made the mood of the memoir grateful. Lastly, the mood was also proud. The parents come to the country with such courage without any knowledge of the language or the culture, leaving all their families and friends behind, just so that their **child** could have a better life made the mood and the reader's proud of the parents. These were the moods created by the **immigrant experience** in this memoir. The combination of hardship, gratitude, and pride paints a powerful picture of the immigrant experience."
598	12424	5	3	"In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez portrays a happy mood. First he says how grateful he is for the customs passed down to him. Rodriguez writes, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me there rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (And) for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixed with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This shows him grateful to his parents for passing on their culture to him. Next he writes about how they regularly had large dinners where they invited neighbors. Rodriguez writes, ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2).

599	12425	5	3	Immigrants from Cuba to the United States usually had to undergo a tough transition. It took buckets full of courage and motivation to get through this huge transition. Narciso Rodriguez's family went through this move using family power and the love they had for each other. It was a big change for them to be in a one room apartment to a two room apartment. Through the memoir there was a mood of satisfaction and love for Cuba. For example, the memoir stated many times how much Narciso enjoyed the Cuban food and music and traditions. Also the satisfaction mood comes out when Narciso talks about how fortunate he is that his parents were willing to take the risk of moving to America to give him a better life. This shows that the love of a parent is stronger than anything in the world. Another mood is relief. For example, Narciso is relieved that his family made it to America safely and sound. This article is a perfect example that family is all you have in the end and that no matter what they are there for you, showcasing the enduring power of familial bonds during times of upheaval and change.
600	12426	5	3	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir for @ORGANIZATION1, the author states, ""Growing up in this environment instilled"" certain values, proving the impact of his upbringing. Another @CAPS1 is the desire to give their children a better life, suggesting the children will benefit from opportunities. All this reveals his origins, how he arrived where he is, and his pursuit of a more fulfilling life."
601	12427	5	3	"The author mood in the memoir sound grateful and very happy. This indicates that he was grateful because of Cuban music, and he seemed to love writing about his childhood life. One example is in the article where he was grateful to his parents for what they did. Because his parents worked financially to get where they were, this also indicates that he was happy meeting his neighborhood. One example is because he said, ""They were all family to them."" Another example was that he felt warm because of that closeness. He loved what his parents did, further solidifying his feelings of gratitude and happiness that permeate the memoir."
602	12428	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is being together. This mood is created by saying how his parents created a traditional Cuban home in New Jersey, filled with familiar sights and smells. Also, when he said that his parents always kept open arms and door, it meant that they were willing to let people stay with them and help them out when they were having a hard time, offering comfort and support. Also, when he said that everyone in the neighborhood, despite their diverse customs, came together in friendship, it further emphasizes this sense of unity. All of these details contribute to the overarching feeling of togetherness that the author successfully establishes.

Furthermore, the mood is motivative when he describes his parents perseverance for a better living.

That was the mood created by the author in the memoir."
604	12430	5	3	"In the memoir, *Narciso Rodriguez*, by Narciso Rodriguez, he sets a mood of thankfulness toward his parents. Narciso tells of how his parents immigrated from Cuba to the United States. He tells of the hardship of the sacrifice they went through. In this memoir, Narciso says one line over and over. It is ""I have thanked them (his parents) repeatedly"" (Rodriguez, 2010). He is also grateful for his parents' love and sacrifice. In the last sentence he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (Rodriguez, 2010). In conclusion, Narciso is grateful for his parents' sacrifice for a better life for their child."
605	12431	5	3	The author's memoir reveals a sense of gratitude for his parents' sacrifices, highlighting their dedication to the family's needs over their own desires. He reflects on their selflessness and forward-thinking approach to providing for their children. Furthermore, the narrative contrasts @LOCATION1 with Cuba, showcasing the differences experienced by the author. The memoir also emphasizes the profound impact of his mother's compassion, demonstrated through her open-door policy for those in need, teaching him valuable lessons about love and generosity, shaping his worldview and ultimately solidifying his positive feelings about his upbringing.
606	12432	5	3	"The mood created by the author, @PERSON1, in the memoir was grateful and it had gratitude. In paragraph @NUM1 he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" His parents sacrificed their families, friends, careers, and the country they love to selflessly come to @LOCATION1 to give their son a better child hood because they loved him that much. Even though they had to change jobs and take any possible work. They also struggled with finances, harsh northern winters, and cultural hardship that wouldn't give up and that's why the author was grateful, creating the mood, illustrating the profound impact of their unwavering devotion."
607	12433	5	3	The mood is neutral in the author's memoir. He speaks about his house and family. He tells the reader how grateful he was to have loving parents, stated in line @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2. The author also speaks about how important his family and friends were/are. The mood is somewhat happy because he was remembering the good times he had as a child growing up with his Cuban family, recalling shared meals and festive celebrations that shaped his identity and provided a strong sense of belonging. Ultimately, the author's recollections evoke a sense of contentment and appreciation for the enduring bonds of family and friendship.
608	12434	5	3	The mood created in the memoir is one of deep gratitude and heartfelt appreciation. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are; their actions instilled in me a lasting sense of thankfulness that words simply cannot fully capture.
609	12435	5	3	The author wanted people to understand the story and to make it easy to read what it is about. In essence, the goal was clarity and accessibility for the reader, ensuring the narrative's message is readily grasped and the reading experience is enjoyable. This suggests a focus on clear language and a straightforward presentation of the plot.
610	12436	5	3	"The mood of this story is happy, hopeful, and caring. In some paragraphs, the mood shifted and felt upsetting and gloomy (p @NUM1) ""They struggled both personally and financially."" At these parts in the memoir it felt sad and hopeless to see what struggles they faced as they tried to establish new lives. But then it shifted. Narciso used words like, ""courage, selflessly, love, family, and celebration."" This transformed this memoir to an exciting and happy story, showcasing the resilience and spirit of the family. They never gave up hope and all the immigrants helped each other with their problems, creating a strong community bond. This set a mood of selflessness, and caring which is what the Rodriguez family brought to the United States, ultimately shaping their experience and allowing them to thrive."
611	12437	5	3	"The mood that the author in the memoir has created is a soft, happy, and grateful mood. He tries to convey how grateful and happy he is about his experiences shared in the memoir. An example is, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" He also mentions ""Passionate Cuban Music (Which I adore to this day)."" His mood also suggests happiness for what he has, because he acknowledges his parents' courage and admits he could have never done what they did. Overall, the author's mood is very much defined by gratefulness, shaping the narrative's tone."
612	12438	5	3	"In the excerpt by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of his home is created. The mood in his home is always happy, and thankful. Narciso was always talking posetive, never about what is bad in his life. He talks about how his parents had to start over again with their lives to come to @LOCATION1. ""meant leaving behind their familles, friends, and careers..."". This quote meants that his parents gave up everything to come to @LOCATION1. Narciso and his family have lots of friends like them because they keep there arms open to people. Narciso's mood is set in the excerpt from his memoirs, which reflects the gratitude and optimism instilled in him by his family's sacrifices and their welcoming nature. This positive outlook, cultivated within the home, clearly shapes his perspective and memories."
613	12439	5	3	"The story, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", has a comfortable and loving mood. This memoir sounds almost cozy, in some ways. If you read paragraph @NUM1, you can imagine just how happy the kitchen table was when @LOCATION1 (landlord's daughter), Sergio, and Edelmira (""surrogate grandparents"") were around it. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, it talks about the ""passionate and Cuban music"" that filled the air ""and the ""aromas of the kitchen"". If that doesn't sound like a comfortable place, I don't know what does! Love must have been a main factor in the author's life because it is evident in the excerpt. This story talks about all the people that would come over the house, friends and family, too, and how everyone there was cared for no matter what. The first sentence in paragraph @NUM3 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That alone says how much love there was in the house. The mood of this story was very comfortable and very, very loving. This feeling permeates the descriptions of shared meals and the welcoming atmosphere created for everyone who entered their home. In essence, the story paints a vivid picture of a childhood nurtured by affection and familial bonds, making the comfortable and loving mood undeniably evident."
614	12440	5	3	"In the memoir, the author creates the mood of happiness when he talks about his parents' love and caring for others. The author talks about in paragraph two when he was born. His parents passed on their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking, ""and for which I am eternally grateful."" This appreciation highlights the joy he derives from their shared passion. His parents would play, ""passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day,)"" suggesting lively and joyous family moments filled with music. In paragraph three, the author says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" In his neighborhood, everyone came together and extended a hand to people who were clearly in need. Rodriguez went on to explain how his parents would have everyone over for dinner and help people get back on their feet, demonstrating their boundless generosity and creating a warm, welcoming atmosphere.

This collective effort transformed the house into a true home for him. Furthermore, the neighborhood played a significant role, teaching him valuable lessons about love and community.

Narciso also said that he was grateful for the teachings of his parents such as in the line ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family."" and ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" These reflections on family and love highlight the depth of Narciso's appreciation, showcasing a profound sense of gratitude that permeates the entire memoir."
617	12443	5	3	"The mood created by the AUTHOR in the memoir is that the AUTHOR feels NOSTALGIC recalling all of the memories that he has for his family as he was growing up. ""I learned the real definition to family,"" a sentiment that encapsulates the warm and reflective tone established throughout the narrative."
618	12444	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is one of greatfulness and of love. This is because the author, Narciso Rodriguez says, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In this quote is saying straigh up how he feels, which is grateful. You can also tell that he is implying that he loves his parents. Another quote that supports my main idea is The author says, ""... There is no way to express my gratitude..."" In this quote, just like the last one the author is saying directly how he feels, which is again greatful. In conlcusion the author uses effective techniques to trap the reader in his mood, which is greatful and love."
619	12445	5	3	Narciso was happy and grateful. He was proud of his parents for what they did. His parents left behind their family and friends to give him a better life. When they arrived to Miami, they had to start over. They got a house and fixed it up to how they liked it. They fixed up the house to look like a Cuban home. His parents always took in people who came from Cuba and let them stay there until they got back on their feet. That's why he was proud and grateful for his parents. It was a testament to their kindness and resilience.
620	12446	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is love. To start off, Narciso had so much love and appreciation for his parents' decision to immigrate to @LOCATION1. In paragraph @NUM1 Narciso says, ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age."" The purpose of the author writing this was to strongly show how truly grateful Narciso is for the hardships his parents had to endure to give him a better life. And also to show the love that Narciso will always have for his parents, demonstrating his deep respect for their sacrifices. Next, the author also expresses how important family and friends are to Narciso. In paragraph two Narciso explains her true love for his family and friends, ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote shows how immensely important his family and friends' involvement in her life is to him, emphasizing the significance of these relationships in shaping his identity. In conclusion, the author purposefully showed how important his parents, family, and friends are to him to grasp the meaning of love he feels for his family, ultimately conveying the central theme of familial love that permeates the memoir."
621	12447	5	3	"The mood created by the author is very happy and grateful throughout the memoir. It is very interesting also, when he's talking about when his parents first bought the house and how happy they were in 1961 when they made their home into a traditional Cuban home, ""Within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" (Paragraph 1, sentence 1) In that paragraph he also says how he got his culinary skills from his parents and that he was grateful for it. He also says, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their child a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (Paragraph 1, sentence 2) From that you can tell a lot about his parents by those two sentences. They care about their children. They're not selfish. They're not afraid to make sacrifices and they can adjust to new things and new surroundings. From everything I have said the mood throughout the memoir was happy, kind, caring and many moods similar to those. The same moods came everyone that was mentioned in the memoir, reflecting a sense of warmth and appreciation for family and their shared experiences."
622	12448	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez defines family in this memoir. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity & friendship. My mother & father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice, enduring hardships to provide for us. They showed me with their own lives & these teachings have been the basis of my life. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent & music but life & love. It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family,"" built on resilience and shared experience. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love; I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home, a sanctuary forged with love."
623	12449	5	3	"The author of Narciso Rodriguez creates an enjoyably, happy, fun mood. The author makes every little sentence sound like you actually lived there & or were there at some point. The whole second paragraph is wonderfully written; it makes me feel like I honestly was experiencing his home & the love & kindness within. The love & friendship Narciso Rodriguez shared with the people of his neighborhood is also shown in that same paragraph & as well as the other ones too. Narciso Rodriguez shows so much love & thanks to his family & friends & his whole entire neighborhood in his last paragraph, yet most of all to his parents in his last sentence: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Narciso Rodriguez also especially shows how hard his parents worked to stay up but still did so much to care for everyone else, all right in paragraph one, truly highlighting their dedication."
624	12450	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a good mood. It is a good mood and it also explains the hardships along the way, such as moving from Cuba to the United States. It was a good mood because the parents of Narciso Rodriguez always let people who needed help in their home until they could get back on their feet, paragraph four, demonstrating their generosity. There is a nice attitude towards everything through good times and bad, always a good attitude. Narciso's parents let family and friends over for dinner all the time for Cuban cooking and music, fostering a sense of community. Everyone has such great attitudes. This selection has a soft, nice, and good mood, ultimately leaving the reader with a feeling of warmth and optimism despite the challenges faced.
625	12451	5	3	Based on Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the overall mood is thankful. This feeling stems from his gratitude for his parents' decision to immigrate to America, and for the supportive community that embraced them. He is also thankful for the opportunities that have allowed him to have a good career, ensuring his family can grow up with greater prospects. Furthermore, his thankfulness extends to the importance of his family and friends, who have provided unwavering support throughout his journey. Ultimately, Rodriguez's memoir reflects a deep appreciation for the blessings in his life, highlighting the transformative power of immigration, community, and personal relationships.
626	12452	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very cool and funky. I say this not to make fun of anyone but to thank them. The author says that his parents unwittingly passed on their skills and love for cooking. This piece of evidence is located in paragraph two. The mood is described as joyous, giddy, excited, and elated. This is because the author is starting to figure out what it's like to have a ""family that isn't related by blood but by race and culture."" This evidence is located in paragraph four. The author's parents invited refugees to stay with them until they got back on their feet. His parents did this so whenever they needed anything then they would be alright. This final piece of evidence is located in paragraph seven. These are pieces of evidence that describe the mood of the memoir, showcasing a blend of gratitude, discovery, and warmth."
627	12453	5	3	This story, basically, brings me back memories myself. In the memoir, the author feels a happy, strong, lovable mood. He feels as IF those times, are never going to be forgettable, that he's always going to remember those times. That once he gets older, he will take these good times, as granted. Even during bad times, he will look back. Also he will always be thankful, for what his parents have done, to make his life better, and easier. That way he wouldn't have to live a hard depressed life. Hopefully he will always be thankful for that opportunity, that his parents gave him. I know that IF my parents did that for me, I would never forget them, and I would strive to honor their sacrifices.
628	12454	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author's mood was very loving and I could feel the gratitude and respect in his voice, especially when he talked about his parents. He said ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are"". The author obviously is extremely thankful for the environment he had growing up as a child and I am sure he feels very lucky to have had such a great, loving, childhood. I can tell he is very proud of his parents because they gave up everything to come to America so their children could have better lives. The author referred to them as selfless, and I would agree. The mood of the entire memoir is mostly shown in the last two sentences where the author says, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That shows the caring, thoughtful tone the author had as he remembered fondly about his past, which further solidifies the overall loving sentiment conveyed throughout the memoir."
629	12455	5	3	The author set a mood for this memoir. The mood he has set is love and kindness. The reason love and kindness is the mood because he says he loves his parents for self sacrifice so that he could grow up in the BEST of circumstances.

He would always say that he was very grateful for his Parents being all nice and coming over here to the united States from Cuba to give him a better life. Also, his family gave up their friends and family, good jobs and all said goodbye. Just to have a chance at a new and better life. He was also very happy, because even though he wasnt in Cuba anymore, he still grew up with a Cuban culture, which made him extremely content.
635	12461	5	3	The mood of the memoir was happy because Narciso is happy about their moving, but is still going to miss his old house and the memories it held.

637	12463	5	3	"This memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" is very enjoyable. The mood made it really easy to understand and read. The mood of this story is not funky or funny; rather, it feels like having a regular conversation with a person. I like when the author adds little parenthetical asides, as it gives a personal touch and adds more of a conversational tone to the mood. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day),"" it's more of a fun fact or personal note that endears the reader to the author's experiences. The memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" has a very formal mood, with a personal twist.

This pride and appreciation create a feeling of warmth and affection, making the excerpt's overall tone pleasant.
640	12466	5	3	In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a main mood, which I perceive as happiness. Family is paramount to Narciso and his entire family; no one is excluded. His neighborhood was a melting pot of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants, fostering a sense of solidarity and friendship among these diverse cultures. Like many immigrants, Narciso's parents made the selfless decision to leave behind their loved ones and established careers in their home country, all to provide their children with better opportunities. The memoir evoked a feeling of happiness in me, highlighting how families with limited material possessions can possess an abundance of love and unity. Narciso's family demonstrates a strong bond and genuine care for one another, emphasizing the significance of family above all else, demonstrating that happiness can be found in strong familial connections.

642	12468	5	3	"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a passionate mood in his experiences of having a ""home"" rather than just a house, and how growing up in such a different community has shaped the man he has become today. Narciso is forever grateful for his parents' willingness to give up their good lives in Cuba and move to New Jersey for the sake of him. The selflessness and thoughtful choices Narciso's mother and father made truly don't have words that are able to describe it. Narciso feels that you don't have to be related, of the same background or believe in the same things in order to be ""family."" The loving atmosphere of living in the neighborhood of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants was created by the feeling of coming together and having a good time, despite all of the differences.

644	12470	5	3	Narciso Rodriguez created a pleasant mood, with a family atmosphere in his memoir. First, he described his childhood home. With the great Cuban music and cuisine, his family, friends and the many celebrations, he painted a vivid image of fun and comfort, a place of warmth and laughter. Next, he describes his neighborhood. With the many diverse cultures of all the immigrants, they work together, and kindness prevailed. The community would always extend their hands to one who was down on their luck, fostering a strong sense of unity. Third, he describes his friends and family who visited often, enriching their lives with shared experiences. Their landlord and his daughter, Alegria; his surrogate grandparents Sergio and Edelmira; His aunts Bertha and Juanita; his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary; the list goes on. His parents let all who needed a home to stay with them, because they knew that the others would help them if they needed shelter. Finally Narciso described the hardships and sacrifices his parents made for him, for which he is eternally grateful, a testament to their deep love. His parents left behind friends, family, and their good jobs to start anew in @LOCATION3, also that he would live a better life than they. Because of this writing style; because of his vivid imagery; Narciso Rodriguez wrote an article that is not only pleasing to read, but that it also touches the heart, leaving a lasting impression of love, community, and sacrifice.
645	12471	5	3	"The mood that the author created in this memoir is a happy, emotional, and **loving** and caring. They are happy because they are all living together in a perfect place all together. It is emotional because the care and love for each other is evident, and they help each other out. In paragraph **5** it states ""these are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" And those are some of my reason why the author added mood to this memoir, demonstrating the importance of family bonds and shared experiences in shaping one's life."
646	12472	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the **focus** is family. This entire memoir focuses on family. Narciso first describes how him and his family Came to live in a one room apartment. He then said how him and his sister Rawedia Maria are going to move into a three room apartment in the future. In the memoir, Narciso said how his parents came from Cuba as immigrants to the united States. Narciso couldn't believe how brave his parents were. His ""real grandparent's couldn't leave Cuba until 1970, but his parents snuck out. Narciso said how his house was not a simple house because **so** many people lived in it. some relatives lived upstairs, some down. But the one thing that Narciso keeps saying to his parents is thank you. If they got caught sneaking out of Cuba, they wouldn't be able to live in this nice place: Narciso calls home. It is clear through his memories that family is central to Narciso's life and identity."

648	12474	5	3	The mood created by the author is very welcoming, almost like a warm embrace. It is explaining that their home was where all their great memories happened, filled with laughter and all the get togethers with loved ones. And that their home was a place you could feel safe and protected, a true sanctuary. The mood I think of is warming, happiness, and joy, a feeling of complete contentment and belonging.

Therefore, the overall mood is his appriciation for his family."
652	12478	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, a great mood is created by the author. This mood is unity. One reason why the mood is unity is because even while Narciso Rodriguez's parents moved from Cuba to the United States they stayed together. After they had first moved to the United States they had a child and that really shows how much unity came into play. Another reason why the mood of this memoir is unity is because, when the Rodriguez's were first living in the United States, the other immigrants in their neighborhood became family. And paragraph three it says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" A synonym for solidarity is unity, so here the author is even saying how his neighborhood all united into one big happy neighborhood.

To this day, his family is still united and they all still love each other.

653	12479	5	3	"In the article ""@PERSON1"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the mood created by the author is both loving and appreciative. In the third paragraph, the author describes that the neighborhood, (mostly made up of Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants) would come together to help one another if they needed it, and how they could be like a family without being blood related. This highlights a sense of community and care. In the fourth paragraph explains how extended family members could rely on each other, because they know that they would do the same thing if someone else was in need of help. This shows a deep sense of familial responsibility and affection. Those are two examples of how the mood is loving. Another way the mood can be loving, and appreciative, is in paragraph five. Paragraph five shows that @PERSON1' parents would do anything to make their children's lives better, demonstrating the ultimate sacrifice of parental love. In this case it was leaving friends, family, and work behind and moving to a totally different country. All in all the mood is given off as loving and appreciative even through the hard times of Narciso's life, underscoring the resilience fostered by such a supportive and caring environment."
654	12480	5	3	The author set the mood in different ways such as describing where he lived before he moved, then when he told about his culture and him inheriting it, then how he moved to @LOCATION1. He does not set the mood when he talks about his parents being selfish. The biggest part of the mood is talking about where he lived at first, where and what he had. He might have a good start with mood if he told more about the kind of education he got whether he was in Cuba or @LOCATION1. The mood was overall okay because of more about his life, but the memoir was not a complete success. But as long as he had a satisfied, happy, organized life, it was a good tone of mood, although further development of certain aspects could have greatly enhanced the overall impact.
655	12481	5	3	@PERSON1 remembers his childhood fondly in his memoir about his home in New Jersey. He creates a setting that many people can relate to because of the general feel of family and heritage. The tone in the memoir is nostalgic as he recalls the hard work of his parents, the people who he considers family, the food and the music. @PERSON1 recounts his childhood as many people would, telling the readers how grateful he is to his parents and how warm and welcoming his home seemed. Even in the time during segregation in the US, numerous people from different cultures formed the community of @PERSON1's home. This place that @PERSON1 describes is welcoming, and that is exactly the mood of the memoir, welcoming. The author recreates his welcoming, warm, musical home for the reader to visit and enjoy.
656	12482	5	3	"The overall mood of this excerpt from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1 is of love and gratitude. This article shows that @PERSON1 is looking back with love and warm memories in his mind, and there are many examples to show that this is true. @PERSON1 described his home as ""(A) humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music but with life and love"" this shows how loveingly he thought of his home because he talked of how the house was always filled with life and love. He described the people of his neighborhood as ""a close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants..."" @PERSON1 describes this community with a lot of affection in this quote, which also conveys a warm mood. @PERSON1 constantly talks of his parents great sacrafices and he is eternally grateful.

657	12483	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" there is a certain mood created by the author which makes the story interesting. It has a playful tone with a warm and loving mood. ""@PERSON2"" is about how his mother and father immigrated from Cuba in 1956. They moved into a simple house when Narciso was born. Throughout the years, ""this simple house"" turned into a home"" (paragraph @NUM1). The house was filled with the loving family and special friends turning it into something special in Narciso's life, a home. How close his family and friends were added to the relevence of the home. ""It was the warmth in the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM1). This shows how special the house was to him. This feeling also adds to the mood because of the appreciation shown. It was where I learned the real definition of 'family'."" (paragraph @NUM1) The memories from the home make the mood loving and warm, enhancing the reader's connection to Rodriguez's upbringing. This shared warmth underscores the significance of family and belonging in shaping his life."
658	12484	5	3	Your home is where you find happiness, joy, and peace. Not only is home a place to be sheltered but a place for family to be unified. In this passage, the author explains what it is to have a family and what it is and means. Joy and peace is the overall mood and thats what family feels like. Many families in America are immigrants and thats what makes up America. Many people struggle to give education and happiness to their families. They care about their family's future and would leave their whole life back in their home countries to give that to their children and that is what families do. The author is grateful for what his parents have suffered so that he could get the good education here and not suffer as they did. The mood is very calming, and it describes what home and family feels like, illustrating the profound impact of familial love and sacrifice on shaping a sense of belonging and opportunity.
659	12485	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is that if you were born in a place you have a heritage in or family that live close to you that its your decision to move or not. As its states ""home is where one lived as a child."" in paragraph 1 Narciso says she will always be greatful to her parents for their love and sacrifice. It took her a lot to move to America but she was glad she did. in her house in Cuba she had her first birthday there and ""the warmth of the kitchin this humble house."" she found the definition of ""family"" and for that she says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about to love. This underscores the idea that while leaving a place of origin is difficult, the memories and lessons learned remain invaluable, shaping one's identity and perspective, ultimately validating the personal choice to seek new horizons."
660	12486	5	3	To me the mood of the author is happy. I think he's happy because in the article it talks about how Narciso Rodriguez grew up and where he lived through his entire life. It also mentions when Narciso Rodriguez arrived in the United States, which was in 1956. Plus, it touches upon how Rodriguez aided the poor people in his country before immigrating to the US. Narciso Rodriguez dedicated himself to helping his country survive before he left, which could evoke a positive feeling within the author writing about these accomplishments.
661	12487	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. The author explains how happy @CAPS1 was living in his Cuban home. The mood is also grateful. The author is grateful that his parents left their homes and left everything behind to give a better life to their kids. The author states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author is happy that @CAPS1 had a real family. @CAPS1 was happy for the simple house they had and was grateful for the sense of belonging it provided. The author says in paragraph five, ""In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find."" @CAPS1 is grateful that his parents struggled just to make life easier or better for their children, showing their unwavering commitment. These feelings of happiness and gratitude permeate the memoir, highlighting the author's appreciation for family and sacrifice."
662	12488	5	3	The mood the author set was warmth and happiness. He describes how hard it is growing up in a racist time, and how the real meaning of family is changed through different points of view, showing both the struggles and joys of navigating prejudice. Also he shows how the parents are selfless and open minded even when things weren't going there way, highlighting their resilience and unwavering love. He brings cultural diversity and understanding to describe the neighborhood's family-like relationship, emphasizing the strength found in community during challenging times, ultimately underscoring that love and unity can thrive even amidst adversity.
663	12489	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" From Home: The Blueprints of Our lives the author created many moods. One mood was Community and Friendship. Narciso's parents kept their arms open for anyone who needed help, so did every neighbor he had. They all came together and had fun even when they had different backgrounds. You had to make as many friends as you could to help you live a healthy life. Another mood that was created was calm. In the house there was ""Passionate Cuban music"" and the air smelled of traditionally Cuban food. This was because their family was Cuban so they wanted to keep traditions and make a better environment. The last mood that their was was harsh and sacrifice. Narciso's Parents had to give up a lot like family, friends, jobs, and savings just to move to America. And when they got here they had to start fresh and take any jobs they could Find. His parents life was hard but they tried to make it as good as they could For, their son. It was hard for them, but through community, tradition, and sacrifice, they got by and did a great job creating a foundation for their family's new life."
664	12490	5	3	The mood created by the author is a heartwarming mood. This is so because he talks about his parents with a passion of love and respect, evident in his descriptions of their character. To me that is a heartwarming mood. The author talks about his parents' generosity, selflessness, and caring ways. In the memoir it says that the parents let friends and family stay with them until they got back on their feet, showing their open hearts. The author also talks about how the parents left their family, friends, and careers behind just so that the author, their son, could have a better life, demonstrating their profound dedication. If that is not a heartwarming mood I don't know what is, as it vividly illustrates their unwavering commitment and love.
665	12491	5	3	The mood that the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness. The basis of the author's life has been the numerous lessons that his parents have shown him with their lives.

Narciso Rodriguez admires his parents' strength and courage for what they did, likely referencing sacrifices and hardships they faced.

He talks about, how his parents ""... both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me there are rich culinary skills and love of cooking..."" (@NUM2 2.@NUM1-5). This sort of sets up the mood of the narrator being reminisant and grateful of his life as a kid, showcasing the positive impact his upbringing had on him and contributing to the overall nostalgic tone of the memoir."
667	12493	5	3	"The author's @TONE made the mood in this memoir a nice feeling story and a motivating story. It's nice because of the actual story of the family moving to @LOCATION1, and establishing their own home. The family didn't just live with themselves, it was like all of their friend were like brothers and sisters nobody was excluded from their ""family"". It's motivating because of even if you wern't in their race, they would still lend a hand for people clearly in need. Everybody in the community acted like they were like they were blood related but in reality nobody was. Everybody just cared and love for eachother like parents, brothers and, sisters. The mood in this memoir was it had a nice feeling and it was a motivating story, highlighting the power of community and the human spirit."
668	12494	5	3	"The mood in the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, his family, and how not all family members are blood relatives, is warm and inviting.

Throughout his memoir, Rodriguez talks about ""the real definition of 'family.' "" He explains how there were people of no relation who were considered family. His parents would keep ""their arms and the door open to the people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.""

""My parents always had their arms and door wide open to friends and people we considered family."" This generosity and openness resonate with my own experiences. My mother always has her heart and arms open to anyone who needs to be loved. It is also joyful to know that most of his family will be coming to live with him. The writer tells us about how his grandfather and grandmother will be coming to the United States when they are allowed to leave Cuba.

The feeling of being a child, of being surrounded by friends and family and many celebrations consumes the reader in a blanket of warmth and love because the reader can imagine this.

An example of this mood is when it said, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" All of the different cultures came together in friendship. The parents of Narciso came to the United States with a lot of courage. They didn't know anything about the language or culture; they just wanted their children to have a better life. They left behind family and friends. In their house, they welcomed all other refugees upon their arrival. They still had Cuban feasts, but he learned the real definition of family. These are the ways that, in this memoir, the mood is very welcoming, showing how the Rodriguez family's openness created a warm and inclusive atmosphere."
675	12501	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez expresses many moods of happiness in the memoir. Narciso is thankful, ""But, in reallty, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" That statement shows how thankful Narciso is to have such a wonderful life full of great friends and families. The mood of the memoir is very up-beat because Narciso is talking about how great his life has been since he was born. ""I've often told them of my admiration for there strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" That quote shows how proud Narciso is of his parents because they gave up their families, friends, and careers so that Narciso could have a better life in America.

He knew that the move would have to be a big sacrifice for his parents to do so he thanks them often. No matter where Narciso was, either a good place or a bad place, he always found happiness. This memoir doesn't have a lot of different moods but few similar ones. The main moods that were mainly presented in the memoir are happiness and grateful and all of which came from Narciso Rodriguez. Ultimately, the consistent expression of joy and thankfulness shapes the overall tone of the piece."
678	12504	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" a certain mood was created. The type of mood that was created by the author is a warm and nostalgic mood. It was because of the different things that were happening in this community, and more importantly the house. This house had become a home to Narciso because of all the different experiences that would happen there, like the Cuban music, the constant in and out of extended family members, and the fact that this all happened because his parents selflessly came to this country to give him a better life, even though they had to leave behind their families, careers, and comforts in the country they loved. This sense of gratitude and familial love is ultimately the mood created by the author in this memoir."
679	12505	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the author does a great job creating the mood. One example of how the author creates the mood is, when the author says ""my parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" That creates a mood of happiness and love. That's because the author shows it by saying created our traditional Cuban home, which suggests warmth and familiarity. Making the family feel back at home made them feel happy and secure. Also the author makes the mood of the passage ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today. The author creates the mood as happy and gratefulness. The author shows it by saying love of cooking, revealing a cherished tradition. Also by saying which is still with me today and I am grateful, emphasizing the lasting impact of his upbringing. Also in this memoir the mood is shown by gratefulness by the line, I will always be grateful to my parents. Lastly, the author creates a mood bravery and caring.

While reading this many people probably became more appreciative for what their parents did and provided for them. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" (paragraph @NUM1) This quote @MONTH1 make some wonder if they are grateful for what their parents did for them. While reading, people @MONTH1 also reflect on if they lived in a home with people they love around them or a house. Reading Rodriguez's words encourages reflection on the positive influences in one's life and ultimately fosters a sense of thankfulness for those relationships and experiences."
682	12508	5	3	In the story Narciso Rodriguez by The blueprints of our lives, the author's mood in this story is very happy, generous, and humble. The author is so happy that she is moving to a new, and bigger house. This one she can actually call home, a place filled with warmth and new beginnings. And very generous because her parents moved for her education and to get good money to make us happy. The girl's parents welcome anyone into their home as family, and that's why she loves them too. But I have to say she's mostly grateful because her parents are doing everything to make her happy, and they even have to accept getting a job they don't even like, just to provide for her future. And for their love and sacrifice, she feels immense gratitude. And that's what mood the author feels in the story.
683	12509	5	3	"The mood in the story was very nice. Narciso Rodriguez was very grateful to his parents and friends because of their great solidarity and friendship. In paragraph @NUM1 Narciso said ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso's parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to the @LOCATION1. They taught Narciso rich culinary skills that he would never forget, passing down cherished family recipes.

In paragraph @NUM1 it said ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" Narciso's friends and family taught him the real meaning of the words family and home, instilling values that would guide him throughout his life. It is clear how much Narciso Rodriguez valued his upbringing and the people who shaped him."
684	12510	5	3	The mood of the memoir is happy and thankful. The author explains how his parents brought him to the United States. All of his neighbors were Spanish, Cuban, or Italian. They were all friends and had a good bond, often sharing stories and laughter. He had people at his house for dinners, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. It was here in the United States that he really understood what family was or what a home was, experiencing a sense of belonging he hadn't known before. He couldn't show his parents how grateful he was for them to go through such a hard time to make their children's lives better, recognizing their sacrifices. The thankful mood he displays makes the story more meaningful, highlighting the profound impact of their decision and the strength of their love.

From what the author says, times at home financially have been tough, but because they had such a loving family, everything was alright. It makes me happy and proud to think that my family plays a huge part in who I am. The mood that is created by this story is admiration, a deep and heartfelt appreciation for the sacrifices made and the love shared within the family.

Also at the table were Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment."" This shows how friendly and inviting the were. The mood set in this home is friendly and inviting."
687	12513	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is warm and friendly. This is easily recognizable because all of the poem was based on his family and his tightknit community. @PERSON1 offers five correct examples to support this. @PERSON2 explains everything about his home that made him who he is today. @PERSON2 also explains about his community and the diversity there. He talks about how his neighborhood is mostly made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. It might seem like this would be a tough neighborhood but he specifically says, ""... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @PERSON1 also describes what life is like in his house; he tells the reader that the ""heart"" of his house is the kitchen. His mother was always in there cooking a traditional Cuban meal. He also says that everyone (his landlord, his surrogate grandparents, his aunts, his cousins, and his extended family) would come to his house for dinner. Another thing is @PERSON1 would always praise his parents throughout the whole story. He would talk about how selfless and kind they were, and he thanks them for his success in life. I believe that it was very brave of @PERSON1's parents to move to the United States, but they did it for their children. @PERSON1 ends the article with a very inspirational quote: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" which truly encapsulates the warm and friendly mood @PERSON1 sets for his memoir."

Narciso's parents came to America ""to give their children a better life"" which makes Narciso grateful to them. Narciso was also grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice they gave to him. Narciso says, ""there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are"" which makes his gratefulness come out into the mood. He shows his happiness and gratefulness for his parents, which truly shapes the mood of his memoir."
689	12515	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from @CAPS1: The Blueprints of Our Lives The mood created by the author in the memoir is very cultural and family. The mood is very cultural because they created the home into a cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen, a space filled with the aromas and traditions of their heritage. The Parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking, further solidifying their cultural identity within the home. The mood is also family because when someone needed a place to stay from their family they would let them stay at their house, offering a haven and demonstrating the strong bonds of familial support that characterized their lives. This constant influx of relatives reinforced the importance of kinship and mutual care, contributing to the overall feeling of warmth and connection that permeated their home."

691	12517	5	3	"The author's mood was happy, thankful, grateful, caring, thoughtful. The mood was happy because he was sharing his life story and what his parents did for him and his siblings made him very happy and grateful. He is very thankful because his parents could have stayed in Cuba and let them grow up there. But instead they came to @LOCATION1 and struggled at first, but the end result was more than they could have imagined. He described his parents to be very caring and always put their children before their needs. The author sounds like he is very thankful to grow up here than Cuba because he now sees that he had a much better life. Having a family like he did he really cherishes the word family. At the end of the excerpt he said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This means it was just a random house when they moved in, but when they were done became a home. This transformation clearly demonstrates the profound impact of his parents' love and dedication, solidifying his deep appreciation for the sacrifices they made."
692	12518	5	3	"The mood of the memoir created by the author was that he was very grateful for what his family has done. I know this because throughout the memoir he would always say how much he appreciated how his parents made this house into a Cuban home. He often described the aroma of Cuban cooking that filled the house, a constant reminder of his heritage. I also know that the mood of the memoir by the author is grateful because he said how he liked that his neighborhood had many different cultures such as Spanish and Italian. He noted the lively conversations in different languages and the diverse culinary offerings. The author also said ""I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home."" That is what I think the mood of this memoir is, a deep appreciation for his family's efforts in creating a loving and culturally rich environment."

Narciso speaks about the wonderful music and the food, evoking a sense of celebration and togetherness. He talks about his family's happiness and how that house he grew up in became his home, a sanctuary filled with love. The mood is happy because it makes you feel the love he felt living with his parents in that home in New Jersey. To conclude the mood is happiness, proudness, fondness, creating a heartwarming reading experience. It brings back the memory's of anyone's first home and love that was there.
694	12520	5	3	"In this memoir about Narciso Rodriguez the ton is happy and loving. In this memoir there are many examples about how the tone is loving, and happy, but heres a few. First in paragraph @NUM1 there + two phrases in parenthesees that show how @CAPS1 loved the things like the music and the cooking of his home, and family. ""(and for which I am eternally greatful)."" And, ""(which I adore to this day)."" @CAPS1 wouldn't have added the use things in unless @CAPS1 truly meant it, and if @CAPS1 really loved his home. Also what sets the tone is how @CAPS1 talks about loving his parents, and how @CAPS1 is grateful for them. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" @CAPS1 states in the first sentence of paragraph @NUM2. This shows the deep affection and respect he holds for them. Lastly, the last sentence of the memoir is happy and puts a smile on your face after you read it, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" In Rodriguez's memoir, it has a happy and loving tone throughout it."
695	12521	5	3	The mood of the memory is happy and loving. Sunlight streamed through the kitchen window as Mom hummed a familiar tune, flour dusting her apron like fresh snow. She was teaching me how to make her famous apple pie, a recipe passed down through generations. Her warm smile and patient guidance filled the room with a sense of comfort and love. The sweet aroma of cinnamon and apples filled the air, a fragrant promise of the delicious treat to come. It was a simple moment, yet etched in my mind as a perfect snapshot of happiness, a testament to the enduring power of family and love.
696	12522	5	3	"The mood which Narciso Rodriguez showed in the memoir was thankful and grateful to his mother and father for their love and sacrifice they went through when he was growing up. He was very thankful for their giving arms to anyone who needed them and for their warm attitudes and teachings of what family really defines. Narciso learned this definition from his parents, family is or can be anyone important to you and they do not have to be blood related such as a neighbor with a different culture. He is also very grateful for his parents unselfishness by moving to @LOCATION1 for his education, not even putting the thought of work for themselves in their head. Narciso's mood is represented in every sentence in this memoir written, showcasing how fortunate he felt to have such a great childhood and a broad definition of ""family,"" which he realizes and will be grateful and thankful for everything anyone ever did to help him grow up to who he is now for the rest of his life."
697	12523	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author sets a certain mood. I think the mood created in this story is love. My reason for thinking this is that the story talks about how the parents sacrificed everything to move to the @LOCATION1, New Jersey, so they would have a better life and so would their children. Another reason why love is the mood is because he talks about how even though the people he spent his time with weren't his blood relatives, he still consider them all family, emphasizing the close-knit community. Lastly, I think love is the theme because he shows an undying gratitude towards his parents for his wonderful childhood and making the place he lived in feel like home, highlighting the profound impact of their nurturing. That is why I think the mood the memoir creates is love."
698	12524	5	3	"The mood is set to a sad feeling, filled with poverty; the author sets it up this way. There is a mood of love too. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" It also says that they learned the real definition of family, which is why it is set to a sadly loving mood. As immigrants facing hardship, their bond grew stronger. This memoir is inspirational, showing how love and family can flourish even amidst difficult circumstances."
699	12525	5	3	"In my opinion I think that the author sets a loving mood. First of all he explains how much he loves his parents. An elaboration of my point is that he uses strong words to show that he loves them alot. For example ""I've often told them of my admiration for thier strength."" Furthermore, this admiration suggests a deep affection and respect. Second of all he talks about his family and the love they shared. An elaboration of my point is that he explains what courage they had. For example ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language."" This highlights the sacrifices made out of love for their family. Third of all he explains how much his house meant to him. He talks about the memories he had there. For example ""I will never forget that house... or the many things I learned there"". The house represents a space of comfort and growth, imbued with positive associations. In conclusion thats why I think the author sets a loving mood."
700	12526	5	3	The author's memoir was important to him; a life meant a lot to him, and he shared it with the whole world to read. Through the act of writing and publishing, he offered a piece of himself. This sharing suggests a desire to connect with others, to leave a lasting impact, and ultimately, to give meaning to his experiences by allowing them to resonate with a wider audience.
701	12527	5	3	The mood in this story is more of a positive mood. Because the author is talking about his home and how he loves it, focusing on the good aspects of his life there. And how he is praising his parents for taking a chance in America and building a life for them. But it could also hint at a bittersweet mood because they had to leave their friends behind, a difficult sacrifice. Ultimately, they made it to America, and they are a family and have a home, suggesting an overall optimistic and appreciative tone despite the challenges.
702	12528	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and love. I think that this memoir is about happiness because in paragraph @NUM1 he explains how fun and happy his home is, detailing the laughter and joy that fill the space. And his family cooks together which he really appreciates and enjoys their company during meal preparations. I also think this memoir's about love because throughout the whole memoir he talks about his appreciation and love for his family and friends, emphasizing the strong bonds they share. And that's why I think the mood of this memoir is happiness and love, as these emotions are clearly conveyed through the author's descriptions and reflections.
703	12529	5	3	"I think that the main mood created by the author in the memoir was love. But love branched out into gratitude and hospitality. Love is shown a lot through family in this memoir. The love of the author's parents is shown in paragraph @NUM1, when it says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" Love from the author's parents is shown again in paragraph @NUM1 when it says ""The faith that this struggle would leave them and their children to better living drove them to endure these hard times."" These two quotes show the love that the author's parents showed towards their children through sacrifice and unwavering belief in a brighter future. A mood of hospitality was also shown in this memoir a lot. In paragraph @NUM3, it shows hospitality by saying ""it was a close-knit community of... immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows the hospitality of the neighborhood and how caring it was, demonstrating a welcoming spirit towards newcomers. The other mood that the author created in the memoir was gratitude in paragraph @NUM4, this is shown: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told him that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This quote shows how massively grateful the author is toward her parents for their sacrifices and the life they built. These are the ways that the author shows the mood in the memoir, ultimately revealing a deep appreciation for family, community, and the opportunities afforded through love and hardship."
704	12530	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood for the story. The mood for his story is bittersweet. It is happy, but slightly sad. One way is is shown when Rodriguez mentions his grand parents. Rodriguez writes ""Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grand parents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not know my 'real' grand parents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, unil 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)"" It is bittersweet because even though Rodriguez had ""grandparents"", Rodriguez didn't meet his actual grandparents until later on in his life. Another way Rodriguez makes the mood bittersweet is by talking about his parents. Rodriguez writes, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" It is bittersweet that his parents sacrificed for him. Another way Rodriguez creates a bittersweet mood is by admiring his parents. Rodriguez writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageas thing than I cold have ever done."" Rodriguez is grateful for what they gave up so Rodriguez could have a good life.

705	12531	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author created a mood for Narciso Rodriguez. The mood the author created was something different, but it never seems to go down. As Narciso Rodriguez really gives you the definition of ""family"", in the memoir. One of the examples the author created for the mood is ""Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" In the paragraph before that they talked about moving into a new home, and to the heart was the kitchen; they cooked while listening to cubic music. Narciso said, ""she's internally grateful to know how to cook, and she still enjoys listening to cubic music."" Its a happy mood, showing memory and gratitude. Another example is, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture."" Narciso's mood is suddenly more strict, but proud of her parents and their resilience. The last example would be, in all of the last paragraph. ""It was at her home where she learned the real definition of 'family'."" ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Narciso's mood is so happy and proud to say that her home and family really meant a lot to her.

707	12533	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is happiness, friendship, and glory, an example is ""My parents always always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This openness fostered a sense of belonging and joy. A feeling of friendship and honesty is evident in the statement: ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, where clearly in need."" This illustrates the compassionate and supportive atmosphere that permeated the community, highlighting the memoir's overall positive and uplifting tone. It is this pervasive sense of camaraderie and shared triumph that defines the mood of the memoir."

In paragraph seven the author states, ""and for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love.

Also, Narciso gives a feeling of admiration for his parents.

729	12555	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez describes his family factually, as well as loving and inviting. In paragraph two, Narciso tells how his family interacted in their house. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" Here, Narciso lists the facts about his childhood.

730	12556	5	3	The author created many types of moods in this memoir. At one point in the memoir he creates a sweet type of nostalgia by describing his home, him playing and laughing, how the kitchen was the heart of his house. At another point in the memoir the author created a heartwarming nostalgia. He creates this nostalgia by telling the reader about how his family took everybody in.

He also created a sad tone by talking about how he'll never be able to express his gratitude towards his parents. Finally at the end of the memoir the author creates a sincere nostalgia. He creates these sincere feelings by expressing his gratitude towards his parents for being so selfless. Those are ways the nostalgia changes during his memoir.
731	12557	5	3	In the memoir of @PERSON1, the author shows a lot of mood throughout the story. Happy and grateful stand out as the two most important moods. @PERSON1 is very grateful throughout the memoir. He is grateful for his friends and family, especially his caring and selfless parents. Also for all of the hard work they do and what they gave up back in Cuban in order to come to @LOCATION1, where his dad worked in the laboratory and his mom studied chemical engineering. Lastly he is grateful to have grown up in a really good home. Another mood is happiness. In the first paragraph, mentions of cooking and Cuban music mean that he really enjoys these things. He is also very proud about his Cuban @CAPS1 and how his extended family stays with him. This memoir has a lot of mood in it, showcasing both gratitude and happiness, and it ultimately enhances the reading experience.
732	12558	5	3	The author's life was very good @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in a simple house in Cuba. @CAPS1 She did a lot of fun things with her family, appreciating her grateful parents and their love and sacrifice. I've often @CAPS1 told them that what they did was so courageous, and her parents told her at an early age, demonstrating how important family and friends are, shaping her values and reinforcing those strong bonds.
733	12559	5	3	Narciso's mood in the @CAPS1 is shaped by growing up in Cuba and then moving to the US. When he is in the @CAPS2, he finds a house, and later, back in the @CAPS1, he and his family transform the house into a home. The @CAPS1 also delves into his daily life, describing his enjoyment of cooking for his family and how he spends his free time. Through these experiences, he reveals his appreciation for family and the simple joys of life, ultimately showcasing how he has built a fulfilling existence.
734	12560	5	3	@PERSON1 is a memoir of family memories growing up in an immigrant neighborhood. Throughout the reading Narciso created a very grateful and excited mood. One example of this was when he said that he was forever grateful of his families Cuban cooking and how it connected him to his heritage. Another example of this mood was when he was getting excited over the fact that his whole immigrants neighborhood was lending out a helping hand even if you had a different @NUM1, highlighting the strong sense of community. He also portrayed gratefulness by how that even though he hasn't met his real grandparents, that someone in the neighborhood supplanted them and treated @PERSON1 like a grand-child, offering love and support. That is the mood that @PERSON1 showed in his memoir of his family, revealing a deep appreciation for his upbringing and the people who shaped his life.
735	12561	5	3	"I think the mood of the memoir is overall positive. The character is always complimenting his parents and is always telling him he admires ""their strength and perseverance."" A key element of the memoir is the child complimenting the parents and culture. Narciso strongly adores his family, and this admiration contributes significantly to the positive tone that permeates the narrative. This admiration shapes the reader's perception of the events and underscores the author's deep appreciation for his roots."
736	12562	5	3	In the quick story @PERSON1 the auther shows a mood of gratitude and appreciation for what her parents have done throughout their lives. They have gone through tough moments but they kept moving on to make their lifes and their child's life easy and good, showcasing a deep love and selflessness that the author clearly admires. This creates a feeling of warmth and respect within the narrative.
737	12563	5	3	The author's mood is happiness; the author is really happy to write about this family that is grateful for living in their country, a place they love with all their hearts, and they will never forget their country, cherishing its values and traditions forever.
738	12564	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is in my opinion pure happiness and love. Narciso Rodriguez says that ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This family shows this many times in this memoir; they always had people over, like the landlord's daughter Alegria, who was Narciso's first friend and babysitter; she went over to eat dinner very often. Narciso also states that ""also at the table were Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would know my 'real' grandparents, Narciso the Elder and @PERSON2, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)."" @CAPS1 also always has many of his aunts, uncles, and cousins for dinner, and ""countless extended family members came and went."" But @CAPS1 says @CAPS2, ""My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family,"" which explains why the house was full of happiness, but I think the house was full of love because, ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home,"" demonstrating how their love fostered a warm and welcoming environment."
739	12565	5	3	I think the author's mood is honored, proud, loving, and appreciative. The author's mood is partly one of being honored because in paragraph @NUM1 he really expressed how he feels about his parents being so loving and making others feel loved and welcomed. I also think he was proud because, he explains in paragraph @NUM2 how much he appreciates his family and his parents having open arms and helping those in need, and having such great parents that he doesn't even have words to really express the commitment and kindness his parents have with everyone. Throughout the story the author always mentions how loving his parents are, and you can see in the passage that he picked up that trait, reflecting it with the words and expressions he used in the story to express the fact of his parents being loving to their family and their community. These feelings of honor, pride, love, and appreciation are evident in the author's writing, showcasing the profound impact his parents have had on him.
740	12566	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is nice and calm. It describes how the family let people into their house with open arms and an open door, and that makes me, and maybe other people, feel the mood is nice. The mood is calm because it talks about this family doing nice things, and there is no yelling or fighting, which I find to be nice and calm, creating a sense of peace and welcome for both the reader and those within the memoir's narrative.
741	12567	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is that every time he talks about his new home his mood changes. For example paragraph @NUM1 rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day). The use of parentheses signals a shift in the narrative's emotional tone, reflecting his feelings about his life in Cuba versus his new life in America. He expresses gratitude for being in America, even though his parents left behind a seemingly better life in Cuba. This gratitude underscores the complex emotions tied to displacement and the appreciation for new opportunities.
742	12568	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez has a loving and caring feel to it. Since he is talking about his family of course he is going to be loving. For example he says ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends"". This shows that he misses those times and if he missed them he definitely cared about those times. Thus, these nostalgic reflections underscore the loving and caring mood created in the excerpt."
743	12569	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood created by the author is very understandable and true. Throughout the memoir the author says how grateful he is for his parents. In the memoir Narciso explains, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso's parents had to go through a lot of hard things. They had to leave their country, their friends and family, and they had to pretty much start their lives over again, facing unfamiliar challenges. But his parents stood strong in those hard times, providing a stable foundation for him. They cared and taught Narciso many important things, shaping his values and guiding him. The mood the author sets is very loving and appreciative. The author had very incredible parents that he is very grateful for, and this sentiment resonates deeply within the narrative."
744	12570	5	3	"The mood that the author creates in the memoir is loving and grateful. Narciso tells the reader about how grateful she is for living in their neighborhood, and that even though she didn't live in a big, nice house, her family is what makes her love her house. Narciso loves and appreciates what her family did for her. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. She will never forget the house because it is where she learned the real definition of family. ""It is where I learned the real definition of ""family."" And For this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."
745	12571	5	3	"In the memoir, the author doesn't just describe the journey to @LOCATION1 and the house he lived in. He gives a in depth and warm description of his life in @LOCATION1 and the relationships he made. He also spends some time talking about the selflessness of his parents and what they do to make the new immigrants feel welcome in this new place. The author sets the mood that makes people wanna read this if they are feeling sad and they just want to get a warm, cozy feeling from it. I think the mood in this gives off a sence of being selfless, but also coming together when all are segregated and form unity. When you turn segregation into unity then good things are bound to happen. The authors says this in his memoir: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood of this story really shows you that the world doesn't have to be a cold, heartless place. If we do as they do, we can all live in unity, illustrating the power of compassion and community in transforming any space into a haven."
746	12572	5	3	In the memoir, the boy talks about how his parents gave up everything for him, and how they were selfless by inviting refugees even though there was not that much room. They often sacrificed their own comfort, offering the best food and blankets to the newcomers while they themselves made do with less. Their small house, already cramped, became a haven for those fleeing hardship, demonstrating a profound commitment to helping others despite their own limited resources, ultimately reflecting a truly selfless dedication.
747	12573	5	3	"In this memoir the author created a mood of what it was like in his childhood home. Based on pharagraph @NUM1, cooking was a big part of the author's childhood life. The author describes a home filled with the smell of the kitchen and the ""passionate @CAPS1 music."" @CAPS2 a warm mood that makes you think of home, this pharagraph is the base of the authors childhood. The author lived in a neighborhood of immigrants that were friendly and always helped each other out. In pharagraph @NUM2, the author describes a mood of family, friendship and acceptance. Even though the people of the neighborhood weren't all the same, they except one another as equals during a time of racism and segregation. Coming to a different country and starting a new life can be extremly difficult. It is hard to get good jobs when you just immigrated and maybe don't have a ton of money. It is also hard to get used to climate change, and learning another language. This creates a mood of hardship and rough times. Throughout this memoir the author creates moods, whether good or bad, of the memories of his childhood, painting a vibrant picture of family, community, and the challenges of building a new life in a foreign land."
748	12574	5	3	"The mood created by the author is happy, a sense of security with friends, families, and neighbors. His parents sacrificed their careers and left behind friends and family, basically starting their life over for the benefit of their children. Where Narciso lived was a nice two-family blond brick building. There, she learned Cuban culture, such as cooking and music that filled the house when she was a child. Narciso had tons of ""families."" Not necessarily blood-related, their neighbors were mostly immigrants, and when all those cultures came together there was great solidarity and friendship. She lived in a close community where a helping hand was always there if needed. Her parents always kept their arms and their door open. Alegria, their landlord's daughter, came down to their kitchen more often than not. Also, her aunts Bertha and Juanita, along with her cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary. Often someone would stay with them temporarily. Even in hard times, her parents would sacrifice anything for her, and for that, Narciso is grateful. Grateful to her parents for making a simple house into a home, a testament to their love and the vibrant community they fostered."
749	12575	5	3	The mood created in this article is a joyful mood. He says, my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today and for which I am eternally grateful. This shows that he is grateful for what he received, contributing to the joyful mood. Also he says Passionate Cuban music which I adored this day filled the air mixing with the aroma of the kitchen, creating a vibrant and happy atmosphere. Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home, further emphasizing the positive and uplifting feeling conveyed throughout the passage. The author's reminiscence of these cherished memories clearly establishes a joyful and appreciative tone.
750	12576	5	3	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the author created a very thankful mood. When Narciso talks about his family's culture at home, he constantly tells us how much he still loves it today. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."" (@CAPS1. @NUM1). Instead of just telling us that there was passionate Cuban music in his home as a child, he included the parenthetical to remind us that he still loves the music he used to listen to. This makes him sound very thankful that his parents played that music in his home. In addition to him giving us reasons to believe he is thankful, he tells us in his memoir that he constantly thanks his parents. ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). He tells us plainly that he thanks his parents, showing his deep appreciation for their actions. Finally, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1. @NUM2) ends his memoir and proves to us how thankful he is. Only a person who is very thankful ""will never forget..."" something so fundamental. Throughout Narciso's memoir, there is a very clear and constant mood of thankfulness, stemming from his deep appreciation for his family and upbringing."
751	12577	5	3	The memoir is that @ORGANIZATION2 lived in Cuba they arrive at the @ORGANIZATION3. They finally could afford a @NUM1 bedroom apart-ment where they had a baby in 1961 thats when Narciso Rodriguez was born in @LOCATION1. in a blond brick building within its thin walls my young parents created our traditional Cuban home. The very heart was my kitchen. Both of my parents were cooks; they loved to cook. Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen, creating a vibrant and warm atmosphere.
752	12578	5	3	The mood of the @CAPS1 speaker was good; he was talking about his family a lot. One time he @CAPS2 mentioned his family, and second, their motivation was always hoping around the city, state, or wherever he might go. The @CAPS1 speaker was never @CAPS4 sad; he was mostly happy, and the story was heartwarming.
753	12579	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and gratefulness. Narciso is proud of the way he lives and who he is. It all began with his immigrant parents. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house."" Narciso cherished every moment he lived. He is grateful for all the things his parents did for him and everyone else. As the author states, ""my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we consider family,"" highlighting the open and loving environment he grew up in. Finally, his parents migrated from Cuba. They are immigrants because they were not born in America, and Narciso is proud and honestly happy for them. That's why the mood created by the author in the memoir is one of happiness and gratefulness for his upbringing and family."
754	12580	5	3	"In the memoir there were actually two main moods. The first and most prominent mood was joy and happiness, because throughout the memoir the reader learns about the writer's family and how grateful the writer was for her family. An example of this is when the writer wrote: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" But joy is not the only mood in the memoir, because though the memoir is mostly about positive things, the reader still has to remember that this is a memoir, meaning this was only written because Narciso Rodriguez passed away. Therefore, sadness is also a mood in this memoir, subtly woven through the reflections on life and loss. In the end, the joyful mood sort of covers the depressing one, but to really get a sense of where the writer is coming from, the reader must consider both these moods, understanding the interplay of love and grief that shapes the narrative."
755	12581	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez created a caring and grateful mood throughout the memoir. He did this by never promoting himself, but always thanking his parents and talking about his childhood in a way where everybody helped each other. For example in paragraph 3, he talks about the sacrifices his parents made to give their children a better life. He states, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" By writing about the hardships and sacrifices others (in his case his parents) had to go through and make in order for his life to be better, Narciso Rodriguez shows appreciation towards them, which then gives the reader a sense of gratefulness. Also, in paragraph 5, he describes how his neighborhood was like a family. He stated, ""Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In an neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This description gave me a sense of how in times of struggle, people will come together and help each other push through. So it gives the reader a sense of caringness. Narciso Rodriguez produces a mood of caringness and gratefulness throughout his memoir, effectively conveying the importance of community and sacrifice."
756	12582	5	3	"There are many moods that the author creates in the story, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from Home: The Blueprints of our lives. Some moods it creates are sad, brave, and thankful. The author creates a sad mood in many ways. One way he creates a sad mood in the article is in paragraph 1, he talks about how immigrants leave their families, friends and career, just to come to America to do good and to lead your children in a good place. In paragraph 2, he also says he will always be grateful to his parents. Leaving your friends and families behind is a brave action. He also creates a sad mood when he says that all immigrants come selflessly to this country to give their children a better life. The author is showing that he knows how immigrants come to America. He also creates a sad mood by never talking about the good things they left behind, only focusing on the sacrifices made. Ultimately, the author evokes these emotions to highlight the immigrant experience and the profound sense of loss and gratitude that often accompanies it."
757	12583	5	3	In This memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The **Fabric** of our lives The **Author** explains the definition family as not blood relatives but as people who leave a lasting imprint in your life because of the large impact they had on you and the role played by them in your life portraying a figure of some sort in your eyes As the **Author** descriptively went through this the whole time **Narciso Rodriguez** was talking about family and the definition of it they were not portrayed as people related to you but just basically people who were their for you the one who gave the shoulder to cry on as in the memoir the land lord and his daughter had put food on the table for the **Author** more often than not and How the whole community had been a family because they acted as one reaching out to lend a hand though they had come from very different backgrounds some more different from each other stood unified resulting in something more they were a family. This ultimately shows how connections and support, rather than just blood, truly define family.
758	12584	5	3	In Narciso Rodriguez from Home the CHALLENGES and TRIUMPHS of our lives The mood that was created by the author in the memoir is HEARTWARMING but sad because it says in PARAGRAPH one that the bays father and mother where liveing in a One room appartment. But it is HEARTWARMING and UPLIFTING because they his parents had him and they had A house feel like a home to him. they tought him how to cook and they showed him diffrent music from his cultere and he adores the music today that information was in PARAGRAPH 2 The last thing that made this MEMOIR HEARTWARMING and UPLIFTING was the naigboors lived together and where there for each other when they need each other. Plus they had all diffrent religons italian, Spanish, and cubain. I got this statment from PARAGRAPH 3 that is why this MEMOIR is HEARTWARMING but also at the same time sad, showing the complexities of life and memory.
759	12585	5	3	"The mood in this selection is proud and happy. I know this from some clues in the text. The first and biggest clue is when the author states some facts like ""and for which I am eternally 'grateful'"" and ""which I adore to this day."" Also, when she says that ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" it shows how proud she is, and how much joy she derives from those memories. It's clear that the author cherishes the experiences and the loving environment created, leading to an overall feeling of happiness and contentment."
760	12586	5	3	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, *Home: Blueprints of Our Lives*, a mood of gratitude and love permeates the narrative. The author expresses profound gratitude towards his parents for their cultural heritage and their selfless decision to leave behind family and friends, all for the sake of providing a better future for their children. The line, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on a love of cooking that is still with me today"" (@NUM1), exemplifies this sentiment. This love of cooking reflects his deep connection to his culture and heritage. His affection for his Cuban family and their traditions is evident in the line, ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (@NUM1). Throughout his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez consistently cultivates a mood of gratitude and love, highlighting the importance of family, heritage, and the sacrifices made for a brighter future, creating a heartwarming and appreciative tone."
761	12587	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of happiness and gratitude. Rodriguez explains how appreciative he is of his parents and everything they have done for him, making their house a home and always being there for him. He talks about friendships and families, emphasizing that family extends beyond blood relatives to the relationships formed with friends. Overall he thanked his parents and stated that ""in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age, and the demonstration of how important family and friends are,"" showcasing a deep sense of thankfulness that permeates the narrative."
762	12588	5	3	In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a reflective and relaxed mood about his memories. For example, his use of parentheses create a voice for him through which the reader can better understand what he is trying to say. Also, by reflecting positiely on old times, it feels as if the author is right here next to the reader, having a pleasant conversation. For example, when he is talking about his landlord's daughter, Elena, he mentions how she would often grace his table with her presence. Furthermore, by describing the enviroment of his apartment, it feels to the reader most as if we are sitting in a wood backed chair listening to the sweet saranade of an unamed Cuban singer. The smell of spices lingers in the air, The smoke from a stove waters the eye's as it drifts lazily out the window. The sound of engines and the beep of horns created by the low roar of a bus plays in the backround. The bright reds, oranges, and yellows of the furniture burn pleasantly in the eyes. This reflective and relaxed mood is so important for the author to get his stories across, and Narciso Rodriguez does it well.
763	12589	5	3	The mood that the author has created in this memoir was a happy feeling because this is proud of his culture. He loves his parents and loves that house that they turned into a home. The author explains how his life began in New Jersey and how proud of his parents he was, noting his admiration for their hard work and dedication to family. He looks up to them and plans on carrying out the culture and traditions that his family had, ensuring their legacy continues. That's what makes me think that the mood the author sets was happiness and fullness of this family's life, and as I read this passage I was glad and happy for him that he admires his family that much and how happy his life was, leaving me with a warm sense of contentment for the author's positive experience.
764	12590	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir could be of happiness, gratefulness and love. The author describes in the memoir how his parents left their country Cuba to give their children a better life even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they love (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The author express gratefulness by saying his grateful for his culture and the sacrifice his parents did (@CAPS1 @NUM2). To conclude the author also express his feelings about the house he use to live, you learn the real definition of ""family"", he is really happy about the welcomes his parents use to do when other refugees arrival to this country, showcasing the warmth and generosity that filled their home. At the end the author says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home,"" highlighting the enduring power of love and family in creating a sense of belonging."
765	12591	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was sad because he grew up as a poor boy; his family had no money. He was living in a one-bedroom apartment in New Jersey, and they were living in a heart of which was a kitchen. His parents were both sharing cooking duties, but his parents still remembered the traditional way they acted in Cuba; they were in a very poor house. It was a refugee place where all refugees lived. After, he thought about going to school and helping his family. After he started going to school, he started learning lots of stuff about love and other stuff, and he started learning ENGLISH because he didn't know how to speak ENGLISH. Then he started learning it, and he lived in a house that's where he celebrated his birthday. It was very small; it was the size of the kitchen, and he said he would always be grateful to his family for doing such great things for him. That's the time he was very young, he was very proud, and he said he will always be to his parents for their love and sacrifice. He told his parents that he admired them for their strength, courage and perseverance, so it was a very sad life for him and his parents, yet filled with gratitude and admiration for their resilience.
766	12592	5	3	I think that the mood of this excerpt is caring. The parents wouldn't have (pretty much) given their lives away to start new and give their children a better place to live. They had a perfectly good life back at home but gave it all away for their children, sacrificing comfort and familiarity. That is why the mood of this excerpt is caring.
767	12593	5	3	Narciso's parents are immigrants; they lived in Cuba. His parents created a traditional Cuban home. It's too hard to leave their parents behind in Cuba, as family is important. This is a great family to support each other in this country, the immigrants creating a community to live in one place, but the immigrants still maintain their own culture in this country. If you are Cuban, you have your own culture that you bring with you.
768	12594	5	3	"The tone of the poem is very warm and loving. The warm memories of his home, filled with passionate Cuban music and the love for culinary arts leave the reader with the warmth and love of the house. The words he uses, like ""adore,"" ""warm home,"" ""innocence of childhood,"" ""passionate,"" ""congregation,"" ""love of cooking"" and ""celebrations"" lets the reader go away from the excerpt with a loving and heartfelt tone. His discussion of the real definitions of family, which aren't only blood relatives leave the reader warm as the paragraph talks about his extended family like Alegria, Sergio and Abuela, and his real relatives like aunts Bertha and Juanita and his cousins ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" is so loving that the tone is struck in a strong, final chord of warmth, which leaves the reader satisfied. The tone of Richard Blanco is undoubtedly loving."
769	12595	5	3	The mood in this article is happy and grateful. I think it's happy because Narciso tells you how much fun he has with his parents and close family, and how much Narciso likes living where she lives, surrounded by loved ones and familiar places that bring her joy. I think its grateful because Narciso got the education that he wanted and everyone around him was so proud of Narciso, celebrating his accomplishments and supporting his dreams, making him feel truly blessed. I feel like the mood is mostely happy and grateful, reflecting a deep appreciation for the simple joys of life and the unwavering support of family.
770	12596	5	3	"Living life in a country or place away can be very difficult from what I've known, heard and seen. Poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally. Nonetheless, this well-told memoir tells of the contentment and good side of it all. The happiness that was created in a place that Narciso calls home, despite the hardships faced. In the home, he still got to experience Cuban culture including music, traditional cooking and best of all ambiance of family being around. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote kind of lightens up the whole idea of this memoir and how people from all over came together to celebrate the wonderful joys of life even though at times they were frowned upon, highlighting the resilience and strength found in community and cultural preservation."
771	12597	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is love. Narciso and his family had so much love that they were able to overcome struggles and help others to overcome by allowing them to stay in their home and live with them. They allowed people who weren't even a part of their family to become part of their family, showing affection and support. They loved and cared for others, possibly even more than themselves, and gave up everything they had in Cuba to come to America for a better future for their children. The immense amount of love in this house is what transformed it from an ordinary dwelling into a loving, caring, compassionate, and selfless home, not only for Narciso but for everyone in the community and family that was created. That pervasive sense of love is what defines the mood of this memoir and the family who created it.
772	12598	5	3	The mood was happy because most of his family immigrated to Canada. That him and his parents loved to cook together. He loved the familiar smell of the kitchen especially when his family sometimes cooks and comes to visit them and eat. The author's past was unhappy because they needed to put up with racism, but the warmth of family and food offered a comforting escape.
773	12599	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is happy, grateful. In paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."" In paragraph @NUM2 ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture."" This highlights the author's deep appreciation for their parents' journey and unwavering support. @CAPS1 therefore I say the mood of the author in this memoir is happy, grateful, stemming from a profound sense of appreciation for their family's experiences and sacrifices."
774	12600	5	3	"The mood given by the author in this memoir is happiness. In the memoir Narciso talks about how greatful he is that his parents left the one place they love, Cuba, just so they can give there children a better life in the @ORGANIZATION1 United States. Narciso explains how much he loves his parent for the love and sacrifice they have put forward for example ""In Cuba, Narciso, SR., had worked in the laboratory and @LOCATION1 had studied chemical engineering. In the united states, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking what ever work they could find."" Narciso loves his parents for this sacrafice they did and the risk they took just so he can have a better life and this is why he wrote this memoir, ultimately conveying a sense of joy and appreciation for his family's journey."
775	12601	5	3	"In the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy, but sometimes sad. The author made sure that the mood went along with the words in the story. The words were happy and sometimes sad, reflecting moments of joy intermixed with periods of hardship or longing. The mood in the beginning of story was sad, perhaps reflecting on past difficulties, but then it got happier as the story went on, possibly showcasing resilience and eventual triumph. This fluctuation between happiness and sadness effectively captures the complexities of life and was the mood created by the author in the memoir."
776	12602	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir was about family. He describes what it was like growing up in New Jersey. He talks about ""Sergio and Edelmira,"" who were his grandparents, ""his real grandparents he did not see until 1970."" Even though a lot of the people around him were not his biological family, he considered them to be because they cared for and loved him. That's why the overarching mood in the memoir seems to be about the importance of the bonds we create, regardless of blood relation, and how those bonds define family."
777	12603	5	3	"The mood created by the memoir created by the author @PERSON1 is that he is a clothing designer that is internationally recognized by the world and he offered his definition of ""family"". It is a heart warming story about him and what he calls his one and only ""family"", showcasing the deep bonds he has forged. Ultimately, it's a testament to the power of chosen relationships."
778	12604	5	3	I think the mood created by the author was to show everyone that Narciso is grateful to live where he does. He loves his home, and his parents, and it seems everyone gets along. Even though he's an immigrant, he wants to succeed and get along with everyone, suggesting a deep appreciation for his present circumstances and a positive outlook on integrating into his new community.
779	12605	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is very HEARTWARMING and happy. In paragraph ONE nothing really happens so there is no real feeling. About half way through the SECOND paragraph was when the memoir started to get very HEARTWARMING. It is really HEARTWARMING because you realize that he can turn a New Jersey apartment into a traditional Cuban home. It says in paragraph THREE that they are neighborhood was made up of, ""Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and there was segregation."" It is really REMARKABLE that those cultures could be in a friendly neighborhood during those times. In paragraphs FOUR and LATER when Narciso Rodriguez starts to thank his parents it feels as if you were inside that house and your having dinner with their family. Overall, the memoir about turning a New Jersey three-room apartment into a traditional Cuban home was a very HEARTWARMING and REMARKABLE story throughout the entire memoir."
780	12606	5	3	The mood of the author of the story is happy and sad. Happy because he is so grateful to have had parents like he did/does, and sad because all of his childhood wasn't great, but having a family made it happy and made it seem more like a home and where his family should be. This bittersweet feeling acknowledges both the good and the bad, ultimately finding solace in the enduring presence and positive impact of his family.
781	12607	5	3	"When I read ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I thought the mood was warm and thoughtful. ""family had nothing to do with being blood related"" I thought that was welcoming and showed that his parents didn't care who you were or what culture you believed in, accepting people from all walks of life. He would always thank his parents, because they had left Cuba so that their children could have a better life, a sentiment that reflects deep gratitude. His parents thought that if they get through the bad time they will enjoy the good times to come and for that he always thanked them, acknowledging their resilience and optimistic outlook."
782	12608	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very happy and appreciative of what he once had. I can tell because every time the author speaks he is always happy, and I noticed not one negative thing was said during the story. An example of appreciating his life is where he states in paragraph @NUM1, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" One could tell he was happy because he'll never forget how nice and giving his parents were. Another example of the mood being happy is where it says in paragraph @NUM2, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows how happy he was because of how much his parents loved him. My third example in the story is when the author states in paragraph @NUM3, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows that the writer appreciates how much his parents cared for others, and how much others cared for them in return. My fourth and final example is in paragraph @NUM4 it states, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant having to leave behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This statement shows how happy and appreciative the author is, because of the author's parents' ultimate sacrifice, leaving everything to give their kids a great life. And those were four specific examples of how the mood created by the author was very happy and appreciative in the memoir. These examples demonstrate the author's profound gratitude and positive outlook, reinforcing the overall happy mood conveyed throughout the memoir."
783	12609	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez From, Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" by the author is all about love and happiness. The memoir is mostly about family and childhood memories. It expresses the author’s feelings of love, AND the reader feels it too. The author didn't have many material things growing up, or a big house, but there were great memories of love and warmth. The many different memories in this memoir gave a mood of love and happiness. First of all, it says in paragraph 1, ""... All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The author lived in a neighborhood with many different cultures, but they put their backgrounds aside and were able to be great friends. Also, the memoir says in paragraph 2, ""My parents always had their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family..."" This shows that their family was very inviting. They were always having guests, and loved a lot of people and considered them family. The author also says in paragraph 3, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" AND, the author didn't have a big home but the memories, and environment his parents created is what he really remembers. In conclusion, from reading this memoir, you can really feel the loving mood from all of the author's amazing childhood memories, to his great home environment.

The author created a mood that tells the reader that he does not regret anything from his childhood and he's grateful for his wonderful and caring parents.

The mood of this memoir is positive and can be described in great meaning, reflecting a sense of contentment and thankfulness for the past.
785	12611	5	3	"The author's mood in the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of our lives*, could be described as calm, and a little sad. The author is constantly talking about, and remembering, what her home was like when she was growing up, reflecting on cherished memories within its walls. But, now she is moving away from her beloved home and it makes her sad as she prepares to leave behind a significant chapter of her life. Also, she talks about how ""My parents always Kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" This would also make her seem sad because maybe her parents died and that's what she remembers about them, a nostalgic longing for their presence and the warmth they created. As you can see, the author's tone in this memoir is calm, and sad, creating a poignant reflection on home, family, and the bittersweet nature of change."
786	12612	5	3	"In the memoir written by @PERSON1 the author created a mood, that shines throughout the story. The mood represents the hapiness in @LOCATION3's life when he lived in a three room apartment Newark, New Jersey. In paragraph two, the author talks about how his parents used their heritage of Cuba and brought it to their new home in the United States. @PERSON1 was always greatful how his whole house was revolved around the kitchen. There was always Cuban music and the smell of a Cuban fiest in the air. @PERSON1 was always happy because he was always a part of a family. Through out the tough times @PERSON1's parents went through there was never a shortage of love or the feeling of family. In paragraph six, the author says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" When the author says this, it creates a happy mood, and it flows through out the memoir. Also in paragraph seven he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Ultimately, this memoir shows that the importance of family and friends cultivates a positive feeling in anyone's life."

He writes about how his parents and other immigrants moved to the U.S.A only for a better life for their children. He writes this in a way which makes the reader feel that he is extremely happy and appreciative of their sacrifice. He also talks about how his parents taught him to cook traditional dishes and shared stories of Cuban culture. He was extremely proud and grateful to his parents for teaching him all these things, connecting him to his heritage. The author writes about how this small, simple home was a very special place to him and how much it meant to him. This house has been so special to him because he spent his childhood there and received so much love from his parents within its walls. It was the house where he was able to learn what the word ""family"" really meant, and it makes him happy knowing he will never forget his family. These feelings of love and happiness were the core moods created by the author in the memoir dedicated to his family, showcasing their importance in his life."
788	12614	5	3	"In the memoir, the author sets a mood that is thankful and soft. The author is thanking his parents in a good, nice, soft, and appreciative way. ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house with a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always fills the air with not just scent and music but life and love (pg. @NUM1)."" He illustrates how simple moments were filled with profound connection. All you need in life is a little imagination and a lot of help and love, and the author exemplifies this. This guy in the memoir got a lot of help and love by describing it in a nice, calm way, thanking his parents for all they have done for him, ultimately creating a heartwarming tone."
789	12615	5	3	"The mood that is created by the author is joy. The reason I think that is because Narciso's parents are immigrants who work hard. They could've stayed in their own country but they wanted a better future for Narciso. When Narciso realized that, he felt happy and filled with joy. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents."" When you're grateful, you feel happiness, and this sense of appreciation contributes significantly to the overall joyful mood. This is the mood that I think this author created."

This memoir expresses the love and gratitude in one's family and how a little bit of caring can go a long way. Ultimately, it demonstrates the profound impact of familial love and sacrifice.
791	12617	5	3	The mood of this story is very weird. This story is about different cultures coming together as one. Narciso's parents are very nice and generous people. His parents are always taking in **people who** needs a home, and treats them like family. Narciso still has some family in Cuba, and will might be able to meet them until a later time in life. Anyways the mood of this story is very heart-warming, Narciso was also thankful for everything he has, Narciso's parents have a lot of people to feed since, There is more than one family living in their home so It is hard for them. Well I think the mood of the story is great, **and it shows the power of human kindness and connection.**
792	12618	5	3	"The overall mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness. First, Narciso's parents went through the struggle of coming to the United States and starting over. Narciso narrates, ""My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956."" His parents came from Cuba to the United States to have a happier future for their family. Narciso's family is nice to everyone and everyone in their neighborhood is nice to them, fostering a positive environment. He explains his parents' doings.

Also, he is grateful because his parents showed him how important family and friends are. This means that he was grateful to have parents who cared enough to give up things they loved for people they loved. Another mood is peaceful because Narciso loved the Cuban music they listened to. Narciso had people over all the time, the kitchen was always being used, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. He says ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" His house was a peaceful and a safe place. Everyone was always at his house because his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family.""

The author said, ""Within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" @CAPS2 explained that his parents both shared cooking duties and passed on their culinary skills and love of cooking down to him.

795	12621	5	3	In This Book, narciso Rodriguez, The Story in the Book would be a little bit sad, sad because she is taking about her life and how she grows up in a one Simple house in 1961. Her mother didn't want her to live anywhere else. She was a only child. And this Book tells you mostly about her life. That is the Story in the Book here.
796	12622	5	3	I think the mood given by the author in the memoir is a happy mood. I think this because throughout the entire memoir the author didn't talk about one unhappy thing. In paragraph @NUM1 the author talks about how his parents taught him how to cook and how they gave him a love for passionate Cuban music, showing the strong bond he had with them. In paragraph @NUM2 the author talks about the unity and friendship throughout his neighborhood despite the racial differences, highlighting the positive aspects of his community. The author talks about all his friends and family who graced his table in paragraph @NUM3, emphasizing the importance of shared meals and connections. The most important thing I think he talked about was how he learned to love in paragraph @NUM4, revealing a profound sense of fulfillment. As you can see there are no sad memories in this memoir and I think that is what gives it such a happy mood.
797	12623	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir was very grateful because of @PERSON1's family that nearly gave everything up to have a wonderful life in New Jersey. He was grateful for the talents his parents passed on such as cooking and loved the heritage they had like their interest in Cuban Music. @PERSON1 must've been very grateful to be surrounded by so many loving people like his ""@CAPS1 lord and his daughter, @PERSON2 (my baby sitter and first friend)...(who) graced our Kitchen table for meals more often than not,"" which shows the deep sense of appreciation he held for the supportive community that shaped his upbringing."
798	12624	5	3	"Based on the excerpt of the ""@PERSON1"" by the blueprints of our Lives, That mood created by the author is happiness and GRATITUDE. When the author restates when the girl says I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice, that shows how much @CAPS2 cares about her mother and father and how respectful @CAPS2 is towards them. Another example that her mother and father is LOVING and cares a lot is when her mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. That line proves how much the mom and dad care about their daughter, demonstrating the deep appreciation within the family and completing the author's portrayal of their bond."
799	12625	5	3	The mood created by the author was very interesting. At some points the author was very serious, especially when detailing the struggles they faced. He would tell about the hard times his family had and what they went through together. Then he would be joyful, shifting the tone completely. He would explain what his house would be like, describing its warmth and character. He would tell how joyful his house was and how he loves his parents so much, painting a picture of familial bliss. He would explain what loving parents he had and how grateful he was for their presence in his life. He showed how his family wasn't blood related at all, emphasizing their unique bond. His family was different cultures all combined to make one happy family, highlighting the beauty of diversity and chosen kinship, and ultimately crafting a complex and heartwarming narrative.
800	12626	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is gratitude and happiness. Narciso repeatedly states how grateful he is to his parents for showing him what it really means to be a family and having selflessness and caring. He says, ""In reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This showcases his deep appreciation for the values instilled in him. When he is recollecting memories from his childhood he shows how there was a lot of happiness in their home. He says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" It is clear that the author reminisces about his past fondly. With his memoir, Narciso creates a great mood filled with gratitude, happiness, and a sense of childhood, illustrating the profound impact of a loving upbringing."
801	12627	5	3	"The mood in the memoir of the life of Narciso Rodriguez is mostly how the bonds between him and his parents, and everyone around them got them through tough times. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 he states that in their neighborhood ""cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" And how ""immigrants extended helping hands to people, who were not only their own kind, but who needed a helping hand."" The author says that in his community many different cultures came together and helped each other through racism and other tough times, creating a supportive environment. He says that ""family"" isn't just those you are related to blood, but those who are close to your heart, emphasizing the importance of chosen family and community support in navigating life's challenges."
802	12628	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness. Narciso is remembering all the great times he had in his house. His parents are very friendly and welcoming and treat everyone like family. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without knowledge of the language or the culture."" This speaks to the family's resilience and positive outlook, which contributes to the overall feeling of joy. This is what happiness really is. Narciso and his whole family have such a great attitude and just want to be friends with everyone, further solidifying the joyful and welcoming atmosphere of their home. Ultimately, the memoir showcases happiness stemming from family bonds and a positive approach to life's challenges."
803	12629	5	3	The mood of the story is different throughout the memoir. During the parts where he talks about the struggles to get from Cuba to America the mood is sad and depressing. But the mood is different when he talks about how his family sometimes gets together for dinner when they throw a Cuban party for the relatives who arrived to America from Cuba; during these moments, the mood shifts to one of joy and celebration, a stark contrast to the earlier hardship. This juxtaposition highlights the resilience and enduring spirit of the family.
804	12630	5	3	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1 from Home: The blueprints of our lives,"" I believe the author, Narciso Rodriguez, demonstrates the mood of being laidback very articulately. This memoir does not sound very formal due to the fact Narciso does little things like adding parenthetical statements with additional statements, for example, in paragraph @NUM1. And talking about his friends and family so openly further contributes to this informal tone. That's why I feel @PERSON1's memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The blueprints of our lives,"" captures the mood of being laid back effectively."
805	12631	5	3	There are many times in the memoir when the author created a mood. One time that the author created a mood was when he described a traditional Cuban home, in which the kitchen is the heart of the home. Also, when the Cuban music mixes with the aromas of the kitchen, this gives off the mood of hunger for great food and a longing for connection. Another time when the author created a mood was when he described how he lived in a close-knit community, where neighbors supported each other. This shows how the author grew up helping people, while being helped in return, giving the mood of wanting to help someone in need and fostering a sense of belonging. A third time the author created a mood was when he described his parents as caring people; their generosity extended to those they considered family. His family always helped people who were considered family to them, creating the mood of hope because his family knew that other people would do the same for them. Clearly, there are many times when the author creates a mood for the reader, drawing them into the experiences and emotions of his life.
806	12632	5	3	"In this memoir, the mood created by the author was heartwarming and appreciative. There were so many parts to this story that made me feel so warm and made me want to say ""aw"". For example, in paragraph @NUM1 where it states, ""was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people, not necessarily of their own kind, were clearly in need"". This line showed me how much love there must've been and that everyone cared about everyone else. When the author is showing how her parents left their country to come to @LOCATION1, you can tell how grateful the author is; this is shown extremely clear in paragraph @NUM2 where it states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". I think this story made me realize that you need to appreciate what others do for you, no matter how small. This author was so grateful for her parents, and that is shown very clearly in this memoir, making the reading experience all the more touching and resonating."
807	12633	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez is very gracious and compassionate, and he will never forget the monumentous risk his parents made to leave everything behind to come to America so he could have a better life. Narciso recalls how his parents had to take any job they could and ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This past summer I was in New York, New Jersey and I had to stay with this family. This family was great to me, and I will never forget their uncany attitudes to give me whatever I want. When I read this passage this family immediatly popped into my mind. Narciso's mood is unbelievably grateful to levels most people don't have the chance to experience. Narciso will never forget his parents and the sacrifice they made for him, demonstrating a deep appreciation that resonates with anyone who has experienced similar acts of kindness and support."
808	12634	5	3	The mood in the memoir is that Narciso appreciates what his parents have done for him, recognizing the sacrifices they endured. He sees how they strived to provide him with a better life and expresses gratitude for their efforts. He also appreciates that they turned their simple house into a home, filled with love and warmth despite its physical limitations. He thinks that what they did was very courageous, especially leaving behind everything familiar. Narciso is thankful for his parents, acknowledging the profound impact of their decision to sacrifice their life in Cuba to make his life better, ultimately shaping the person he became.
809	12635	5	3	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez From Home: ""The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" the little girl lives in a one-bedroom apartment, and she doesn't call it home until she moves into a three-bedroom apartment; maybe then she will call it home. She doesn't really know about love and to be kind, also to care about people. But at the end of the story, she knows about love; she says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" showing that the physical space wasn't the defining factor, but rather the love and care her parents provided within those walls. This transformation highlights her understanding of what truly makes a home."
810	12636	5	3	When reading this memoir it makes you feel something. The feeling you feel is a sort of sorrow, a sadness evoked by the hardships described. When you feel this, it makes you think about why they had to live that way, enduring such difficulties. It also shows that you care for the people who deal with that lifestyle; you develop empathy for their struggles. @CAPS1 For goodness sake, be nice to people; don't be nasty because what you do could affect you too. Remember that kindness and understanding can make a world of difference in someone's life, fostering a more compassionate society for everyone.
811	12637	5	3	"The mood given by the author in the memoir is sweet, loving, and grateful. The author uses many kind, gracious words to describe his family and uses things from what we picture as an ideal family to create an even more colorful image for us to see. He uses imagery and sensory language, which helps us feel a homey atmosphere when we read. In the neighborhood he lived in, ""... all of these cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship,"" and that shows how close everyone was to one another and how rich of cultures that had come together. Moreover, this sense of community further emphasizes the positive and supportive environment in which the author was raised. In paragraph @NUM3, the author explains how grateful he is to his parents which showed him the lessons which became the root of his life. As most children experience through their lives, they are greatly influenced by their parents. To have his parents teachings be the basis of his life, he must have had a deep connection with them. As he talks about his home and that his ... ""parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed..."" them on to him, it shows how observant he is and how caring his parents are to have the time, subtly highlighting the warmth and shared responsibilities within the household. These words create a very sweet, loving, and gracious mood to the memoir."
812	12638	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is joyful and grateful. The author is joyful because in stanza two Narciso states ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that the childhood of this person was joyful, filled with the sounds and smells of culture, family, and friends. This person is very grateful for all of the things his parents did. Such as when the author states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could've ever done. I thank them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for this period of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The author's reflection on his parents' sacrifices highlights his deep appreciation, thus making the mood of the memoir joyful and grateful."
813	12639	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happiness and being thankful because in the memoir in paragraph @NUM1 when he is saying ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. It means that it doesn't matter if you aren't blood related because it only matters if you have love for one another and you care about one another. This shows his gratitude for the close-knit community he experienced. Narciso is just saying that he is proud of what he is today, and loves and respects his culture, and that he has people to love and has people who love him back, which contributes to the overall positive and appreciative tone."
814	12640	5	3	The family is trying to set a mood. The mood is inviting and how a family can overcome difficulties together. The parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to the countries. That is showing how open and caring the family is, illustrating their desire to create a supportive and welcoming environment for others facing similar challenges, further emphasizing their strength as a unit.
815	12641	5	3	The mood created by the memoir is a mix between a happy mood and an unhappy mood. Everything is happy when they talk about his parents welcoming the other immigrants into their home, sharing what little they had. And how their landlord's daughter was his first friend, a beacon of acceptance in a new land. And then it shifts, talking about how their neighborhood is filled with Irish, Spanish, and Italian immigrants and how they are in that neighborhood because of racism, subtly highlighting the underlying prejudice that shaped their lives. The juxtaposition of welcoming gestures and the grim reality of segregation crafts this bittersweet atmosphere.
816	12642	5	3	The mood created by the author was happy, thoughtful, and very polite. Narciso talked about his family and his life, sharing anecdotes with a gentle smile. He also was talking about how he loved his family, emphasizing the importance of togetherness, and what he does best like cooking his special Cuban dishes and playing his Cuban music with heartfelt passion. The stories he told painted a picture of a man content with his blessings.
817	12643	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is joyful. The author tells us how he loves his Cuban culture. They listen to the music, they cook food, sharing traditional recipes, and it's just very house warming. The author also loves his family, cherishing their presence. He doesn't argue with them and they enjoy the time they have together, creating lasting memories. I think the author is joyful with all the happiness that surrounds him at his house, painting a picture of contentment and familial love.
818	12644	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a very humble, caring, and grateful mood in his memoir. The humility shows when he describes how, although rich and inviting on the inside, his house was simple and ""modest"" on the outside, suggesting an understated elegance. All of the home's warmth and comfort was crammed into a three-room apartment. The sense of caring was demonstrated throughout the whole memoir in the way that Rodriguez referred to not just his blood-relatives, but the friends and neighbors whom he considered ""family,"" showcasing a deep sense of connection. Of his parents, he says that they ""always kept their arms and their door open"" to their community, highlighting their inclusive nature. Rodriguez expresses his gratitude again and again, especially in the sixth paragraph, demonstrating a recurring theme. He states that he could never thank his parents enough for the valuable lessons they instilled in him, especially their generosity and sense of community. These three themes set the mood of this memoir, establishing a portrait of a man deeply appreciative of his roots and the people who shaped him."
819	12645	5	3	The mood created by the author is quite comforting and homey. As the author describes his life growing up at home as a child, he seemed to have a pleasant life, filled with warmth and love. When he explained how grateful he was to have learned all the things he had from his family, it portrayed a simple but very enjoyable mood, highlighting the importance of familial bonds and shared experiences. When the author spoke of his family and friends that came to dine in the apartment that was made into a home, Narciso created a very relaxed mood, filled with laughter and conversation. Everyone who came to the Rodriguez's home was welcomed and treated as if they were close family, emphasizing their generosity and open hearts. The overall mood of this memoir is friendly and welcoming just as the Rodriguez's home was, leaving the reader with a sense of nostalgia and appreciation for the simple joys of life.
820	12646	5	3	In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he develops a very warm, comforting, and happy mood of where he grew up. Narciso Rodriguez tells us of how his parents came to the states and after living in a small, one room apartment for a while were able to move in to a three room apartment where he was born. He speaks of how his home was decorated in the traditional style, about the Cuban music always playing, filling the apartment with rhythm and joy, and of how his parents taught him to cook traditional dishes. Rodriguez also tells us of his diverse neighbor hood but of how they all came together in unity. Everyone cared for one other and they helped whoever was a need. If someone needed help they received it and people would sacrifice for others, sharing what little they had. The memoir depicts that Narciso Rodriguez grew up surrounded by the love of his family and the support of a close-knit community, instilling in him a sense of belonging and security.
821	12647	5	3	"The mood created by the author is loving because it talks about how generous and caring his family is. ""... @LOCATION1 graced our kitchen table for meals..."" That quote gives you an idea of how close everybody is, sharing not just food, but also their lives. ""...family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 around Narciso treats him like family, demonstrating that love extends beyond kinship. He learned what family really ment by living in this house during his childhood, shaping his understanding of connection and belonging. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In the memoir you can see how Narciso loves his family and friends, appreciating the bonds they forged. Overall the main mood of this memoir is loving, a testament to the power of chosen family and the enduring impact of a nurturing upbringing."
822	12648	5	3	The author creates a simple but peaceful and happy mood with the way he describes things. In paragraph @NUM1 he describes his home growing up in great DETAIL that makes it feel almost like you are there. Also, words he used to describe the neighborhood like hardworking and close-knit, help set the mood for the story. It makes you think of your own family and the positive aspects of community. Ultimately, this contributes to the overall feeling of warmth the author successfully creates.
823	12649	5	3	"Home is where the heart is, many have said this and many more have meant it. In the non-fictional memoir by @PERSON1 talks about the importance of family. Narciso paints many moods into the story and describes them with such grace. ""Friends and celebrations both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (paragraf @NUM1) This gives a sense that for him home was the safest and happiest place for him to be. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" (paragraf @NUM2) This gives off the mood that his home was a very caring place and that anyone that they loved was cared for. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'."" (paragraf @NUM3). This sets the mood that he was never really alone and that he had people with him at all times that cared and loved for him like he loved for them. ""My parents turned this simple house into a home."" (paragraf @NUM3) It seems that Narciso deeply treasures the memories and lessons learned within the walls of his childhood home."
824	12650	5	3	"The mood that was created by the author is something that not alot of people have. In the selection Narciso shows that he is thankful for being cuban living in the united states. His parents moved to Newark, New Jersey after living in cuba to give their children a better like. Narciso has ""a love of cooking"" because he was raised with his parents both cooking and having cullinary skills; he was passionate of cuban music which ""filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen,"" a sensory experience that shaped his identity. To Narciso, growing up in his envirenment family had nothing to do with blood relative and, was more as someone who you think of as to being like family. For Narciso there was no way for him to show the gratitude and generosity that he got in such an early age, which underscores how profoundly these experiences shaped his character. And how important he learned that family and friends are. This reinforces the sentiment that his upbringing instilled in him a deep appreciation for community and the non-biological bonds that define family."
825	12651	5	3	"The mood created by the author was great. He made it so Narciso was very happy and proud to have grown up in Cuba. He also made it so Narciso was grateful for everything. For example, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills, and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful)."" This passage exemplifies the positive and appreciative tone the author establishes. The mood created by the author was a great mood, contributing to a sense of warmth and nostalgia."
826	12652	5	3	The mood is very loving and happy. The way he talks about the neighborhood he grew up in, where everyone knew each other and looked out for one another, shows that sense of community. Then how he talked about how caring and unselfish his parents were, always putting others before themselves, further contributes to the positive atmosphere. Just how grateful he is for these experiences and the people in his life made the memoir very happy. This appreciation shines through, leaving the reader with a feeling of warmth and contentment.
827	12653	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and grateful. He is grateful that his parents give up everything that they had just to give him a better life. In the memoir it says: ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, careers, and the country they loved."" This sacrifice resonates deeply with him. He is happy because he has an opportunity to have a better life and that he learned the real defition of family, understanding the strength and resilience forged through shared experiences and unwavering support. In conclusion the mood for this memoir is happy and grateful."
828	12654	5	3	"The mood is well many different things. But mainly the mood is loving. I think it's mainly loving because in the memoir at both the begining and end, Narciso talks about how nice, sweet, and caring his parents are. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" And in that sentence you can see that both Narciso's mother and father would always welcome people into their house, demonstrating a sense of warmth and familial love. This consistent portrayal of his parents' generosity really solidifies the loving mood."
829	12655	5	3	"In the story, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the home created by the parents in the memoir was a very soft home because they are all grateful for what being going on with their lives like the parents said in paragraph 6 ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. it was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house towards gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Because of the love and memories created within its walls, the house transcended its physical structure to become a true home, deeply etched in his memory."
830	12656	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood created by the author is one of gratefulness. I know this because in the memoir it says, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This evidence shows how Narciso Rodriguez was grateful, which contributes to the overall mood of the memoir. He continues by stating his appreciation for his upbringing: ""His parents taught him how to love his culture, (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" The author's word choice demonstrates that the prevailing mood of the memoir is indeed grateful. This feeling of thankfulness permeates the text, shaping the reader's experience and understanding of the author's reflections."
831	12657	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez's ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" creates a very optimistic mood. Narciso describes how even though ""at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States,"" he and his ""family"" (which included foreign neighbors) still overcame adversity and found strength in unity. In addition, he describes how even though his neighborhood shared different cultural backgrounds, they still lived together harmoniously as a family, fostering a sense of belonging. Lastly, he describes all the cherished memories and vibrant celebrations that helped transform his house from a mere living space into a place of profound love and enduring friendship. It is easy to tell that Narciso deeply loved his family and friends equally, and their influence shaped his life in a positive and meaningful way."
832	12658	5	3	I was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and when I celebrated my first birthday. I was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of family. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there, how to love, how to share what little we had, and how to find joy in togetherness. I will never forget this house.
833	12659	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" a clothing designer who grew up in New Jersey with immigrants, the mood is that home isn't a physical space but relationships. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" Rodriguez states. He experienced a ""Close-Knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants."" It's unlikely Narciso would be the same clothing designer if he hadn't grown up surrounded by these individuals, as their influence shaped his understanding of connection and belonging, which likely informs his creative vision."
834	12660	5	3	"The mood the author created was gratefulness. Narciso is grateful for his parents' sacrifice to live in America. This gave him a better life. The author writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also, he admired their strength and perseverance. In the text it says, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance..."" Furthermore, he says that he will never forget how his parents turned a house into a home. That is the mood the author creates in the memoir."
835	12661	5	3	The @CAPS1 created by the author in the memoir was regular because in the story (Narciso Rodriguez) he explains his life a little to the reader. He explains how they lived in Cuba, then moved to America, and the boy also explains how he loves his home, celebrations, and heritage in America. The boy talks with a somewhat smart tone because he's really explaining his life from then, not about really now and here, and he likes it, so there's no anger in this story. This straightforward narrative style creates a sense of normalcy and reflection, shaping a @CAPS1 that is approachable and relatable, as he fondly remembers and appreciates his journey and cultural identity.
836	12662	5	3	In this article the author kind of gave a both happy and proud mood. He loved where he came from, his roots so to speak. Where he was raised, and mainly the life his parents provided for him. He adores his parents and couldn't be more gratefull. They turned a house into a home, filling it with love and laughter. They didn't need thousands to be happy all they needed was each other...and they did. He is what he is and that's extremly proud of his Cuban life and family, their values, and the sacrifices they made. Ultimately, his upbringing shaped him, and he embraces his identity with joy.
837	12663	5	3	The mood created by the author is that @PERSON1 is grateful for his education and growing up in @LOCATION1. He appreciates the opportunities afforded to him. Also, he cherishes his parents and their cooking skills, remembering the warmth and comfort their meals provided. The mood is one of love and gratefulness, reflecting a deep appreciation for his upbringing and the people who shaped him, leaving him with a sense of contentment.
838	12664	5	3	The mood in this memoir is very happy. It kind of shows how lucky we are, by showing how grateful they are to be here in @LOCATION1. The mood is also joyful, reflecting a deep appreciation for their current circumstances and the simple pleasures of life in their new home. This overall positive tone serves to highlight the good fortune they feel.
839	12665	5	3	"@PERSON1 uses a very happy tone and mood when talking about his home. His parents passed on to him their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with him today (and for which he is eternally grateful). Narciso is very happy he learned such great cooking in his childhood. ""Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@NUM1). Being so happy made this such a warm home in @CAPS1. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM2). Narciso summed up his entire article in one sentence, creating what most people feel at home. At my home I feel everything Narciso does because it's not where you live, it's how you live, demonstrating that the feeling of home is built on experiences and love, not just a physical place."
840	12666	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez the mood is calm and they are happy. I think this because they talk mainly about the good things in their childhood. They also say how much they loved their family. If you don't love or have a family as a child you would not be happy and they were. They reminisce fondly about family gatherings and the warmth of their home. My last reason is they were most grateful for their home and how their parents turned a house into a home, filling it with love and creating lasting memories. This is why I think the author's mood is happy and calm, reflecting a positive and appreciative outlook on their formative years."
841	12667	5	3	"I think the mood is happiness because when she was talking about his cooking skills and how she was listening to Cuban music in parenthesis it said stuff like ""which I still love today."" When she said ""our house became a home"" I think that meant that they are happy, settled in, there's not a lot of stress, and everyone seems comfortable. She kept saying how much she was thankful for having such great parents and a great house. It just made me think she has to be really happy with her family, her house, and her life. She must be happy with her life here in Miami, given the Cuban music and family atmosphere she describes. Her positive reflections on the past clearly indicate a deep-seated happiness and contentment with her present situation."
842	12668	5	3	The mood of this memoir is positive and caring. The reason why this story is caring is because they cared for all the people who stayed there, and they aided them until those people could move on to better situations. And the reason why this story is positive is because the parents are always having fun cooking, since that's their favorite thing to do, and they're always having fun together. These details clearly establish the memoir's overall positive and caring mood.
843	12669	5	3	"The mood created by the author is a happy, reflective memoir on the author's family life growing up. It talks about how warm and caring the author's household was and how it got to be like that. The author sets the mood in the memoir by talking about what was going on in the household: ""Our traditional Cuban home, where the very heart of which was the kitchen."" The author talks about her family's love for cooking and the happy mood of the house with the ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" The author also talks about the close-knit community of honest, hardworking migrants who lived in the surrounding homes; they were all friends that took care of each other, knowing that anyone would do the same for them as well. The author is able to keep the mood happy in the memoir by talking about how he will ""always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" making it a loving, caring story to read about his childhood. The memoir paints a vivid picture of a joyful upbringing rooted in family, community, and gratitude, leaving the reader with a sense of warmth and appreciation for the author's experiences."
844	12670	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author was very happy and grateful. I know he is happy in this memoir because in paragraph @NUM1 he writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" This is a happy setting where the author grew up in, surrounded by familial affection and cultural richness. The author was also very grateful to his parents. I know this because in paragraph @NUM2 he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows the deep appreciation and affection the author felt growing up, acknowledging the immense contributions his parents made to his life and well-being, making it evident that Rodriguez cherished his upbringing and the foundation it provided."
845	12671	5	3	"The author creates a mood of appreciation for his house and parents. The author expresses that his parents selflessly sacrificed their own well-being for their children. “They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially...” This illustrates the significant sacrifices his parents made, leaving behind their familiar lives in Cuba for the sake of their children's future, leading to deep gratitude. Furthermore, his parents instilled invaluable life lessons through their actions, as stated, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... I've often told them the admiration for their strength and perseverance... and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" This emphasizes that his parents taught him something important without explicitly stating it, but by demonstrating it. The house also served as a place where he ""learned the real definition of 'family',"" highlighting the importance of his upbringing. Thus, through their sacrifices, lessons, and the environment of his childhood home, the author conveys a strong sense of appreciation for his parents and the values they instilled in him, shaping his life in a profound way."
846	12672	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy, loving, content mood. This mood is created by Narciso talking about what a great and happy life his parents made for him. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" It just sounds so happy and loving to me. He also says things like ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" That's another example of the loving happy mood in this memoir because he's talking about how people were so helpful and gracious to anyone in need, and it makes me feel so happy that people are like that. This portrayal of a supportive community further enhances the positive atmosphere. I really enjoyed reading this memoir because it was all about people's love toward each other, which set a very happy, light-hearted mood for me, ultimately making for an enjoyable and uplifting reading experience."
847	12673	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, by Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author is gratitude. First, Narciso loved his parents and was very grateful for everything they did. Rodriguez says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"" (@NUM1). Narciso's parents came to the US just for him and he is so grateful. Secondly, he says he has thanked them so many times but he doesn't know how. Rodriguez says, ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me"" (@NUM1). He is so thankful he doesn't even know how to put it in words, Narciso knows even though they only had a three ñ room apartment he knew it was special. Narciso states, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM3). His parents couldnt give him much because they didn't have much money but it meant the world to him. Clearly, the mood of this passage is gratitude. He appreciates their sacrifices and the loving home they created despite their limited resources; this sense of deep appreciation permeates the entire passage."
848	12674	5	3	The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is hopeful, heart lifting, caring, grateful, lively, loving, and courageous. It's hopeful because Narciso's parents had to start their lives all over with any jobs they could find and they wouldn't have made it without hope. They had hope in their children when they came to America to have great and prosperous lives. It's also heart lifting because it was about how their parents came to America for their kids and they ended up successful in life and became someone. Having people for dinner, housing others in need, and always ready for more to come who fell down in their lives and need some comfort shows as much care as a parent is to their newborn. Narciso's parents showed him what family, and friends are and to have courage and persevere. He is very grateful of his parents for these important lessons of life: They didn't just tell him, they showed him through their lives which makes it much more effective. They always had life in their home because of the music and aromas in the air and all of the people that came for dinner or to stay for a short time. His parents must have had courage to throw away their life's work, come to America for better lives for their children, and to start a new career. The mood was very important to really feel the message of the memoir, showcasing the immigrant experience and the power of family love.
849	12675	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is a very relaxed and happy mood. Narciso is always happy in the house, there was always the smell of food, and his parents cooking. There was always a strong sense of family and the house too. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso said that ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" What he is saying is that you don't have to be related to be family; anyone close enough can be considered family. He also felt that you should always help people in need. That is what his parents did; they always helped people when they needed it and were always willing to share everything they had. This sharing and support created a loving atmosphere. That is the mood instilled in this memoir about family and love."
850	12676	5	3	"I think the mood of the passage @ORGANIZATION1 by The Blueprints of our Lives is a very @CAPS1 mood because in the passage it @CAPS6 ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" I believe this means that @CAPS2 is thankful that her parents provided him/her with a good home. Another reason I think that the mood of the @CAPS3 is @CAPS1 because in the story the @CAPS3 @CAPS6 ""I will never forget new my parents turned his Simple house into a home."" I think this means that the @CAPS3 is @CAPS8 and that is the mood I believe the article is about, which ultimately makes the passage express a sense of deep appreciation and gratitude."
851	12677	5	3	the mood givin by the @CAPS1 (In My prospective) is happy becaus even if you had to move to @LOCATION1 away from his loved ones he still managed to be happy with his family in @LOCATION1, finding joy and contentment in their new environment, which ultimately suggests a positive and resilient outlook.
852	12678	5	3	The mood that was created @CAPS1 in the passage @CAPS2 is a happy, loving mood. The reason I say this is @CAPS3 because if you read the passage you'll see that in his home it was all about love and care. So in the end they have mad a Home and a @CAPS4 loving relationship together and with other people. the authors family @CAPS5 welcomed in their home people that they considered Family, this right here is a mood well a caring mood, which overall demonstrates the warmth and affection present within the family dynamic.
853	12679	5	3	"In the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by The Blueprints of our lives the mood of the author in the memoir was he was thankful for everything he got so like the mood was quite and loving I picked quite because he has grew up nothing really exciting happened in his life he grew up in New Jersey and his parents were from CUBA parents were very nice people and alway wanted to give their kid a better life and he's alway been grateful for his parents they were the originally parents that made his life not that much excitiing and also picked loved as a mood because in the article ""always filled the air with not just scent in misic but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of family meaning his mood was he felt loved by his family. Thats why chose quite and loving, reflecting the peaceful gratitude and strong familial affection woven throughout his upbringing."
854	12680	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is gentle and proud. The author explains how he felt about his parents, who risked everything in order to give him a better future, according to paragraph @NUM1. The author feels proud of being from Cuba throughout the whole memoir. He feels proud of being Cuban by explaining the things he does and things that are shared through his culture. Last but not least, he feels thankfulness, according to paragraph @NUM2, because, through his parents and things from his country, he learned what family really means, and he says ""... I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". Consequently, the author shows pride in where he came from, from his parents, country, and his neighborhood, culminating in a portrait of gratitude and affection."
855	12681	5	3	The mood the author is creating is sad. Because he is talking about his whole family and his house, recalling the happy times within those walls. He remembers how he had so many good memories there and his first friend, a bond forged in childhood innocence. This kind of mood is sad, tinged with a sense of loss and nostalgia for a past that can never be fully reclaimed.
856	12682	5	3	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" I think the author was very grateful and happy at the moment. I think he was happy because he was elaborating about how Narciso was always in a good mood and how she always loved to cook in the kitchen with everyone. Also, how she still loved her ritual song she sings with her family, highlighting the joy and connection that this tradition brought to their lives. This suggests a deep appreciation for Narciso's positive spirit and the warmth of their shared family experiences, leading to the conclusion that the author's happiness stems from these cherished moments."
857	12683	5	3	"The mood that was created by this author was love. It was love by how he described his house. ""The passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This combination of cooking and music you usually associate with love, and love is happiness. The author also talks about his ""close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, not necessarily their own kind were clearly in need."" This also shows the mood in this memoir is love, love of cooking, of music, and of family. Another place where it showed love in the memoir was in this quote: ""My Parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows love because even though these people aren't blood-related, they still look out for each other and knew they had someone to lean on, illustrating a deep affection and care. The apparent mood in this story was love, and the family had much of it."
858	12684	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is Love. In paragraph @NUM1. It says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This suggests a deep appreciation for connection and belonging. Thus, there will always be love and happiness in your home if you just respect your friends and your loved ones, nurturing those bonds. Life would be good, filled with joy and a sense of security derived from strong relationships."
859	12685	5	3	In the memoir, the author creates a mood of love and community. In paragraph two the author describes his childhood home with words like traditional, passionate, and congregation. These words set the tone for the rest of the memoir in which love in helping the community are key themes. It gives me the feeling that I could walk into their home and be welcomed with open arms even as a complete stranger, an idea fostered by the comforting imagery. These themes are reinforced in the last few sentences when the author ends speaking about his gracious neighborhood and how he learned to love, solidifying the memoir's central message of the power of communal bonds.
860	12686	5	3	"The mood created by the author is happiness and gratefulness. Reading this made me feel very thankful. The author thanks his parents several times. He talks about how he learned how to cook from his parents and says ""and for which I am eternally grateful"" in paragraph @NUM1, and in paragraph @NUM2 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I think those specific quotes from the memoirs show how grateful the author is feeling. Reading this made me feel grateful for what I have, and think of all my parents did for me and sacrificed. I also think this sentence from paragraph @NUM3 supports the author wanting you to feel grateful: ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" I also think happy, because the author is looking back at his life and states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This made my mood become happy, and it is clear that the author's purpose was to instill a sense of appreciation in the reader."
861	12687	5	3	The home radiated a warm, happy feeling, a haven of safety and contentment, one of those perfect homes where worries seemed to simply melt away. It was a caring home, filled with the laughter of countless friends and the enduring embrace of family, a place where love had blossomed for a long, long time. This created a sense of security and belonging, solidifying the happy atmosphere.
862	12688	5	3	"The mood that the author creates is kind of happy for what he has. ""In our neighborhood, despite costums elsewhere, all of their cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The quote highlights how the author thinks of the different cultures uniting together, showing a sense of contentment and appreciation for the harmonious environment he experiences. This suggests a positive outlook and a celebration of the unique blending of traditions within his community, ultimately contributing to the author's overall sense of well-being and joy."
863	12689	5	3	"In the memoir ""@CAPS1 Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by @CAPS2 is shocking. First, on page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2 Rodriguez wrote, ""I would not know my 'real' grandparents... leave Cuba."" Here, Rodriguez is talking about how she never meat @CAPS2 real grandparents until they left Cuba in 1970. This is important because early in the memoir she said @CAPS2 surrogate grandparents (Sergio, Edelmira) came to eat dinner. In conclusion, in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by @CAPS2 is shocking, @CAPS2 real grandparents come to @ORGANIZATION1 in 1970, showing the complex dynamics of family during that time. She wanted to write this because she wanted to teach the reader to know the real deftion of family."
864	12690	5	3	"The mood created by the author is a loving and caring mood. In the second paragraph, he describes the house as having the rich culinary cooking of his parents, the passionate Cuban music filled in the air, the aromas of the kitchen in their warm home. He tells that in their house they have feasts, also the many immigrants they invite into their house until they can leave by themselves or find a place to live. He describes family has nothing to do with blood relatives; everybody in their neighborhood is family and they care for each other and care for any of the people who need help. At the end he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" He tells how they taught him love and the real definition of family, describing their house as being a warm and welcoming space, a true testament to the power of compassion."
865	12691	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is love and happiness, illustrating how family are friends. In the memoir, he expands on how his mom and dad gave up everything for their child and his life. They had to change everything they did in Cuba; for example, the jobs. In Cuba, his dad had worked in a laboratory, and his mom had studied chemical engineering, professions they might have to give up. This sacrifice underscores the deep love and commitment that define the heartwarming mood of the memoir.
866	12692	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is grateful and content. The author emphasizes this mood with his quotes that the author puts in. ""I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" That shows that the author did not care that much about house looks, price or its location. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of family... [that it] had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The author is grateful for all the people that the author now considers his ""family"". Also, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"". That highlights right in the quote that the author is feeling grateful! The author also puts some phrases in parentheses, just to add a bit more, ""(after which I eternally grateful)"", ""(which I adore to this day)"". Those show the author is happy and grateful with his life, and last this next quote exemplifies that his ""family"" members were all grateful for each other. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necissarily their own kind, were clearly in need"". Overall, the author's word choice and included anecdotes clearly convey a sense of deep gratitude and contentment with his life and the people in it."
867	12693	5	3	"The mood created by the author is friendship and love. When the author's parents moved to the United States, They created a traditional home, the heart being the kitchen. ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" In the kitchen celebrations, childhood, friends, and family formed the backdrop to their life. The author learned that '""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.' The neighborhood the author lived in is made up of many different cultures but they blend with each other to form a small community of honest, hard-working immigrants who help others when they themselves are in need. ""My parent's always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family."" The many immigrants gave up their lives in Cuba to move to the US to make a better life for their children even though they did not know the language or culture. The author will always be thankful to her parents for that reason. There is no way to show her thanks for her parents' love and sacrifice that they showed to her when she was just a child, showing her the importance of family and friends. The author states ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" They didn't just change it; they did it through love and friendship, crafting a sanctuary built on shared experiences and unwavering support."
868	12694	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was loving and caringness. Repeatedly throughout the memoir, the speaker Narciso Rodriguez shows what his family did after migrating from their native country, Cuba, to show their love. As said, his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family, knowing that they would do the same for them. They cared for their children's future by leaving their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. All though ""they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships,"" they had to do what they thought was best for their children's well-being. Their simple house was the best place for them to be together as a family, as it fostered a sense of unity. ""The warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"" further emphasizes the strong family bond. This memoir made me connect this family to mines given how similar it is. Without love it isn't a family, that's why at the end of the word ""family"" the i, l, y stand for ""i love you,"" which highlights the central role of affection and care in their familial relationships."
869	12695	5	3	This memoir gives me a sort of cozy and comfortable feeling. When it talks about a family being not only people that are blood-related to you I think of my friends and the people I can count on; they are my family too. He also talks about how a house is not necessarily a home, not without memories, your family, and something or someone that you trust. Lastly, he tells us about how greatful he is that his parents brought him to a neighborhood that he would soon learn to love, a sentiment that resonates deeply. This piece makes me think about and appreciate my family, and my home, reminding me of the importance of both.
870	12696	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of warmth and good feeling, reflecting a reality centered around family. This is evident in the depiction of family members coming to live with them until they could re-establish themselves, the constant presence of relatives, and the transformation of a ""house into a Home."" Endless celebrations form a backdrop to life in their warm home. ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in their country they loved."" ""The barriers to work were strong and high and my parents both accepted that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they had deserved."" ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr.. Had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied Chemical Engineering."" In @LOCATION3, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. This narrative highlights the sacrifices made and the resilience displayed in the face of adversity, as they navigated a new country and unfamiliar job market. ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times,"" ultimately contributing to the overarching feeling of hope and familial love that permeates the author's recollections."
871	12697	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is loving, caring, and gratefulness. Throughout the memoir the author continuously mentions how grateful she is to her parents and how much she loves them. She says that ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author means that she's thankful her parents loved her enough to give up their home, jobs, and friends, all to give her a better life. She also says that ""what they [her parents] did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" Narciso is stating that it takes a lot of courage to go forward to an unknown future, and she's very grateful that her parents did. These quotes, filled with appreciation and respect, showcase the loving, caring, and gratefulness expressed in the memoir by the author, solidifying the overall positive and thankful tone."
872	12698	5	3	"The mood is a mixture of things; it's really hard to say with all the emotions the author throws around. However, the strongest feeling is unity and family. I'm not sure family can be called an emotion, but it is, I think, something that can be described by several. One, of course, is unity, or as he says it, ""great solidarity and friendship."" It's rather sweet how he characterizes family as something like the bonds you make with people, in contrast to other cultures where family is from blood ties and family is always first. So, in a way, I think his way of thinking comes from his culture, shaping his understanding of familial connections. But also, he puts in a bit of sadness but overall seems to be extremely thankful for what he has. As they say, ""happiness is nothing without appreciating it,"" and as he says, ""I learned the real definition of family,"" suggesting he now possesses a deeper understanding of true happiness and belonging."
873	12699	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is of happiness, peace, and gratitude. Narciso is thankful for all that his parents had sacrificed and taught him. His overall tone in the memoir is translated into a happy and peaceful mood. Narciso writes ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life to our warm home."" The tone in this quote is calm and friendly, as Narciso explains the happiness of his life at home. By saying his house was ""warm"" with celebrations for family and friends, it constructs the peaceful mood of the memoir. Narciso also recalls the delicious food that was always present, further contributing to the warmth.  Narciso goes on to explain that ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" Here, Rodriguez adds to the peaceful mood by speaking of generosity, and care towards family. It is the idea of family that fueled his loving childhood. The mood turns to gratitude as Narciso thanks his parents for giving him a better life, though they had to endure difficult jobs and conditions. He expresses that he had ""no way to express [his] gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon [him],"" and ""the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The concepts of family, love, and generosity Narciso learned from his parents formed the basis of the gracious, happy, and tranquil mood of his memoir, as well as his life."
874	12700	5	3	"The author created a tone in the memoir that was truthful and grateful and pride inducing. ""pasionate Cuban music... Filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations... that formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (paragraph 1). The former quote found in paragraph 1 described the pride and gratefulness of the home in which the author lived. The memoir created a Family love which every person longs for in life. "" They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" (paragraph 3). Anyone who can sacrifice like that for the better life of their family is a good person. That is the family love I am describing being selfless and loving to other members of your family. Another mood created in the memoir was pride in the family's sacrifice. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a more courageous thing than I could have ever done"" (paragraph 4). That was a quote from paragraph 4. It shows that you have to be thankful for the sacrifices people make for you. All of which make the qualities of a good family life, showcasing the memoir's heartwarming portrayal of family bonds and the appreciation for selfless acts."
875	12701	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very happy because the atmosphere is filled with family and friends, also joy and happiness. He considered everyone family even though the times were not the greatest for everyone. His parents also gave up a lot so he could have a good life in @LOCATION1, showing their deep love. He is very grateful for his parents bringing him to @LOCATION1 so he could have a good life, even though they had to leave their life in Cuba to come here for him, revealing his appreciation for their sacrifice. This strong sense of gratitude and familial warmth is what defines the happy mood created by the author in the memoir.
876	12702	5	3	The mood created by this memoir is a relaxed, caring kind of mood. Several parts of this work emphasize this mood. The author often writes about how he loves his parents for their selflessness in providing for him and his siblings. This emphasizes the mood, and he repeats it many times, often highlighting specific sacrifices they made, and the repetition helps build mood as well. A final thing that helps the mood is how he describes how everyone in his neighborhood was kind to each other, always willing to lend a hand or offer support. In conclusion, there are many things in this work that emphasize a relaxed, caring mood, fostering a sense of warmth and community.
877	12703	5	3	Within the walls of Narciso, her young parents created their traditional home. Their heart was the kitchen. Narciso's parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on their rich culinary skills to Narciso; she loved to cook. Quite the contrary, Narciso's neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish and Italian immigrants at a time of racism. Her parents came selflessly, as some immigrants will do, to give their children a better life. They sacrificed leaving their family, friends, and careers in the country they came from. I think her memory is a nice, happy one because with those memories she knows what her family went through to provide her with opportunities.
878	12704	5	3	"The mood created by the author was love from his family. The author describes ""a love of (Cuban) cooking which is still with me (the author) today"" and how he also has a love of ""passionate Cuban music which I (the author) still adore today."" The author got this love from his parents, which shows the impact of their affection. Another way the author created the mood of love was by talking about how his ""parents always kept their arms and door open."" It shows generosity and how welcoming his family was to others. The author is speaking very lovingly at this point in the story, highlighting the warmth of his upbringing. The author also says that he ""will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice,"" further emphasizing the deep bond. The mood that the author set during the story was love. I think that this was a really good mood to set in a story, creating a heartwarming and appreciative tone."
879	12705	5	3	"I think the mood created by the author was gratefulness towards his parents. Narciso Rodriguez wants to tell his parents how very special they are to him and how much he thanks them for what they did for him. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez says that ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This highlights a recurring theme of appreciation. I think that in this memoir, Narciso wants the reader to understand how he feels about his family. He wants to tell us about what they did for him, emphasizing their impact on his life. Narciso thanks his parents for their sacrifice and I think by telling us his story, the mood that was created was gratefulness towards the parents who made him a 'home.' This feeling of gratitude permeates the narrative, shaping the reader's understanding of Rodriguez's deep connection to his family and the sacrifices they made for him."
880	12706	5	3	"In this excerpt from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, @PERSON1 talks about the true meaning of ""family"" and the mood of gratitude is established.""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills... Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" In this passage, @PERSON1 is establishing his gratitude for the cultures of his family. He is grateful for the food and music that has wound its way into his present day life. My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" This quote explains how much @PERSON1's parents sacrificed for his happiness, and his deep appreciation is apparent. They left behind everything and everyone they loved, basically a huge chunk of them, and for that, he is extremely grateful, showing a profound understanding of their sacrifices and a commitment to honoring their legacy through his own life."
881	12707	5	3	"The @TONE in the @STORY is different and uneek to other I have heard. I belive that the @TONE the @AUTHOR is trying to make is happyness, and selflessness, and grateful. I think this because he describes his parents As selflessness and takes everyone in to theire small Apartment. I also think he is creating ""warth"" by saying that his first birthday with his parent Are comfortting That is the @TONE I belive the @AUTHOR is trying to create. This use of unique tone helps establish a connection with readers."
882	12708	5	3	c.The mood in this passage reflects Narciso Rodriguez's pride in his heritage, nationality, and his family. He often talks about his nationality. He is proud to be born in Cuba and not afraid to say it. He is also married. He lives in the 2000's in America. He also often talks about his one bedroom apartment in Newark, New Jersey. He also likes to talk about the new friends he made here and his family. Also Narciso childhood, and his neighborhood is made out of Cubans, and Puerto Ricans. That was the memoir of this passage, highlighting his strong sense of identity and connection to his roots.
883	12709	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is grateful. It is grateful in a few ways. One way is in paragraph six he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because they moved to the United States from Cuba. Another way is in paragraph nine he says ""my parents both shared cooking duties an unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I admired to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because of their Cuban culture and specifically their cooking skills being passed on to him. Those are some reasons why the mood of the memoir is grateful."
884	12710	5	3	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful. Narciso is thankful for his parents support and love. When he talks about how he feels about his parents, he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM1). The words ""grateful for their love and sacrifice"" demonstrates that through his whole life they were there for him. They didnt just tell her what to do, they showed her. When he talks about the life lessons he has learned from his parents, he says ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life"" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM1). The words ""basis of my life"" demonstrates that they taught him how to live (the essentials to living). They also showed him the meaning of family. He doesn't just think family is blood related, ""It was here when I learned the real definition of ""family"""" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM4). The words ""definition of family"" demonstrates that he is thankful for them teaching him what family means to them. In conclusion, the mood of this passage is grateful."
885	12711	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy one because Narciso was happy with all her parents did for her, and the neighborhood was a peaceful one; everybody reached out to help whoever needed help, fostering a strong sense of community and belonging that contributed to the overall joyful tone. This shared support and familial love painted a picture of contentment and security. This idyllic portrayal ultimately shapes the reader's positive perception of Narciso's early life.
886	12712	5	3	The memoir looks back on his childhood, with fondness, so I'd call the mood wistful. Yes, the author creates a wistful mood by talking about his childhood home, friends and family. But wistfulness only lasts until the end of paragraph @NUM1; after that it becomes a grateful mood, where he's giving out thanks and describing what his parents went through. If it is possible to have two moods, then this memoir does. The moods are both wistful and grateful, creating a complex and layered emotional experience for the reader.
887	12713	5	3	The mood of the author and the memoir is greatful. The author is very greatful for his parents. He is thankful for his parents because they gave up their life for him. They moved from their country so that he could grow up in @LOCATION1. His parents quit their jobs and came over all for him. He is also greatful for his extended family and friends. They are the ones who he eats with, plays with and etc. He takes care of them and they take care of him. They are his surrogate grandparents, aunts, uncles cousins and friends. He is also thank full for his culture. All his food along with traditions come from cuba. The author is greatful, and his gratitude reflects the sacrifices and support that have shaped his life.
888	12714	5	3	The mood that the author created in the memoir was so sad and happy, and they were interested in sharing personal reflections. I think that this memoir is a good one, and I liked the title of it, *Narciso Rodriguez*. Therefore, I recommend this book because of its emotional impact and engaging narrative.
889	12715	5	3	"The mood created by the author is both EMPATHY and love. At first the mood the author created was EMPATHY. In paragraph ONE it says ""They struggled both personally and financially."" Narciso explains the tragedies his parents had to face in order for him to live in AMERICA. So by reading the excerpt based on the poverty and struggles his family faced makes you grow EMPATHY for them. I also chose love. In the excerpt it states, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" FURTHER IN the excerpt the author explains the love he learned to form for the ""family"" FURTHER IN the neighborhood. Therefore that's why I think love is another mood created by the author. These are the reasons I chose both EMPATHY and love for the moods created by the author based on the excerpt, because the author demonstrates both the hardships faced and the deep affection developed."
890	12716	5	3	In this memoir the mood was created by Narciso and his family. Narciso's family created the mood by bringing all of the family together in their old home in Cuba and their new home in Miami. Narciso brought the mood in this memoir by loving his family and telling them every day that he is thankful for everything that they did for him when he was just a child to when he was grown up. Also, Narciso's family took people in when they had nowhere to go, and they stayed with them until they got back on their feet, thus establishing a warm and grateful tone throughout the narrative.
891	12717	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways. The mood that the author created was confusing because I see more than one too many times. Some of them are happiness, pride, sadness, and others. It's because the memoir talks about Narciso Rodriguez's life. The mood created by the author can be hard to describe precisely since there's a variety of emotions presented. This complexity in mood reflects the multifaceted nature of a life story, making it difficult to pinpoint a single, overarching feeling.
892	12718	5	3	The author creates a bittersweet but happy mood and shows bittersweet parts and happy parts in the narrative about a boy whos parents immigrated. His house was what he grew up in, a constant reminder of his roots, and his parents put a Cuban twist to it, filling it with vibrant colors and the aroma of traditional dishes, creating a unique atmosphere.
893	12719	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness because in mostly all of the paragraphs he talks about how much he loves his parents and his cuban culture. Narciso talks about how his parents made his everyday house into a home. That is why I think Narciso is happy in this memoir. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""Within the walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was my kitchen,"" further emphasizing the central role of family and culture in his joyful upbringing. This strong connection to his roots clearly contributes to the overall feeling of contentment expressed throughout the memoir."
894	12720	5	3	"The author is very happy and satisfied with the family he has and what his family has done. The author appreciates what his parents have done, especially considering their own parents immigrated from Cuba, facing numerous challenges. He dedicates what he has learned, such as cooking traditional Cuban dishes, displaying proper manners, and valuing friendship, to his parents' guidance and example. The author ""admires their strength and perseverance and have thanked them repeatedly"" for instilling these crucial values. Overall the author could not have had a better family than this; they showed him how to live a good life, filled with love, respect, and cultural pride, and that is what a family should accomplish."
895	12721	5	3	Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The blueprints of our Lives shared his feelings, traditions, and Love he shared with his family growing up. Narciso and his @CAPS1 mom and dad were cuban. they shared their cuban traditions with eachother and were warm and welcoming with eachother and other people. Narciso's family was generous to other people and shared with everyone. they were all kind to eachother and lived a traditional @CAPS2 life. Narciso emphasized a mood during the memoir .. The love and meaning of family. This emphasis truly showcased the importance of familial bonds.
896	12722	5	3	In this memoir it talks about what the true meaning of selflessness and a home really is. At the beginning of this memoir they talk about how their parents knew the struggles of life, the hardships of making ends meet. And would invite people into their home until they got back on their feet, offering them food and shelter. It was at least five years until the parents could afford a decent sized house, a testament to their generosity. Even though his parents left Cuba they still made an effort to keep all their Cuban traditions alive. His parents loved to cook traditional Cuban dishes and taught Narciso how to. They also play traditional Cuban music, filling the house with familiar sounds. Also, they taught him to be selfless, to think of others before himself. They would invite people over even if they weren't the same race because it didn't matter to them; what mattered was helping those in need, showing that true home lies not in walls, but in the kindness shared within.
897	12723	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir is love and unity. ""... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This means that they were close, loving, and unified. This memoir gave me the feeling that just a house is not a home until there is love. ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" further reinforces this feeling of warmth and love, suggesting a nurturing and connected environment. Ultimately, the author conveys that love and unity transform a mere dwelling into a cherished home."
898	12724	5	3	"In my opinion the mood is created by the author in the memoir by the setting and describing her childhood, where she was born and why her parents came here. The reason I think this is because the mood can create this setting, because the mood is the feeling in the story, such as sad, happy, lonely, silent and that is what creates the setting which is where, when, and time of the story. Some examples from the excerpt are, ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family building, in the Ironbound Section of Newark, New Jersey."" Also, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" The author is thankful for her Cuban heritage, as well, and her home is more about relationships than just space. Thus, the mood of belonging and gratitude is palpable, shaping the reader's understanding of the Ironbound setting as one of close-knit community. In this memoir the mood created the setting."
899	12725	5	3	"I particularly enjoyed this memoir. The author did a fantastic job at creating a sense of love and comfort while telling his story. The first sentence that stuck out to me was in paragraph @NUM1: ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" To me, that sentence was all about making people feel comfortable and at home. It put out a sense of family in the story. The feeling of love was easily put into the story at paragraph @NUM2, when the author talked about his family. Especially where the author had said ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. The family loved everybody, and used their love to help struggling people, or people who just wanted to visit, get back on their feet and stay in their home. This story was truly filled with dozens of examples of love and comfort, and I really enjoyed reading it."
900	12726	5	3	The mood is a family that tried to move from their home country to start a new life in a new country. The initial excitement of packing faded, replaced by a quiet apprehension as they boarded the plane. Leaving behind familiar streets and loved ones felt like severing a part of themselves. In the new country, the language barrier proved a constant hurdle, and simple tasks became monumental efforts. They missed the comfort of their old community, the shared history and understanding. Despite the challenges, they persevered, determined to build a future for their children, slowly adapting to their new surroundings and hoping to find a sense of belonging. Ultimately, their journey was a testament to their resilience and unwavering hope for a better tomorrow.
901	12727	5	3	"The mood the author created in this memoir was very proud. I could tell that the mood was like that because he would always talk about his parents and how they gave up so much to come here. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language Or culture... To give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" I could @CAPS1 feel the pride in that because he is talking about how his parents left everything basically for him. Also, he mentions how his parents opened their arms to whoever needed help even though they were not the richest people either. He gave many examples throughout the memoir that strongly showed the mood he made in this memoir, pride, and this is evident in his descriptions of their selflessness and sacrifice."
902	12728	5	3	The author creates a mood of happiness in the story. He states memories of his child that made him happy and nostalgic. He mentions the love that he had of cooking with his parents, remembering the warmth of those moments. He also mentions music as being passionate and that he still adores it even to this day, showing its lasting impact. He also describes how good his neighborhood was and how they were a close knit community, highlighting positive social connections. Then he starts to explain that a lot of his family was not just blood related but how it included other people, suggesting a broad definition of family. He then explained that his parents were very self sacrificing people, further emphasizing the positive influences in his life. So it was a very good mood the author wrote the story in, reflecting a life filled with joy and strong relationships.
903	12729	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez, the author shows a very strong mood relating to the piece. The emotions used to create the mood include passion, unity, and gratitude. The mood of this memoir has lots of passion. Narciso talks about his family's passion for their Cuban heritage, and how they shared it with him. That was a big component of turning that house into a home, and therefore, part of the mood that Rodriguez wanted to represent. ""... my young parents created our traditional Cuban home... love of cooking... passionate Cuban music..."" (Rodriguez, @NUM1). This passion extended beyond just music and food; it was a deep-seated love for their culture that permeated every aspect of their lives. I also could feel a sense of unity the author was trying to portray. "".. the congregation of family and friends..."" The author mentions several times his parents and him were always letting distant relatives stay at the house, and many friends and family came and shared dinner with them, reinforcing the theme of togetherness. The author even describes his community as a ""... a close-knit community..."" (Rodriguez, @NUM2). This sense of unity highlights the importance of relationships and shared experiences in shaping the author's identity. Lastly, a sense of gratitude runs along the spine of this piece. The author notes his parents were a huge part of his life, exposing his to his culture, family and friends, and they home. He doesn't even have to write how grateful he is, it is so evident. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" (Rodriguez, @NUM3). This deep appreciation underscores the positive impact of his upbringing on his life and career. The author created a mood filled with passion, unity, and gratitude. All of these emotions are evident in the text, creating a powerful and moving portrait of his life and influences."
904	12730	5	3	"The mood @CAPS1 creates is happy. He had no negative comment about his parents or the way he grew up. His parents sacrificed everything for him so he can have a better life. Also the feel of his home reflected on the mood. It was a warm and safe environment in paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" @CAPS2 can really tell that he loved his home and family and the reflected upon the mood, contributing to the overall joyful tone. Ultimately, the author's positive reflections establish a sense of contentment and gratitude."
905	12731	5	3	"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish-speaking families who, despite not sharing DNA, looked out for one another, creating a strong sense of community and belonging, ultimately redefining my understanding of kinship."
906	12732	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and family-like. The author goes on to describe his family, which were loving but poor. His family supported him by growing up in a happy, loving home, which helped shape who he became. They cooked nice food, and invited the relatives over to eat and share stories. The author shows that no matter if you're rich or poor, you can still have a closely knit family, and that love and connection are more valuable than material wealth.
907	12733	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir would be described as happy and thankful. I say that because the author talked about how his parents were caring and selfless individuals. They always helped out people in need within their community, offering support without expecting anything in return. The author loved how he grew up immersed in his vibrant Cuban culture, embracing its traditions and values, and how he would never forget it. He said that it was one household filled with love and laughter that he would never forget, a place that shaped him into the person he is today, instilling a deep sense of gratitude.
908	12734	5	3	"The mood created by the author is that he is really happy that his parents moved to America to live close to friends and family because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""countless extended family members came and went -- and there was always someone temporarily staying with us."" This constant influx of relatives suggests a warm and welcoming environment, filled with connection and support, making the author feel fortunate about his family's decision to relocate."
909	12735	5	3	"I feel that the mood(s) created by the author in the memoir is happy, proud, and grateful. I think that the author makes the memoir feel happy because he is saying that his parents were kind and they worked hard, and that made him happy, I think. Another mood I think is he was proud. He said (in paragraph @NUM1) that growing up in his environment instilled a great sense of family. His family welcomed other refugees from Cuba to celebrate their arrival to this country. Thanks to what he grew up in, he learned the real definition of family. The last mood I feel the author created was he was grateful. He said in paragraph @NUM2 that ""I will always be grateful for my parents' love and sacrifice."" He is grateful to his parents and how they ""turned a simple house into a home"" (paragraph @NUM3). Therefore, happiness, pride, and gratitude effectively capture the emotional landscape of the memoir."
910	12736	5	3	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1 from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, he creates a mood for the readers. The mood or feeling created in the story is mainly love. There are many things said in the memoir that express the mood of love. For example in paragraph two the author talks about the simple apartment that him and his parents lived in as a great place. He does this because he is so thankful to his parents because he loves them. The paragraph says, ""and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" Some people may not be as grateful about simple things like cooking, but Narciso loves his parents so much that he is extremely happy for even the little things they did for him. Instead of calling Sergio and Edelmira the neighbors who lived below us, they are called surrogate grandparents. This shows that they were very loved by Narciso, and that they were considered as part of the family. Paragraph three says ""Countless extended family members came and went and there was often someone staying with us temporarily."" This expresses the mood of love because again the neighbors are called family. Also, Narciso's parents allowed them to live with them because they love them and cared deeply about them. In paragraph four it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso sees what his parents did with their lives as an amazing thing because he loves them so much, and he appreciates everything they have done for him. When this memoir is read the mood of love is expressed throughout the whole story."
911	12737	5	3	In this memoir the author creates a feeling of gratefulness. @PERSON1 is grateful of his parents' unselfishness and the sacrifices they made for him, and his rich heritage. He loves his home country of Cuba and cherishes its vibrant culture. @PERSON1 is also thankful for his grandparents and the values they instilled in him. He loves his home in @LOCATION1 and is grateful for growing up in @LOCATION1, surrounded by familiar faces and cherished memories. He is also grateful that his grandparents made the courageous decision to come to @LOCATION1, paving the way for his own opportunities. Ultimately, he is thankful for the tapestry of experiences that have shaped him.
912	12738	5	3	"There is a mood created by the author in the memoir. One way in which the mood is created is by explaining how the warm life in the narrator's house was created. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This helps create the mood of the memoir because it is explaining how the narrator grew up in an environment filled with love and joy. Another way in which the mood is created is by showing how caring and selfless the narrator's parents are. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This gave the memoir a light and happy mood, reflecting the positive influence of the parents. A third way in which the mood is created is by showing how friendly everyone was with each other. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The narrator explained how friendly and open everybody in the neighborhood was with one another, contributing to the overall feeling of community. As you can see, the author of the memoir created a largely positive and heartwarming mood in the memoir."
913	12739	5	3	"In the memoir the author's tone is loving. The way he describes his Cuban heritage and culture is full of pride for being Cuban. In @LOCATION1 two he states that he is eternally grateful for having had his parents ""rich culinary skills and a love of cooking"" passed on to him, highlighting a deep appreciation for their influence. Then at the end in @LOCATION1 seven his tone is once again loving and grateful, reflecting on the warmth of his upbringing. In the very last sentence it is noticeable: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" showcasing a profound sense of gratitude and affection for his family and their ability to create a nurturing environment."
914	12740	5	3	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, the mood created by the author is happy. The mood is happy because everyone in the memoir are enjoying their lives and their not worrying about anything. As explained in the memoir, even when @PERSON1 and Rawedia had to start their lives over entirely, they didnt hesitate. Their family were happy, they partied, and as said in paragraph @NUM1, they ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family."" This welcoming nature further contributes to the overall joyful atmosphere. In this memoir Narciso enjoyed his life and looked up to his parents for everything they did for him. In paragraph @NUM2 Narciso exclaimed that he will never forget how his parents turned that simple house into a home, which showed their happiness in this memoir. It's clear that the love and strong family bonds described contribute significantly to the cheerful mood conveyed throughout the memoir."
915	12741	5	3	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" I think the author evokes a mood that is passionate, grateful, and happy. The reason I believe the author is passionate is because he speaks about how a home isn't just a roof over your head; it's where your heart is. ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open for the many people they consider family."" I think that is passionate because in order to do those things, you have to be really caring and lovable. I think that the author shows gratefulness because he says that he always thanks his parents for the sacrifices they made to give him a better life in New Jersey. Even though he says it many times, it just isn't enough to prove how grateful he is. His parents transformed a three-bedroom apartment into a place he now calls home, and that is what he is grateful for. I think that Narciso is happy that he had the chance to spend his childhood growing up in New Jersey, while still embracing the cultural traditions of Cuba. He is now a fashion designer. All in all, those are the three moods that I think Narciso conveys in the story, demonstrating his appreciation and joy for his upbringing and heritage."
916	12742	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Home, the mood created by the **WARM AND LOVING ATMOSPHERE** in the memoir is that growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life. but, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home, fostering a sense of belonging that transcended traditional definitions."
917	12743	5	3	"The author does an excellent job of creating many moods in this memoir. One of the moods is love. Love is a mood in this memoir because @PERSON1's parents took ten people who needed somewhere to stay, because they knew that those people would do the same thing for them. Another example of love is when @PERSON1 says in paragraph @NUM1, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" The memoir also makes one feel very grateful for what they have, which is another mood. It does this by having the author point out how little his house was, and how his parents did everything they could to give them a better life, demonstrating their devotion. It really makes one look back and see how much their parents have done for them, highlighting the power of familial affection and sacrifice. Thus, the memoir successfully evokes love and gratitude through vivid storytelling."
918	12744	5	3	Well first the author feels happy and excited, but he also feels sad because he is moving to @LOCATION1. In 1961 he was born, and in that time he met a friend who was his babysitter, and she was his first friend; she lived upstairs from them. He has a lot of family members, but when he moved to @LOCATION1, his mom and dad took in people that needed a home just until they could get back up on their feet. He wants to see his grandparents who can't leave until 1970, but he told his mom and dad he will always be grateful to them for their love and sacrifice. He often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than he could have ever done; he also often told them of his admiration for their strength and perseverance, and he thanked them for everything they did.
919	12745	5	3	"The mood would be loving and caring. When @CAPS1 was a child growing up in @LOCATION2, his parents treasured family and friends. They taught him to always lend a helping hand and to always keep his door open. ""Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly spanish, cuban, and italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States."" It was a close-knit community and everybody knew everybody. Nobody was a stranger. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" His parent's instilled how important family is, and friends were just as vital, creating a warm and supportive environment for him as he grew. This emphasis on connection and mutual support shaped his worldview and values."
920	12746	5	3	The emotional @INTENSITY created by the author in the memoir is Very necessary. I say this because I don't like any writing that doesn't have @INTENSITY swings. this author does a good job of showing the emotions of Narciso Rodriguez in their story. A place in the story where I really like the @INTENSITY swing is between @SCENE @PARAGRAPH1 and @PARAGRAPH2. I like this change because, it goes from talking about a landlord and his daughter to talking about @DESIGNER's parents. I like that because, it creates a mode of @CONTRASTING different backgrounds on the two different @GROUPS of People. It talks about how @NARCISO's Parents were immigrants and weren't raised well but they wanted their son to have a better childhood life than them. On the other hand, the landlord and his daughter @UPTOWN, were rich and Could do anything they wanted. I am just blown away by how this author changes his moods. Thus, the author's strategic use of contrasting narratives effectively highlights the diverse backgrounds and experiences shaping the characters within the memoir.
921	12747	5	3	"In the memoir 'Narciso Rodriguez' the mood of it was happy and was meant to sorta touch someone. In his memoir he explains something he found fun and amusing that he still does today, highlighting ""a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful), and passionate Cuban music (which I adore today)."" ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity in friendship,"" illustrating a happy and united neighborhood. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language of the culture. They came selflessly,"" indicating he wanted readers to appreciate his parents' caring and loving nature, ultimately shaping his own values and outlook on life."

When living in Newark as a child, Rodriguez lived in a very loving home, and a very loving neighborhood. Rodriguez refers to the people living in his neighborhood as family, claiming ""... 'Family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" He always had neighbors and friends over which he considered to be ""family.""

Narciso explains the true definition of family in this memoir, and thanks his parents for loving him as much as they did, ultimately conveying a deep appreciation for the nurturing environment in which he was raised."
934	12760	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very strong. Narciso's mood mostly has to do with his family, friends, and most importantly his culture. Narciso is very happy and lucky to be born in the United States and have a chance to grow up there. Second Narciso loves his home. He talks about how they created their New Jersey home into a traditional Cuban home, filling it with familiar sights and smells. For example he says that the kitchen is the heart of his home and how his parents taught him how to cook, which he is grateful for. Lastly his mood towards his friends is that he treats them and considers them as his family. For example his landlord's daughter cooked meals for him more often than not, showing the close bond he shared with those around him. Also his ""real"" grandparents which weren't his real grandparents because they were still in Cuba, highlighting the importance of chosen family in his life. Those aspects contribute to the overall joyful and grateful tone the author sets in the memoir."
935	12761	5	3	"The mood in the memoir by @PERSON1 is happy, loving, and upbeat or lively. Happiness is seen by the reader when he is explaining the way many different cultures ""come together in great solidarity and friendship."" @PERSON1 is happy he grew up here and is happy with everything about his childhood in this neighborhood. The author loves everything about this neighborhood, cherishing the sense of community. @PERSON1 especially loves that there are always people around their table and extended family comes to see them, highlighting the importance of kinship. @PERSON1's writing is very lively and he writes with great passion, imbuing his memories with warmth. The fact that the author puts so much happiness, love and life into his memoir is what makes it so interesting to read and what makes the mood so fantastic, creating an engaging and heartwarming experience for the reader."
936	12762	5	3	"In the memoir the mood that was created by the AUTHOR is saying Family is the most important thing in life. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifise."" That means he is saying that he will always love his parents and his family. The AUTHOR is trying to say that it is better to have family than money because in this memoir it talks about his parents leaving Cuba with no money, no job, but for them being together it gave them hope and now they live in a FIVE room house with their family. Without family, life would be much harder to deal with, showcasing how family support and love are invaluable, even more so than material wealth, in navigating life's challenges."
937	12763	5	3	I believe the mood of the memoir is happy and enlightening. I think this because when someone immigrates from a country facing poverty or unjust laws, this community will take you in. This community is made up of Cuban, Spanish, and Italian immigrants; all have left their homelands to pursue a better life for themselves, their families, or their children. In conclusion, the mood of this memoir is happy because it depicts an enlightening and welcoming place to be.
938	12764	5	3	"The author's mood of this memoir is extremely thankful and appreciative. He said he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifices, and mentions what struggles they had, beginning in a one room apartment then affording to move into a three room apartment for him to call home. He explains how his parents started their lives entirely over in @LOCATION1, and needed to take whatever work they could find, from cleaning offices late at night to working long hours in factories. They were able to endure their hard times with the faith that this struggle would help lead themselves and their children into better times. The author had so much admiration of his parents strength and perseverance. He learned the true meaning of 'family"" and about how to love. He was really appreciative for all he had, and the lessons of generosity and how important family & friends are that his courageous parents had taught him, that had also become the basis of his life, shaping his values and influencing his decisions every step of the way. He is forever indebted to their unwavering commitment and the values they instilled in him."
939	12765	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a family mood. Rodriguez talks about how family always visits. The memoir states ""countless extended family members came and went..."" (paragraph @NUM1). He also explains that family isn't always the people related to you, showing a broader sense of belonging. Rodriguez says that his neighborhood ""came together in great solidarity..."" (paragraph @NUM1), suggesting a community acting as a surrogate family. Rodriguez says that he is most grateful for his parents ""for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM3), highlighting the central role of immediate family. Narciso Rodriguez really creates a mood filled with love, caring, and family, emphasizing the importance of these bonds in shaping his life."
940	12766	5	3	"In the HOME from ""Home: The Blueprints of our lives,"" Narciso Rodriguez creates a very distinct mood. I think the mood of the HOME is warm, caring, comforting, and very loving. The author's home is very family oriented, but not to just blood family. His neighborhood was all family when ""Racism was the norm and segrigation prevailed."" When Narciso Rodriguez discribes this the HOME sounds comforting and loving. He says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This brings a happy, light feel to the article and coforting as well. When Rodriguez says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" the mood changes a bit. Now it's admiring, grateful, and compationate. As Narciso Rodriguez discribes his parents Struggle so he could grow up nicer than they did you can feel hes very grateful and loving. The mood is happy, loving, and full of compasion at this point. This is the mood created by the HOME by Narciso Rodriguez from ""Home: The blueprints of our lives,"" ultimately leaving the reader with a sense of appreciation for family and the sacrifices made for loved ones."
941	12767	5	3	In the memoir, the author sets up a happy mood while remembering his childhood home. He only recounts good things and happy memories in the entire memoir, filled with sunshine and laughter. He also speaks of cherished childhood memories, like building forts in the woods behind his house and the annual summer picnics. He remembers how good his community was, a place where neighbors helped neighbors and everyone knew your name, and how wonderful his parents were, always supportive and loving. These recollections paint a picture of an idyllic upbringing, concluding with a profound sense of gratitude for the solid foundation it provided.
942	12768	5	3	The mood in the story is very happy. The author is thinking about all the good times he had growing up. He is talking about how he had such a good life in the house. How his parents came there as immigrants and made a life for themselves and then him. Another reason he has a happy mood is because he talks about his family coming to @LOCATION1, their new home. He talks about how his parents taught him how to cook traditional meals. He thanked his parents because he was so happy they created a family, full of love and memories, not just a home.
943	12769	5	3	"And throughout the memoir there is a constant mood, which is happiness. In the beginning of the memoir, @PERSON1 describes his home, about how it started to how it became a wonderful ""home"". He said it had ""a passionate Cuban music"" and ""amazing aromas of cooking"", which clearly shows his joyful memories. Then in paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON1 says that ""he loves his parents for their love and sacrifice""; and he continues saying how grateful he is toward them for providing him with such a loving environment. Lastly in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This feeling of appreciation and warmth solidifies the overall mood expressed in the memoir."
944	12770	5	3	"In the memoir the author creates many moods within it. In the text the first mood he created was caring because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows caring because they would let anyone that was family stay with them and wouldn't hesitate to help. The next mood he showed is being grateful because in paragraph @NUM2 he says"" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"". This is him showing that he is grateful because he explicitly states his gratitude and also explains the basis for his thankfulness towards them. These are the moods the memoir created, demonstrating the author's ability to evoke specific emotions through his writing."
945	12771	5	3	"I think in my opinion is that the author was very comfortable with his words and his way of being human. His parents were originally from Cuba, he @CAPS1 was into their culture and nice to others in their surrounding. For an example, he @CAPS2 says, ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to the country and where I celebrated his first birthday."" This suggests a deeply ingrained sense of hospitality and cultural pride, contributing to his comfortable and humane persona."
946	12772	5	3	The author makes a mood like no other in this memoir. He creates a mood in which enstills gratitude and praise for his parents. He tries to express his gratitude to his parents in words but can't because of all the great times. He makes a mood of happiness that will last forever in his memories and the kitchen, solidifying the importance of family and shared experiences.
947	12773	5	3	"I think the mood of this story is warm and loving. Narciso's Parents never had a big home in the United States but they turned a small house into a home. In a @NUM1 bedroom, two family house in @LOCATION1's parents created a traditional Cuban home. A lot of cooking happened in the house. Family was always around, which must've been fun, and all of this happening with Cuban music playing in the background. ""@CAPS1 the air, mixing with aromas of the kitchen. Narciso makes his home seem like a very loving home, full of the sights, sounds, and smells of Cuban culture."
948	12774	5	3	"The protagonist in the story is happy. This is because he got to move to the United States and be born here for a better life. He also loved growing up here with the Cuban traditions and music as stated on paragraph three ""And for what I am eternally grateful,"" which I adore to this day. It is clear that his upbringing significantly contributed to his joy and appreciation for his heritage."
949	12775	5	3	In this memoir, Narciso made the mood peaceful because he named the music that was playing and all the family that ate with them. Narciso also talked about them cooking. I think the mood's peaceful because he doesn't say anything bad about his parents; he only says the good things about them. The mood could also be grateful because he was grateful for many things that his parents did for him such as pass down the love of culinary. He's also grateful for his parents leaving Cuba and starting everything over again so that he could have a good job and a good life. Another possible mood can be warmth because Narciso loved his family and probably felt the warmth of everyone when they all went over his house, creating a sense of comfort and love. This appreciation for his family and their sacrifices ultimately contributes to the overall warm and grateful tone of the memoir.
950	12776	5	3	"The mood created by the narrator in the memoir was gratitude towards his parents. In the memoir, the narrator thanks his parents for raising him the way they did. In the article, he thanks them by saying things like ""my admiration,"" ""my gratitude,"" and ""generosity,"" illustrating his deep appreciation. All these statements are true and they reflect his mood towards his family. In conclusion, the mood was a lot of things, but I choose gratitude because it reflects how he feels about his family the most."
951	12777	5	3	Narciso was so proud he was a Cuban immigrante, and he often spoke of how his parents did so much for him. He realized that, as detailed in paragraph @NUM1, family had nothing to do with being blood relatives. He also understood how all cultures came together, creating great solidarity and friendship, especially considering when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United @ORGANIZATION1. He learned the true meaning of family, appreciating how his parents turned a regular house into a home that he loved. He was eternally grateful for how his parents made so many sacrifices that transformed ordinary moments into a lifetime experience he would never forget. He was happy how the little things turned into great memories that he couldn't wait to share with the world, forever cherishing the profound impact of family and cultural unity.
952	12778	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is one of happiness, safety, and care. Narciso had parents who loved him and a very close-knit community. All the descriptions of his family cooking and family neighbors eating together is enough to make anyone feel happy. Throughout the memoir, Narciso emphasizes the care of his parents. You know Narciso's parents loved him as of his attitude toward them. In paragraph @NUM1, when he writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" shows his parents' care for him. Further emphasizing this loving environment, he often speaks fondly of simple moments spent together. When the author writes, ""In our neighborhood,... all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" These two sentences give the reader feelings of safety and once again emphasize care.

The reader also gets the feeling that everybody is loving and friendly, especially as the author talks about how immigrants from different places came together and were great friends. He also says his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"". @PERSON1 paints a picture of a home filled with love and acceptance. There was also a lot of life at his house. ""Endless celebrations [...] formed the backdrop to life in our warm house.""

955	12781	5	3	"In the memoir, the author creates a sort of grateful, appreciative mood. Throughout the memoir, Narciso repeats how grateful he is to have such courageous parents.

They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This clearly shows how grateful he is for his parents and their immense sacrifice, just to give him a better life and more opportunities. I would feel just as grateful for my parents if they had done this for myself, just as how Narciso felt, understanding the weight of their decision and the love behind it."
956	12782	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir are love, happiness, and unity.

Unity is one of the moods because everyone in the neighborhood got along. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" These elements of love, happiness, and unity demonstrate the strong sense of community and familial bonds that the author cherishes, shaping the overall positive and heartwarming tone of the memoir."
957	12783	5	3	The mood created by the memoir is exciting because he likes fashion design and the story revolves around clothing design. He also feels happy because he likes the home and has turned a simple house into home, creating a space he cherishes.

Finally, unity was shown a great deal in his community because they were mostly all Cuban, Spanish, or Italian immigrants, and they tended to stick together, offering each other support and a sense of belonging in a new land.

959	12785	5	3	The mood created by the author was happy, The love Of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. I will always be greatful to my parent, for their love and sacrifice.

When @PERSON1 talks about his parents and how they ""always kept their arms and their door open"" that sets a loving mood because if one is so generous and caring to do that, it means they love you and they care about you. This openness suggests a home filled with acceptance and affection. Also at the end of the memoir Narciso says that he ""learned there about how to love"". @PERSON1 now says this about his house because his parents were always so up beat and caring that they showed him what love is. Being loved makes all people feel good inside, and it is this feeling that permeates his recollections of home, establishing the memoir's overall loving and comforting tone."
961	12787	5	3	The mood of the author in the memoir is grateful and thankful. Narciso's life seems original, unlike others might have experienced. It was a simple house they started with, which his parents transformed into a warm home. Narciso appreciated that his parents brought them to this land, Cuba, selflessly caring for their children to provide a better life. Although they were struggling, they still had happiness. His parents often welcomed neighbors and relatives to join them for meals. Family, to him, was not just his parents, sisters, and brothers; it also included the neighbors who surrounded you and treated you with respect like family. This is how Narciso Rodriguez felt worthy to have a home like that. He felt grateful and thankful for his parents' love and sacrifice. He admired his parents' strength and perseverance.

963	12789	5	3	The mood in this story @PERSON1. Moving can be hard for some people others it is an @CAPS1 adventure. Most people hate to leave their @CAPS2 homes, work, and friends behind. Other people it's a new oppertunitie to meet new people a better job, or go to a better @CAPS2 school for your education. I understand it is hard to move from cuba to the united States. Thats across the world not a town over or a street down. But he made a friend and his mom and dad love him very much. They always have food on the table so at lest they dont starve. It was a step down moving to united States going from a good jobs to poopy ones.

This story was great; it talks about a @CAPS3 and his parents moving to the United States, making it a heartwarming narrative.
967	12793	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and warm. This is shown in two ways: the selflessness of the parents and the true meaning of family.

This is shown in paragraph one when he explains that his parents loved Cuba but left so their children could have a better life in America. He gives his thanks to his parents in paragraph two, acknowledging the sacrifices they made. This feeling of gratefulness contributes to the warm, happy feel of the piece.

968	12794	5	3	"I think the mood is supposed to be sad for many reasons. One reason is that he keeps saying how his house isn't a home until the end, showing a sense of longing. Such as, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" highlighting the importance of family in creating that feeling. Another reason is that his friends and family are all he has, representing a strong reliance on them for support. Such as, ""...how important family and friends are,"" emphasizing their significance in his life. Also, because he had to move, he didn't know anybody, causing feelings of isolation. Such as, ""Originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956,"" perhaps suggesting the challenges of adapting to a new place and the sadness of leaving behind what was familiar. Therefore, the recurring themes of a house not being a home, the value of close relationships, and the displacement from his origins all contribute to an overall melancholic tone."

In paragraph 3 and 4, the author says that, ""all of these cultures come together in great solidarity and friendship."" The author also says, ""My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" These quotes show that friendliness and helpfulness to the people around you considered family is a big part of their lives and the author trys to convey this sense or mood to the reader. The mood is thankful because the author is appreciating all that his parents have done for him. In paragraphs 5 and June 10, the author mentions being grateful of the cooking Skills passed onto him and ""to his parents for their love and sacrifice.""

Lastly, The mood is one of caring and welcome to friends and neighbors they considered family. In paragraph 4, the memoir States that ""Alegria"" and the author's ""surrogate grandparents"", ""graced our Kitchen table for meals more often than not."" These quotes show the openess and caring feeling in the home and family created by the mood of the story. This family kept their ""door open"" because they cared about ""countless"" people around them, establishing a heartwarming and welcoming atmosphere."
975	12801	5	3	"The mood of this article created by Narciso Rodriguez in ""The blueprints of our lives"" is selflessness, admiration, gratitude, and thankfulness.

He remembers the innocence of childhood, the frequent congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that marked their lives.

I know the author is thankful for his parents because in paragraph @NUM1, the author says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.""

978	12804	5	3	In the memoir *Narciso Rodriguez* by *The Blueprints of our Lives*, the mood the author created is grateful. The author created that mood because he was and is still grateful about how his parents left behind their family, friends, and jobs so that he could have a better life. Also, the mood is grateful because they passed on their rich culinary skills to him. He is also grateful for living in a simple house with all those wonderful neighbors and friends. I think the mood created by the author is grateful because this is a memoir reflecting on the good things in his life and all of the blessings he feels fortunate to have received.
979	12805	5	3	In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he creates a happy and excited mood. This is because he is sharing family memories and those of his home. He is happy about them because of all of the good times he had in it. One event he was fond of at his house was his babysitter and first friend Alegria. Narciso shares times he’s spent with Alegria and in doing so shows a mood of happiness. When the author talks about the kitchen and the Cuban music it brings an excited mood to my head. I imagine some exotic food cooking with a sweet warm smell and parents talking over the passionate Cuban Music. Narciso Rodriguez's life seems to be one that is very interesting and exciting, filled with warmth and fond memories, as reflected in his storytelling. I wonder what he's doing now.
980	12806	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways. For one, the mood is of graciousness for all that was done for Narciso Rodriguez. In the memoir it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This feeling of graciousness tells about the love and sacrifice he feels his parents went through for him. The memoir also shows this mood of graciousness for the understandings his parents taught him, shaping his worldview. In the memoir it says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This understanding that was taught to him had a large impact on his life at that time. The final expression of graciousness in the memoir is his feelings toward the passions his parents taught him. In the memoir it says, ""unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally thankful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air,"". These express the passions and skills that followed the author to adulthood, holding a special place in his heart. Therefore, the author's pervasive sense of gratitude significantly shapes the overall tone and emotional impact of the memoir."
981	12807	5	3	"The overall mood created by the author in the memoir was courage, and perseverance. First, Narciso Rodriguez's parents traveled to the United States with absolutely nothing; they had no money or background information about the country. In paragraph 1, Narciso states, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" Narciso's parents would bravely step into a new world where they didn't know anyone, they couldn't communicate with anyone, and they didn't really have any ideas as to what was going on. The Rodriguez's also persevered through the constant challenges of racism and segregation, here in this country. In paragraph 2, he states, ""at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed..."" Consequently, Narciso's parents had to get through problems with people, and they also had to fight through the mental challenges, due to racism. Lastly, in paragraph 1, Narciso says that his parents were always ""braving the harsh winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" His parents had the courage to persevere through new weather and financial struggles. The overall moods that Narciso Rodriguez created for me were bravery and perseverance."
982	12808	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was the mood that you don't have to have lots of money or a big house; you just have to have your family to support each other. This feeling is evident through their shared experiences and unwavering loyalty, highlighting the strength found in familial bonds rather than material possessions, ultimately showing that love and support are what truly matter.
983	12809	5	3	"The author's mood in this memoir is happiness, stemming from the strong sense of family he experienced growing up. He states that being raised in that environment fostered a feeling of familial connection, noting that ""here in my house felt like Cuba."" The author's happiness is further emphasized by the respect he and his whole family showed to each other and to others, ultimately contributing to his positive outlook."
984	12810	5	3	"A sense of community, selflessness, and contentment washes over Narciso Rodriguez's memoir of his first home. Happiness was prevalent over this story, described through a ""love of cooking"", ""endless celebrations"", and ""friendship"". Readers can imagine the scenes depicted, happy gatherings around a table laden with aromatic food, and parties with people, young and old, tall and short, of all different cultures. The words that weave this well-written memoir are nothing if not content.  Community is also emphasized in this written work. ""A close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants"", their neighborhood was described as. The memory of many souls working together despite radical racism in that time really gives the memoir a communal sense. Narciso Rodriguez says, ""My parents always kept their arms and the door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The open-door policy fostered a shared sense of belonging and mutual support.  When the sacrifices that his parents made were outlined in the memoir, selflessness truly becomes a mood in the memoir. A whole new life embraced just so that their children could have a better life, his parents rarely did things for their own benefit. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" Narciso Rodriguez says. The endless struggles they endured, and the many times they could have given op, they didn't, because they wanted, so selflessly, to give Narciso a better life. This memoir's mood holds three important things: a love of community, happiness, and selflessness, creating a powerful and moving narrative."
985	12811	5	3	The memoir evokes a range of moods, reflecting the diverse experiences recounted. The author shares stories of family and friends, detailing how they transformed an apartment into a cherished home. Cultural traditions and joyful pastimes with loved ones are also explored. Interspersed with these cheerful moments are instances of sadness, poignantly illustrated by the author's late introduction to his paternal grandparents, who were finally permitted to leave Cuba in 1970, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1; this delayed connection clearly adds a layer of complexity and bittersweet emotion to the narrative, ultimately demonstrating the full spectrum of human experience.
986	12812	5	3	"In this memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the Soundtrack of Our Lives created a mood that was calming and the author was passionate in what he said and made a happy mood. ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" This quote shows that the mood was cheerful and calm. The mood the author created was the friendliness of family and friendship between the family and how other people would join them into his family house. The author made the mood like an instilled environment as like he was growing up in ""this environment instilled in me a great sense of ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This feeling contributed to the overall welcoming and warm atmosphere the author sought to create. Ultimately, the memoir's mood reflects the author's gratitude and affection for his upbringing."
987	12813	5	3	"While reading Narciso Rodriguez I felt a certain mood. the mood was very serious and grateful. In the memoir Narciso said, ""I will always be thankful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" this shows he is thankful for all his parents Did to make him the man he is today. He also writes, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" That statement is a serious thought that clearly came from the heart. It shows he has love for anyone who comes close to him. To add, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage."" that says that he thinks about his parents and having heart, and courage, and that is both serousness and gratefulness. This reflection on his parents' journey highlights his deep respect for their bravery and the sacrifices they made. In closing I would like to say Narciso Rodriguez is a very grateful and serious man."
988	12814	5	3	The mood created by the author is that of the American Dream. It is a very happy and successful theme with roots in the hearts of millions of immigrants that hopefully had similar stories. In each paragraph there are lines that have a relation with friends being family and how his home was physically quaint but emotionally it was a place of love. That enhances the mood of happiness in the story. Also, the fact that in the story racism and segregation were set aside and neighbors were relatives because of who they were not where they came from, is significant. That is what everyone loves to hear and makes the mood hopeful that the whole nation will act like that. Lastly, the story tells of times how the parents sacrifice for their sons' better life. That has probably touched most of the readers close to home so the mood would now become very serious, adding depth. This short memoir is a great story to bring your mood from sad to hopeful and thankful that you live in a place you can call home.
989	12815	5	3	"In the excerpt from the memoir ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" by Narciso Rodriguez he has a specific mood or feeling throughout the whole excerpt. His mood seemed to be kind of like a happy mood that shows everything, even the hard times like ""a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed the United States,"" in a happy tone or mood. He even explained how his parents left their country and friends to live here and have worse jobs in a lighter, happier mood. Rodriguez also recounts his childhood memories of his close-knit Cuban-American community with a sense of warmth. I believe that Narciso Rodriguez likes to look at everything in a happy, light mood no matter what it is, suggesting a resilient and optimistic perspective on life's experiences."
990	12816	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and a loving one. A reason why I think this is by talking about how he and his neighbors (of different descent) all got along very well in solidarity with one another, sharing stories and helping each other out, which creates a sense of love and community. Also, when he talks about happy times, like when he and his family are cooking in the kitchen, preparing traditional dishes and sharing recipes, they are having a good time, laughing, and listening to Cuban Music, filling the house with warmth and joy. Lastly, when he and his family take in family, or even just really close friends who they consider family, offering them a place to stay and sharing what little they have, conveys a true sense of happiness, peace, and love that permeates their home, ultimately solidifying the memoir's heartwarming tone.
991	12817	5	3	"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives"" is compassion. Throughout the memoir it talks about how Narciso was grateful to his parents for their ""love and sacrifice"". He was grateful that they wanted to move to the United States from Cuba just to ensure that he would have a better life. He learned generosity and how important family and friends are from his parents and they have been ""the basis"" of his life. His house welcomed everyone and the air was always filled with ""not just scent and music but life and love,"" creating a nurturing environment. He learned what family really meant and learned how to love, shaping his understanding of human connection. He loved his parents a lot and talked highly of them in his memoir ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love... The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" This deep appreciation and understanding of his parents' sacrifices paints a picture of compassion that permeates the narrative. That is why I think that the mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives"" is compassion."
992	12818	5	3	"The author of this memoir creates a mood that is very touching and meaningful. It shows the hardships his family had to overcome as well as the good that came from it all.

He explains how hard it was for his parents to leave their home and jobs in Cuba, but that they did it for him, so he would get to live a better life. One more thing the author said in the memoir that was very touching was when he said, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me..."" These words show us how much of an impact his parents' actions had on him and how they helped him in life. These examples illustrate the touching mood the author successfully conveys."

He tells us how they called the people to celebrate when they came to **America** for the first time. But he doesn't only tell us what good times he had; he also told us how hard it was for him to live in Cuba, showcasing a complex blend of fondness and hardship that ultimately shapes the nostalgic feeling.
996	12822	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the story has more of a ""happy"" or ""joyful"" mood.

Two, he said how happy he was for his unselfish parents and their sacrifices for him to pursue his dreams, ""I was always grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"". Finally, he explains how different everyone was, and yet could get along with each other so well, highlighting the sense of community, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.""

His Parents have their arms and doors open to those who will do the same for them, highlighting their reciprocal nature and deep appreciation for human connection, thus solidifying the overarching feeling of gratitude in the memoir.

I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and those teachings have been the base of my life."" This quote clearly demonstrates the author's deep appreciation. In my conclusion this is why I think the author's mood in the story is very thankful and grateful."
999	12825	5	3	"There are many ways to describe the mood in ""Home: The @CAPS1 prints of Our Lives"", by Narciso Rodriguez. First, the mood is family-friendly.

The story radiates happiness as they all want to be together and be a happy family. They are telling you where the parents are from and when they moved here, further emphasizing their journey. There is a lot of love in their family, which is a central theme. The parents turned a simple house into a warm and loving home, reflecting the strong bonds and affection within the family.
1001	12827	5	3	I think the mood of the author in the memoir is thankful, proud, and happy. @PERSON1 is extremely thankful for what he has, despite what has happened throughout his life and the struggles he faced. He is proud of his Cuban heritage and is still proud of it today, embracing his roots. He listens to Cuban Music and cooks Cuban food, keeping the culture alive. Also, he is happy; in the memoir, he has a very happy tone because he is proud and thankful for his journey.

Also I think this because it talks about good memories which is always a happy thing, recalling pleasant moments and experiences. And it's all celebrations and being together which is always a good thing, fostering a sense of warmth and connection. Therefore, the descriptions of lively gatherings and cherished recollections strongly suggest a happy and positive atmosphere.
1004	12830	5	3	"In this memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain mood. I believe that the mood is supposed to be seen as joyful and uplifting. The whole memoir is describing what a rich childhood the author had; from his home itself to all his family, he had nothing but great things to say. When talking about his home, he says ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful)."" I would say that is pretty enlightening. He also mentions the strong sense of family unity and the constant support he received, further emphasizing the positive atmosphere of his upbringing. He also says how grateful he is for his parents and the values they instilled in him. The mood of this memoir is nothing but good, painting a picture of a happy and fulfilling early life."
1005	12831	5	3	"In the memoir written by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso shows a certain love and passion toward his family and culture. The mood of this memoir would be love and passion because of the words and emphasis on his feelings. For instance, in paragraph three it states that family does not mean just blood relations. Narciso talked about how all sorts of cultures came together as one and were always good friends along the way. Another way mood is expressed is through his foreshadowing, showing Narciso kept the tradition going. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today"" and ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" Narciso expresses his foreshadowing in two ways, by adding parentheses and just stating it, highlighting the lasting impact of his upbringing. A third example of the mood in this memoir is the way Narciso talked about the love for his family, and how important being thankful is. ""I have always told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Narciso also states Narciso can't thank his parents enough, and if they taught him none of that Narciso would not be who Narciso is as a person today. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Just adding the love and culture to one's house can turn it into a caring home! The memoir's mood is effectively shaped by Rodriguez's palpable love and gratitude, underscoring the profound impact of family and cultural heritage on his identity."
1006	12832	5	3	"Narciso was very grateful for his parents; they had love, happiness, and maybe even depression in their lives. The author's memoir was sad, but also a loving one. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house; within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" Narciso loved his parents for making a simple house into a traditional Cuban home. He also loved how his parents made their own home with hard work and dedication. ""My mother and father had to come to this country with such courage; they came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" Narciso was so grateful he thanked his parents every day for the love they created and the sacrifices they made. ""It was this simple house that my parents celebrated my first birthday."" He kept the house as a memoir to remind himself of his humble beginnings and how he came to America. The house represented a life that was loving, caring, and cheerful, a testament to his parent's unwavering spirit."
1007	12833	5	3	"The author of the story creates a mood to help really emphasize the point of his story.

Rodriguez also explains how he learned to call his neighbors family as the Italian, Cuban, and Spanish cultures ""came together in great solidarity and friendship."" Furthermore, he tells of how the door was always open and their newfound family was always seated around the table. Rodriguez really does a fantastic job of creating a pleasant mood in this memoir."
1008	12834	5	3	"In this memoir written by fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain tone conveyed by his writing about his childhood home. Many people who immigrate from a poorer country like Cuba are quite poor when living here because like Narciso says in the bottom of paragraph @NUM1, ""In the United States, [my parents] had to start their lifes over entirely, taking what ever work they could find."" @CAPS1 Instead of talking about the hardships, Narciso focused on the fact that he was raised into a wonderfly cultural enviorment. An enviorment filled with his ""family"". When he says family he doesn't meen just her biological family. He means all the people that he spends time with and has a deep connection with. Therefore, the mood that Narciso Rodriguez is conveying in this memoir is a warm, greatful, and happy tone. A tone that shows that he will never forget all the things his parents gave up so that he could have a good childhood. The tone also shows that now, even though he is a famous fashion designer and most likely is quite wealthy, he will never forget how his parents ""turned the simple house into a home."" This is what the tone of this memoir is, a reflection of deep appreciation for his roots and the love that shaped him."
1009	12835	5	3	"The mood of the author is happy. The mood is happy because they doesn't really mention any negative thoughts or feelings at all. He mentions throughout the story, how he is so grateful for his family, like his mom and dad, expressing a deep sense of appreciation for their presence in his life. He talks about himself being cuban, and how proud he is to be Cuban, indicating a strong sense of cultural identity and belonging. The narrator has a bunch of good thoughts, about his mother and father, further reinforcing the positive and joyful tone of the narrative. He mentioned in the story ""I will alway be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" showcasing his profound thankfulness. He always tells his parents of how proud he is of them, and mentions how their basically an example. This consistent expression of gratitude and pride solidifies the author's happy and appreciative mood throughout the story."
1010	12836	5	3	The mood of the author in the memoir is that the author was there and lived there so, the mood was really so, the author was happy. Happy that the authors parents gave him a chance and also gave them freedom to start over for there son. Ultimately, this happiness underscores a deep sense of gratitude for the sacrifices made on his behalf.
1011	12837	5	3	The mood in the memoir shifts throughout the story. First, in the beginning, Narciso wasn't sure he would like moving to @LOCATION1 because it was so different. But that changed when they started having family over and also using their imagination to decorate their house, making it feel more like home. Next, the mood changes in the middle of the memoir when they realized you can have just as good a life in @LOCATION1 as you can anywhere else. Also, them having their family with them while in @LOCATION1 made their moods more positive and strengthened their bond. Lastly, the family's mood was negative when having to move to @LOCATION1, but once they were there and made their house into a home, their mood changed immediately, and they were happy in @LOCATION1. That's the mood created by the author in the memoir, showcasing a journey from apprehension to contentment.
1012	12838	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very specific mood. He talks about family, love, and home. For example, Narciso says that the heart of his home was the kitchen, and there was always passionate Cuban music playing. In his neighborhood, Narciso says that ""cultures came together"" and that his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This generosity extended to everyone they knew. I can tell how important friends and family are to Narciso and his family and how welcoming and caring they are. Narciso believes that his home was filled with ""not just scent and music, but life and love."" I believe the mood of his house was not only obvious to Narciso, but to his neighbors and family too, fostering a strong sense of community and belonging."
1013	12839	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a very calm and grateful mood from beginning to end in his memoir. First of all, he describes the selflessness of his parents. Narciso explains that ""they had to start their lives over entirely"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) when they left Cuba for the United States. He understands that they only left for his benefit, and he appreciates that sacrifice. Also, Narciso is thankful that although his parents moved to the United States, they kept their Cuban traditions alive. In Narciso's three room apartment, ""Passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2), creating a comforting atmosphere for him. Lastly, Narciso expresses his appreciation, and strengthens the mood by defining what a home is. He claims that he ""will never forget how [his] parents turned the simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3), emphasizing the love and effort they invested. For these reasons, Narciso is grateful, and his appreciation creates a calm, inviting, and grateful mood throughout his narrative."
1014	12840	5	3	"The author created a warm, loving mood throughout the memoir. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocense of childhood, the congregation of family and friends,... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This quote represents a warm mood because he talks about what he loves, such as Cuban music, and how friendship and family really come together to form his life growing up. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This quote clearly represents a loving mood throughout the memoir because, like the first quote, it represents friendship and family, but also represents love and caring between all members of his childhood community, showing the reader that the community cares for each other, and they are all loving of each other. The mood changed near the end as well. It turned into totally love and warmth, but also happiness. ""It was a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) this shows happiness because even though they are poor when they arrive in @LOCATION1, they are still celebrating the possibilities that are facing them. This consistent portrayal of love, warmth, and happiness creates a compelling and heartwarming narrative."
1015	12841	5	3	"In the memoir, by Narciso Rodriguez, a distinct mood of family and caring is set. The first way this mood is set is by the the passionate Cuban music and the home cooked meals. Rodriguez writes, ""passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (p. @NUM1). This quote accentuates the mood of family because the music and food of their nationality gives a feeling of comfort. The comfort with your family adds to the mood of family. Another way the mood of family is portrayed is the size of the house. Rodriguez writes,""... I was born in this simple house situated in a two family, blonde-brick building..."" (p. @NUM2). This adds to the mood of family because living in a small house means that a lot of the time will be spent with family. This also adds a cozy feel to the environment, fostering closeness. Finally, the mood of family is contributed to by how close their family lives. Rodriguez writes, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria and Rosemary also live nearby"" (p. @NUM2). Family living nearby contributes to the mood of family because it accentuates the number of family members, which amplifies the feeling of familial connection. Based on the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a strong mood of family is expressed through these interwoven details of culture, home, and proximity."
1016	12842	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. It is happy because she said growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative. This is saying that she is happy for what she has in her life, appreciating the bonds she formed. She is saying that she has a nice family, friends, and a good home, finding contentment in her chosen connections. Ultimately, she conveys a sense of joy and gratitude for the non-traditional family she has built."
1017	12843	5	3	The author of this memoir creates a very calm mood. This article isn't all that exciting at all. All it is doing is explaining this child's life. This memoir, to me, was like taking a list of things and putting them into a full paper. The author did not create any kind of mood that interested me to keep reading of this topic. This memoir did however express a lot of feelings though. It expressed how grateful this kid was for his parents and his Cuban descent. Although this memoir had a calm (and slightly boring) mood, the author's ability to reveal information was very deep and insightful, making it a revealing, if not thrilling, read.
1018	12844	5	3	"One mood of this memoir was that of a traditional Cuban home. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM1, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban Music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" A second mood of this memoir was the impression of a Cuban family who faced many hardships. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM2 ""They Struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" The last mood gives me the impression of what a real family is about: love, loyalty and friendship, ultimately showing their resilience. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM3 ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" demonstrating how these values helped them overcome adversity."
1019	12845	5	3	The mood by the author in the memoir is touching because it feels like a memory story. This story is telling you how to be memorized by the story, and it makes you cry a little bit. I kind of like it a little bit because it's about Cuban people. I think my father knows people from Cuba, and I think he knows their culture, which makes the story more relatable and impactful.
1020	12846	5	3	"The mood of the @CAPS1 memoir is happy. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez describes the happy and fun times of living in her small home in New Jersey. He describes how his family, which consisted of her mother and father turned their @CAPS2 modest house into a cuban home and opened the doors to other refugees that were going through difficult times. In the last @CAPS4 section Narciso explains that this is the home where all her first birthdays happened, and where her friends and family would gather. The message the @CAPS1 memoir was trying to get across is that it doesn't matter how big or expensive a home is, it matters who is in the home that makes it a special place to be. The reason I know the @CAPS3 memoir's mood was happy is because, she had wonderful people in her life. Her home wasn't big and fancy but as described in @CAPS4 section @NUM1 ""It was a simple house that my parents opened to other refugees."" In this @CAPS5 description he is saying that his home was full of happiness and love. Narciso's once simple house had turned into a home, filled with friends and family, showing that love and connection create true happiness."
1021	12847	5	3	"In the memoir I think the mood the author creates is love for family. In paragraph Rodriguez explains that family has nothing to do with being a ""blood"" relative. He means that you don't have to be related to someone to consider them family. In paragraph 5, Narciso says that so many extended family members come in and out of his house all the time and they are always treated lovingly. I think that the fact that Rodriguez's parents brought in so many people to their home is inspiring because it really does show the love and warmth the family has to bring in refugees from places other than america, plus their family! It is this open-door policy and acceptance of others that truly exemplifies the author's central idea about the expansive nature of family, ultimately showcasing a deep and abiding love that extends far beyond traditional blood ties."
1022	12848	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is welcoming and cheerful. One example that describes this is from paragraph NUM1. This is where he described his neighborhood, saying ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" With this he meant that no matter what background their neighbors were from, they always welcomed each other. Also, in paragraph NUM2, the author says that his parents came to LOCATION1 selflessly, to let their child have a better life even though they were leaving their home country and everything familiar to them. Lastly, in paragraph NUM3, Rodriguez describes the warm memories of his home, where he had birthdays, parties, and family gatherings. He said that there was the scent of life and love in the air, creating a sense of belonging and happiness. For this he is forever grateful to his parents because he learned the true meaning of ""family,"" and their sacrifices shaped him into the person he is today."
1023	12849	5	3	The mood of the memoir is nostalgic and happiness. He tells the readers about his economic backgrounds, sharing details that paint a picture of his upbringing. He also explains about his family and what they meant to him, revealing the deep bonds they shared. Then, he talks about his house and about how he had his birthday there, recalling the joy of those celebrations. These are some examples on how they create the mood, fostering a sense of warmth and fondness in the reader.
1024	12850	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he is proud of his family, their background, and the way he grew up. In the memoir, it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This statement alone reflects a deep appreciation for his upbringing. Narciso loves his parents and the way they raised him, suggesting a positive and affectionate relationship that shaped his values and identity. This love and respect ultimately contribute to his overall sense of pride and contentment with his family's story."
1025	12851	5	3	The mood in this story is very happy. In this answer I will show how he created it. Firstly, the author always had a good mood no matter what happened or what his parents didn't do. He focused on the positive aspects, like the comforting and great memories of the kitchen smelling good with his mother's cooking. He also loved his Cuban music, which further contributed to his cheerful disposition. Secondly, he showed how thankful he was towards his family for bringing him into this world and caring for him. These two things show how Narciso Rodriguez made this a happy passage to read and contribute to the overall optimistic tone.
1026	12852	5	3	The author of this memoir created many moods. One mood that was felt is happiness because of the way Narciso Rodriguez described his home to be a place of childhood innocence, family, friends, and endless celebrations. Another mood is gratitude for I have never given up my friends, family, and home and Narciso Rodriguez's parents had to give up their friends, family, and home in Cuba to support Narciso. The last mood is admiration at the fact that Narciso Rodriguez and his friends and family could feel so happy even though racism and segregation were a part of the world, along with the fact that they were going through financial trouble. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez made the readers feel many moods while telling his inspirational story, ultimately leaving a lasting impression of resilience and hope.
1027	12853	5	3	I think the mood in this story was mostly happy and grateful. Because he loved living there with his parents and having family members around and being able to learn about his heritage and traditions. And learn about all the cooking, which was a central part of their culture. He seems to have had a very nice childhood and has always thanked his parents for that. They gave up everything to go to America to raise him and provide opportunities, and he seems very grateful for their sacrifices and the loving environment they created. All of these elements contribute to an overall feeling of happiness and appreciation for his upbringing.
1028	12854	5	3	"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, she uses key terms and phrases to discuss the mood; in paragraph @NUM1 she says, ""Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This line puts a clear picture in your head of what it would be like to have lived in that home. Another time Narciso Rodriguez puts a clear picture of the setting in your head is in paragraph @NUM2. She is stating where her parents must live and says, ""braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics."" This line puts the setting in my mind, which makes it more clear to picture the home and setting. Narciso does a great job describing the mood of each location, truly allowing the reader to visualize the environments she depicts."
1029	12855	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is that of gratefulness and happiness. The memoir show a pasionate explination of how Narciso Rodriguez's parents Came to the land of @LOCATION1, the United States. It shows how happy he is that he can live in the United States, and lead his own life. He is, and will always be, eternally grateful that his parents brought him here, so he could have a better life. His gratefulness also affects how his parents raised him, as a Cuban-American, instilling in him the values of hard work and perseverance. Any mood could have been described here, but, as it states in the memoir, he is grateful for his family, and the opportunities afforded to him because of their courageous journey.
1030	12856	5	3	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author's vocabulary and sentence construction evoke a strong sense of love, happiness, and appreciation for his home and community. The harmony and friendship within his neighborhood, despite differing nationalities, is highlighted, a contrast to the times: ""In our neighborhood... all of these culture came together in Solidarity and friendship"". His word choice, with repeated use of words like love, grateful, and self-less, strengthens this atmosphere: ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"". ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The thoughtfully crafted and retrospective composition, vividly describing a place so near and dear, further reinforces the mood of underlying gratitude and love, demonstrating the profound impact his upbringing had on shaping his values."
1031	12857	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from home: the blueprints of our lives, the mood created is described in many ways. To start off with, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that FAMILY had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Quite the contrary, his neighborhood was made up mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the NEW JERSEY streets. Narciso will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. Narciso've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than Narciso could have ever done. It was here where Narciso learned the real definition of ""family"". Narciso will never forget his house and his gracious neighborhood, and Narciso will never forget how his parents turned this simple house into a home, illustrating the profound impact of love and community."
1032	12858	5	3	In this article I am given information about this main character's life and his caring parents. The author's mood in this article is grateful, happy, and amazed. The author is so grateful that his parents would do such a brave, courageous thing for him. It makes him amazed that his parents would do that for him to live a great, happy life. The author will never be able to show all of his appreciation towards his parents, for they did a great thing for him, sacrificing so much to ensure his well-being and future happiness, and that is something he will always remember.
1033	12859	5	3	In the story of Narciso Rodriguez, the person telling the story, @CAPS1, is grateful to their parents for moving so that they could have a better life. The people that were around them were like their family, even though they weren't blood-related @CAPS2. The parents weren't selfish; they helped if people needed help and let people stay if they needed a place to stay. The parents moved to make a better life for their family, even if it meant leaving everything behind, demonstrating their selfless dedication.
1034	12860	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is caring and loving. The author explains, throughout the memoir, how his parents were caring and loved to help others. He says that his parents ""always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family"". He explains how his parents had left their great jobs, friends, and family in Cuba, so that their children would have a better life. The author says that his parents helped him discover the real meaning of family, revealing their sacrifices and open-heartedness as the foundation of his understanding."
1035	12861	5	3	So the mood of this memoir is **Melancholy**, Struggle or not so good and **Hopeful**. In the **beginning** it telling you all about His parent and alot more about His parent's. Next is talk about Being born in a simple house and that way **Melancholy** mood there to. So **near** the end of the memoire **he** startes to talk about the **hard** things like not Be able to find the kind or jod they deserved and that not that much **hard** thing **he** talk But But in the end **he** **understood** the definition of **Family** and that mood is alsome. Then **he** learne there about love in the simple house and to never forgot how my Parents turned the simple house to a home. So the mood is a mix of **Melancholy**, **hard** time's and the alsomeness and more, showing how even amidst struggles, family and love can create a sense of home and hope.
1036	12862	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is that they feel more responsible to help support themself more than anyone else does as they grew up from young to old, and they have been living independently from their families. I think the author's mood is that they feel good about themself and happy to have a better life now compared to the past, learning more about themself as their mood becomes happy and joyful about having achieved a better life. This self-reliance fosters a sense of accomplishment and pride.
1037	12863	5	3	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created by the author is appreciative. Narciso Rodriguez is deeply thankful of his parents and other friends and family for helping him through his life. Narciso Rodriguez repeats several times throughout the memoir the appreciation he has for his parents, family, and friends. In paragraph @NUM1, it quotes, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage... They came selflessly..."" This describes how he respects his parents so much for their sacrifice. Paragraph @NUM2 states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age."" In this quote, Narciso Rodriguez thanks his parents for loving him and their sacrifice. Then, he gives appreciation to the caringness he had during his childhood, which includes his neighbors, friends, and family. Narciso Rodriguez is appreciative of his family, especially his parents, for the generosity for the betterness of his life. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is gratitude and appreciation for his parents generosity, care, selflessness, and sacrifice, painting a portrait of a life shaped by profound familial love and support."
1038	12864	5	3	The mood the author created in the memoir was happy and joyful. The author explains where he lived as a child very vividly, from the air mixed with the aromas of Cuban food to the Cuban music the author still loves today. It seems like he had a good childhood, full of sensory experiences he cherishes. He says his parents were selfless and took in refugees in their home, offering them a safe haven. It gives this story a warm feel, like it could almost be your mom or dad telling it. He makes the story very personal with all the family members he explains, painting a picture of their lives and personalities. His parents did the very best they could for their family, creating a loving and supportive environment. That dedication and warmth is how the mood is set, leaving the reader with a feeling of happiness and nostalgia.
1039	12865	5	3	In the memoir what was the mood created by the author. First, I feel that the mood created by the author is both happy and sad. I feel that they are sad because they moved from Cuba to @LOCATION1 where they left all of their friends and family and careers they loved behind. They also struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. Although they were sad I also felt that they were happy. I thought this because even though they moved from the place they loved they have one thing that made them feel at home. I think that it was there home and each other because they have there home Just as they like like, like when they were back home. I felt that the mood was both happy and sad in this memoir.  In the memoir, the author crafts a mood that is both happy and sad. The sadness stems from their relocation from Cuba to @LOCATION1, a move that necessitated leaving behind cherished friends, beloved family, and established careers. The narrative conveys the personal and financial struggles endured, including confronting the unfamiliar and unforgiving northern winters while longing for the warmth of their native tropics, and navigating the complexities of cultural assimilation. Yet, amidst this sadness, a sense of happiness also permeates the text. This happiness, I believe, derives from the enduring presence of elements that remind them of home. Their home and their connection to each other serve as anchors, allowing them to recreate a sense of familiarity and comfort reminiscent of their life in Cuba. Ultimately, the memoir evokes a complex emotional landscape, where happiness and sadness coexist.
1040	12866	5	3	"I think the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is that he is proud and grateful. One way he shows he is grateful is by telling the readers how his parents sacrificed themselves to give him a better life. He says: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Which shows that in addition to being grateful to them for sacrificing themselves, he is grateful for all the love and care they gave to him as he grew up. Narciso Rodriguez shows he is proud by saying ""my Mother and father had come to this country with such courageÖ I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done"". This shows Narciso Rodriguez is proud to have parents that are strong and brave and willing to leave ""behind their families, friends, and careers, and the country they loved"" all for him, demonstrating his deep admiration for their strength. So I hope you now see how Narciso Rodriguez's memoir creates a mood that reflects how he is proud of and grateful to his parents."
1041	12867	5	3	"The mood that was created by the author was love and inspiration. The mood was love because throughout the whole story he told his parents that he loved them and was proud of them, expressing deep affection. He feels proud of them because of all they do for him and the family, showcasing his admiration for their efforts. So he is proud of them. He is also grateful to have parents like this because they do so much for him; they cook, clean, and keep a roof over his head and keep him protected, providing a secure and nurturing environment. The other mood that is created for me is inspiration; this mood is created because of what he says, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance,"" which highlights their admirable qualities. This means that he is proud of his parents, and he is thankful for what they do for him; he says that he is thankful for all they have sacrificed, acknowledging their selfless actions. These are some examples of the mood that was created, ultimately leaving the reader with a feeling of warmth and encouragement."
1042	12868	5	3	The mood created by the author is love and nostalgia. Because the author talks about how growing up was. The author helps babysitting. And the author sounds like a nice person; these details evoke feelings of warmth and a fondness for the past, thus creating a mood of love and nostalgia.
1043	12869	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there are various different moods. The main mood is thankful. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez expresses a thankful mood. In paragraph @NUM1, there is an example of this thankfulness: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (Rodriguez, paragraph @NUM1). This proves how Narciso acknowledges the sacrifice of his parents, and thanks them for it. He understands the immensity of their decision and the hardships they faced. In paragraph @NUM3, Narciso states that, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" (paragraph @NUM3). This proves how Narciso Rodriguez thanks his parents for what they did for him. He recognizes the depth of their commitment to his well-being. In conclusion, in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a thankful mood, highlighting his deep appreciation for his parents' sacrifices and unwavering love."
1044	12870	5	3	The first paragraph was happy because they came to the CAPSA.S.A and after living there for a year, was happy. In 1961 he was born while they were living in the simple house, situated in a two-family blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark. He was unhappy because they and another family shared the same kitchen.
1045	12871	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy mood, that's sort of calming. The author explains how the house was very comfortable for him. Narsico explains how his parents were caring and selfless all the time, and this contributes to the overall soothing tone. I think that creates a very calming and caring mood. Also in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" which again creates a caring mood, highlighting the author's appreciation and solidifying the memoir's comforting atmosphere. Thus, the combined effect of a comfortable home and loving parents cultivates a serene and heartwarming mood throughout the memoir."
1046	12872	5	3	The mood the author created is gratefulness. I am grateful for many things. I'm grateful for the culinary skills and love of cooking that was passed on from my parents. I am grateful for my close-knit community, who are honest hard-working immigrants who always extend a helping hand. But the big reason I am grateful is my family. I am grateful for my countless family & extended family who join us for meals and who stay with us temporarily. I am also mostly grateful for my parents. I am grateful that my parents are so nice and always keep their arms & door open for help, knowing they'll do the same. I am also majorly grateful for their courage to come to a new world without knowing any of the language or culture just to give their children a better life. I am grateful my parents had to make a huge sacrifice just for my benefit to leave behind their friends, family & careers in the country they love. I am also grateful for both the personal & financial struggles my parents had to go through and braving the harsh northern winters. For my culinary upbringing, love of food, family, and my parents' sacrifices, I will be forever grateful.
1047	12873	5	3	"This memoir really sets of a mood of love and comfort. It does this when he tells us that his parents immigrated just for him, showing their immense dedication. Then it keeps that mood going when he tells us about all the people that come over regularly for dinner, highlighting a sense of community. His parents loved him and made a great environment for him; like he said, they ""made a house a home,"" creating a space filled with warmth."
1048	12874	5	3	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author was powerful. It had made one feel as though you were actually there. The author had explained in detail his living environment of a small house in a community of other immigrants like themselves who had banded together in rough times. During the memoir the author tells about his Cuban background, ""Passionate Cuban Music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" Rodriguez also tells about Rodriguez's definition of family: the ones in his community that weren't just blood-related, but the neighbors who looked after each other. The author sets the mood of love for his culture and his family within their community, and how his simple three-room apartment has become a home. This depiction of a close-knit immigrant community evokes a sense of warmth and belonging."
1049	12875	5	3	Throughout the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates many different moods. As a reader, I experienced a variety of emotions, such as sorrow for the family and what they endured, pity for the children who witnessed their parents' struggles, yet simultaneously benefited from observing their resilience. It instilled strength in them. Though throughout the memoir, among all of the other moods that are portrayed, there is the mood of eternal gratefulness. The parents' sacrifices for their children's better lives and promising futures are truly remarkable, exceeding the bounds of simple description. No words can adequately express the amazing nature of those parents and what they did for their children. This deep appreciation, along with the other affecting moods, is vividly portrayed in this memoir, leaving a lasting impression of the family's journey.
1050	12876	5	3	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is that of a happy mood. The memoir is about a Cuban family who want to live in America to give their son a better life. Their parents gave up their jobs of being scientists for their son, showing the depth of their affection. The story is in a good because their is true love being spread. Narciso Rodriguez lived in a happy mood, surrounded by the warmth of his family's dedication, creating a positive atmosphere overall."
1051	12877	5	3	"The mood of this story was a happy and a reflective one. Many times during the story, especially in paragraph @NUM1, he told us what his parents did, but also after almost every sentence in parentheses he would say how much it meant to him. For example, he says how his parents cooked, and after that: (and for which I am eternally grateful). This shows how much he loved his parents for passing on their culinary skills. In one paragraph, he starts off the sentence with: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This again shows the mood of gratefulness, happiness, and reflectiveness from the story, ultimately shaping a heartwarming narrative about family and appreciation."
1052	12878	5	3	"The mood that the author created throughout the course of the memoir was a sense of happiness but also family. This family moved from Cuba to @LOCATION1 with no clue what to expect, no prior knowledge of the culture or anything else. All they had was each other, which gives off a great sense of family unity and reliance. Then there is the happiness factor; throughout the story, no matter what the circumstances, they seem to be happy because they had family. In the story, it says that ""my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This lets me know that he does view his house as a home, and that means he is happy and feels secure within its walls, illustrating the strong bond they shared as a family."
1053	12879	5	3	"The mood in the memoir changes, but overall the mood is sad. It tells how Narciso's parents give up what they had for the better of their children. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their Children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" This sacrifice creates a feeling of melancholy, knowing the personal cost of their decision. Also, most of Narciso's family did not have homes for a while which is sad because they do not have a place to call home. ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This constant flux and instability contribute to the somber tone. Narciso's parents gave up everything for him to have a better life. They left the place they were most comfortable in for him. ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" Despite the underlying sadness, there is a glimmer of hope, suggesting that their sacrifices were fueled by the belief in a brighter future. The overall effect is a poignant narrative of sacrifice and resilience in the face of adversity."
1054	12880	5	3	There is a Cuban family. The father came to the country in 1956 seeking a good future for his family. He has an apartment with two rooms. He has two sons: one is a boy who is twenty-one, and the other is a boy who is twenty-seven. These details paint a picture of a Cuban immigrant family striving for a better life.
1055	12881	5	3	"In the memoir the author creates a mood that is calm and comfortable. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" that shows that his house is without no yelling or fighting. Also, in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed backdrop to life in our warm home"" that shows while he grew up his home was comfortable for him. In paragraph @NUM3 it says ""the kitchen in this humble house where a @LOCATION1 feast always filled the air but life and love that showing that his family was calm and loved each other. The author says in paragraph @NUM3 ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home"" that shows he was comfortable growing up in his house even though he didn't have lots of things. He emphasizes the emotional warmth over material wealth, highlighting the secure environment fostered by his parents. In conclusion, the author creats a mood for the memoir that emphasizes peace and contentment."
1056	12882	5	3	"In this memoir the author creates a mood which- for me, sucked me into this memoir. I think Narciso Rodriguez created a ""home sweet home"" mood. I say this because when he says, ""within it walls, my young parents created our tradition cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen,"" it reminds me of my family and how my family loves cooking puerto rican food. The smell is like, ""your home"". In my home everyone's accepted and even if you're not related. Narciso also says this in his memoir, conveying a sense of warmth and inclusion that resonates deeply. Also, Narciso is very grateful in his memoir because his parents immigrated to have a better life, and this creates a loving and family mood. Narciso says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many thing I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Now that they've immigrated, Narciso Rodriguez will never forget his childhood home, and it is this deep appreciation that helps foster the overall heartwarming mood of the memoir. There are many moods in this memoir, but the pervasive sense of gratitude and familial love is ultimately what makes it so compelling."
1057	12883	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the mood is kind of happy, sad and is greatful. Narciso is very happy because he usually gets to spend time with ""family"" and is also very happy that his family hes with him and that more family will come from cuba in a few years. He is sad because he cant see his grandfather and because his parents didn't get to live such a great life as him. He is greatful for being alive, for his parents doing everything for him bringing him to @LOCATION1, and he's greatful because he got to live such a great life because of his parents' sacrifices. That blend of happiness, sadness, and gratitude truly encapsulates the emotional core of the memoir."
1058	12884	5	3	The mood the author Narciso Rodriguez creates in this memoir is a very appreciative and thankful tone. In this memoir, he is expressing how thankful he is for his parents moving to America to give him a better life. He shows appreciation to them for their selfless and brave deeds, especially considering the sacrifices they made. At one point in this memoir he says to his parents that what they did was a much more courageous thing than he could have ever done. He tells his parents this to let them know how brave he thinks they are, ultimately highlighting the profound impact of their decision on his life.
1059	12885	5	3	His mood was happiness. Being with his family, sharing moments, being gathered with your family around the table, having great times with your family members playing games, taking chances with your family on new ventures, explore the world together, never be afraid to go somewhere new as a unit, express your feelings to each other openly, always be there for each other through thick and thin, being yourself without pretense, don't change and take risks to a different state, experiencing new cultures together. Don't be afraid to share with one another your vulnerabilities and always be there for one another offering support, and always be yourself, express yourself how you want to be and don't change for anybody, embracing individuality within the family unit, and that is what truly brought him happiness.
1060	12886	5	3	The mood created by the author, in my opinion, is a happy mood. It is happy because the author gives the reader a great explanation and description of his life at home, highlighting the warmth and security he felt. The author created a happy mood also because it showed that his parents were not selfish and that they wanted their children to have a better life in the United States, a decision rooted in love despite the sacrifice of leaving their whole family behind. Also, Narciso talks about how he and the rest of the immigrants had to deal with racism, facing adversity with resilience. But, they were still happy and determined to be, so they all work together happily and in unity, supporting one another through shared experiences. I think it shows that the author not only had family in a nice house, but in the neighborhood as well, fostering a strong sense of community. The story gave me a sense of a really good, close-knit family, emphasizing the bonds and support they offered each other. Including the importance of one, which ultimately contributes to the overall positive and uplifting feeling conveyed by the author.
1061	12887	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is pride. I think that the mood created by the author is pride because in paragraph two it says ""...culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" I think it's an example of pride because it says ""for which I am eternally grateful,"" showing that he will always be proud of Cuban food and his heritage. Another reason why I think the mood is pride is in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" I also think that is an example of pride because it shows that he was raised with Cuban music, a vital part of his culture, and he still loves to listen to it, showcasing a deep-seated pride in his upbringing. Therefore, the author's consistent appreciation and gratitude strongly suggest a mood of pride permeating the memoir."
1062	12888	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is very uplifting. The story is mostly about how much the author appreciates his family and what his parents have done for him. It also shows how happy the family was and how everyone around them were family regardless of where they immigrated from. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""Family had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" highlighting the strong bonds they formed with neighbors and friends. This sense of community clearly contributed to the overall joyous atmosphere depicted in the memoir, emphasizing the profound impact of chosen family."
1063	12889	5	3	"The author created several different moods in this memoir. The main mood that the author was trying to creat was thankfulness. In paragraph @NUM1 it says,"" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows thankfulness because she's saying thank you to her parents and everything they have done for her. Also, she is thankful because she started to realize how hard her mom and dad had to work for the house and put food on the table. This growing understanding contributes to the overarching feeling of gratitude. The main mood of the story is clearly thankfulness."
1064	12890	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is love and appreciation. Narciso appreciated all that his parents did for him, their sacrifices a testament to their devotion. They gave up a home in Cuba for him, their job and even happiness. Love because they all loved each other alot; family meant alot to the family. They said family is people who care for one another even if they are not blood related. It doesnt matter. It's about Love and careness, a bond that transcends mere genetics and focuses on genuine affection and support. Ultimately, the memoir celebrates the profound impact of familial love and the gratitude owed to those who selflessly prioritize the well-being of their loved ones.
1065	12891	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is nostalgic, warm, and thankful.

In paragraph three the author says: ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This sentence also makes the reader feel nostalgic and warm because the author really gives the reader a sense of his childhood community's unity and love. In paragraph five the author says: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" In this sentence the author really conveys his sense of thanks of his parents to the reader as he praises them. In paragraph six the author says: ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important Family and Friends are."" And later in paragraph seven: ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'Family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" These excerpts really sum up the author's thankfulness about family.

In the first paragraph he says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" Here he shows his compassion for his parents because his parents left cuba and went to America to start a new life. Also, they wanted a better education for their children so they left family, friends, everything behind so they could restart their life. Another way how Narciso shows love to his parent is by using what his parents did to him into his life. Narciso used the better education, to have a better life that they sought for him.

He describes how all immigrants left their country just to give their children better lives. Narciso describes how his parents had great jobs in Cuba, gave those up, and took any jobs they could find in @LOCATION1. In paragraph six he says how he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. Also in that paragraph he says there is no way to express the gratitude he feels towards his parents. The last sentence of that paragraph he says ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" There once again he is thanking his parents for their guidance. Throughout the memoir he describes his parents like heroes and thanks them for everything they did for him, showing his profound appreciation, which clearly establishes the overall mood of the memoir."
1092	12918	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir is very loving and caring and it shows appreciation to the author's parents. The author (@ORGANIZATION1) explains how it was for him as a kid and his ""family"" doesn't always mean a blood relative. He describes the household as being very humble and always had open arms and welcomed others. He also says that it wasn't about the size of the home or how expensive it was, it was about the people inside it and how close they were and the memories they shared, further emphasizing the importance of their bonds. All in all through this memoir @PERSON1 (the author) shows that he is very appreciative of his family and wouldn't change how we grew up and thanks his ""family"" for impressing the spirit of generosity upon him in an early age, highlighting the profound impact of their values on his life."
1093	12919	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author depicts a mood with distinct traits. One trait of the mood is selflessness and courage. It is shown in paragraph @NUM1 when the author says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" Would you be able to throw away your life, into an alien world, just so that your children would have a better future? Doing this would take lots of selflessness and courage. Also, the mood has gratefulness. The author shows this in paragraph @NUM2 when he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows the author's gratefulness towards his parents for their selflessness and courage for coming over to @LOCATION2 to give him a better future. Finally, unity is found in the mood. It is found in paragraph @NUM3 when it says, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures come together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close- knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows great unity in their neighborhood because in other parts of the United States, these three races didn't get along, but in this neighborhood they were unified, supporting each other through shared experiences. In conclusion, the author depicts a mood with distinct traits, highlighting the powerful emotions and communal spirit that shaped his upbringing."
1094	12920	5	3	"The author created a very positive and optimistic mood in the memoir. He talked about how his fascinating Cuban culture was portrayed throughout his home. The author said, ""passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This quote shows his love and pride for his culture. In the memoir, the author also tells about his extreme thankfulness towards his parents. He admired their courage. Narciso felt that his parents did all they could to give their family a good life and that they were successful. Narciso said, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows that he has a genuine appreciation for what they did. He believed that family is everyone that you love and are close to, not just blood relatives. Narciso considered his community to be one giant family, emphasizing the strong bonds he felt. This memoir had an upbeat tone due to the positivity and optimism of the author, leaving the reader with a sense of warmth and hope."
1095	12921	5	3	The mood created by the writing in the memoir initially felt rushed, hindering the development of the character. The pacing fluctuated erratically, making it seem like the writer struggled to control the narrative. The mood felt like a frantic rush followed by a forced slowdown, and this inconsistency could deter readers. While the story potentially held promise, the uneven pacing may have been a drawback. As a reader, not a writer, I observed the story followed a predictable arc, with initial struggles before improvement. A slower, more descriptive approach could have set it apart. In the first few minutes, the predictable plot almost led to abandoning the story. Ultimately, the writer should be mindful of pacing and reader expectations to avoid alienating the audience; better choices in writing and story selection are needed to cater to diverse tastes.
1096	12922	5	3	In the memoir the mood was happy and loving because when they had their house their families would be welcomed in and strangers also would be welcome in. His parents were very loving because they were always so kind to people and they would rarely get into arguments. And the family was so enthusiastic and happy just because their family was together, cherishing every moment spent in each other's company and creating lasting memories within their home.
1097	12923	5	3	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, it explains how your house can affect you as a child and when you grow up. The mood of this memoir to me is comforting. I think this because when the memoir said that he had plenty of relatives around, and friends that probably made him feel comfortable. His close-knit community likely provided a sense of security. Also his parents were very welcoming and kind so you would probably feel comfortable because of that too. Their warmth would naturally create a safe and supportive environment. That is what I think the mood of the memoir is and why I feel its comforting tone stems from the secure and loving atmosphere Rodriguez describes.
1098	12924	5	3	"In the memoir, the author created the mood that made it had a close relationship. The author made the relationship very close from everywhere. In paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The author gave the happiness to the cultures they have settled with the author, giving them friendship and happiness. The author also described their friendship with their neighbors. In paragraph @NUM2, he wrote, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The author thinks it his family consider other families as part of their family, then the other families will consider the author's family as part of their family, illustrating a reciprocal bond built on mutual generosity. Families have been always close to each other. The authors said he will never forget his own family. He wrote in paragraph @NUM3, ""I will never forget that home or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love."" The author shows that his close relationships of his neighborhood and all his friendships were deeply impactful, shaping his understanding of affection and connection. The author created a close relationship mood while he was writing his memoir, effectively conveying the warmth and significance of these bonds."
1099	12925	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was to show how happy it was for Narciso Rodriguez growing up. ""here, The innocence of childhood, The congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back drop to life in our warm home"" and when the author says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" as you can see the mood of the story is warm and tells us about how he had a good childhood. This is illustrated through descriptions of a loving home filled with gatherings and a sense of belonging that extended beyond biological ties, highlighting the positive influence of his early years."
1100	12926	5	3	"In the memoir there is more the one mood, but this is the main one. First, the author is trying to create a ""no place like home"" mood, and the author succeeds at it. It seems he/she is using memory and telling his/her background, drawing the reader into a sense of familiarity and warmth. The mood was also very calm and very relaxing for the story. Therefore, the author evokes a sense of peaceful reflection. In conclusion this is the mood the author is giving, establishing a comforting atmosphere through the recollection of personal history."
1101	12927	5	3	"I the exerpt Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives There is a specific mood set on the exerpt I think its love and @CAPS1. for example in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my birthdays.""  ACCEPTANCE. for example in paragraph one it says ""I was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my birthdays, feeling safe and secure."" Through shared experiences and celebrations, a sense of belonging was fostered, showcasing the inclusive nature of his upbringing, solidifying the feeling of acceptance."
1102	12928	5	3	In the memoir the mood created by the author I think was more of a serious, informative, and uplifting mood. The reason for why I think this is that the way his lifestyle is described reflects a happy and enjoyable life while also being able to talk about some serious topics like the nuances of his culture and the diversity of the cultures of the people that live on the street. This balance allows for an engaging read. Also, the author's comfort level with all the people that are in his apartment building and all the people that come to his house for dinner, his willingness to call them family, contribute to the uplifting feeling. Ultimately, these factors combine to create a memoir that is both thought-provoking and positive.
1103	12929	5	3	"The author creates a very warm, happy, welcoming feeling by describing how friends and family are always visiting and how happy the family is all the time. The author, Narciso Rodriguez, never mentions any bad times and shows how kind everyone is. This quote from the memoir proves that Narciso is creating a good mood throughout the story: ""The innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote, with its emphasis on ""innocence,"" ""congregation,"" and ""celebrations,"" very well illustrates how the author crafts a consistently positive and uplifting mood in his memoir, painting a picture of idyllic family life."
1104	12930	5	3	"@PERSON1's parents came from Cuba into @LOCATION1, where they were not wealthy and many racial barriers stop them from getting good jobs. However, @PERSON1, who is writing the memoir, explain how they sacrificed it all so that @CAPS1 could have a better life and how much they help their neighbors and their family. Rodriguez writes a lot about how they always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family. @CAPS1 emphasizes this mood, a mood of ""good @CAPS2"" and a neighborly love, how they treated everyone as family. The mood @CAPS1 creates is that where you find the good in a life where there might not be too much good, underscoring resilience and the enduring power of human connection in the face of adversity."
1105	12931	5	3	The mood created by the author in the story was both loving and grateful. This was the mood of the story because the author mentioned how his home was filled with a lot of love & how he is grateful for the sacrifice that his parents made for him. This gratitude stems from the sacrifices they made (sacrifice). In his community that was filled with hardworking immigrants came together in great solidarity & friendship. This bond was a testament to their shared struggles (struggles). The author's parents had come to the country with courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture which he will always be grateful for. This courage shaped his own perspective (perspective). His home was always filled with life & love. The author said that he would never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things he learned there about how to love. He would never forget how his parents turned that simple house into a home, solidifying his appreciation for their efforts and the warmth they provided.
1106	12932	5	3	The mood in the memoir was in a way sad. The reason why it was kind of sad is how they came into this country with nothing. They had to live in a one-bedroom apartment. Even though that was a struggle, they still made it up to being able to make money and improve their circumstances. They got a better living style too, showing their resilience and determination to overcome hardship.
1107	12933	5	3	It seems kind of happy and sad, mostly happiness. They were sad because they had to leave everything behind in Cuba, their home, their friends, and familiar surroundings.
1108	12934	5	3	The mood in the passage is HOPEFUL. It is OPTIMISTIC because they can give their child a better life. Next is because Cuba is not a good place to be in, with limited opportunities. They are OPTIMISTIC because they get to start a new life over. Another reason is they can get better jobs over here, leading to financial stability. They get to live in a BIGGER house then SMALL. They are OPTIMISTIC so they can also help other refugees, offering support and guidance. Finally they are OPTIMISTIC for other refugees; they celebrate their arrival to the country. This creates a sense of community and shared hope for the future.
1109	12935	5	3	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood could be a lot of things. The mood created by the author in the memoir is a GRATEFUL mood. first of all I know this because in paragraph NUM1 it said ""... and for wich I am eternally grateful."" also it said ""wich I adore to this Day."" How I know that those where a GRATEFUL moode because if I where to say that it be GRATEFUL, also there was nothing saying that NARCISO disliked it. Second of all, NARCISO would all ways tell his Parents that ""I will always be grateful to my Parents fo thier love and sacrifice."" also told them ""I've often told them of admiration for their strenth and Perseverance. There for the wood of the memoir is those two reasons why it is a GRATEFUL mood that the author created. And so, the overall feeling conveyed through Rodriguez's words points to a deep sense of thankfulness."
1110	12936	5	3	"There are many ways to describe the mood of the memoir. One way I could describe the memoir is that it makes you feel good about things. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""I will always be grateful for my parents' love and sacrifice."" The mood the memoir sets is a warm mood. I know this because in paragraph @NUM2 it says that his houses were where he learned the real definition of family. This evokes a sense of comfort and belonging. As you can see, there are many ways to describe the mood of the memoir, but ultimately, it leaves the reader with a positive feeling."
1111	12937	5	3	In the @ORGANIZATION1 amemorie, Narciso was born in 1961 into a simple house. A cuban home filled with traditions, and the very heart of which was the kitchen. His parents who loved to cook are still with him today and for which I am eternally grateful. Passionate music which he adores today filled their home. His neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants like his family. His mother and father had come to this country with such courage without any knowledge of the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh Northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. His mood shows lots of positive things about his family, being proud of what he is and what he stands for, having Cuban blood; he seems very pleased with his family’s success and the sacrifices they made to achieve it.
1112	12938	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, by Narciso Rodriguez the author creates a calm and loving mood. The author first shows a loving mood when he says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture... to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This shows a loving mood because the parents wanted to give their children a better life by moving to America, even though they were leaving a lot behind and facing immense challenges. The author shows a calm mood when he says the home ""always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"""". This quote puts a calm mood because when you think of filling the air with scents and playing nice music it puts you in a calm, relaxed mood. This quote also shows a loving mood as well. This is because it explains his love for his family and that he is proud to call his family a family. All in all the above evidence sets the memoir's mood as loving and caring, effectively portraying the warmth and security of Rodriguez's upbringing."
1113	12939	5	3	The author created a mood in the memoir. The mood in the memoir is share with someone even if you don't want to, highlighting a sense of vulnerability and perhaps even a reluctant openness. This feeling is pervasive throughout the narrative, suggesting a struggle between the desire for privacy and the inherent human need for connection, ultimately revealing that sharing, even when unwanted, can be a powerful, albeit uncomfortable, experience.
1114	12940	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives, The mood of the author created is Grateful, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" Narciso says in paragraph @NUM1 first sentence, acknowledging the foundation they provided for his life and career. This appreciation underscores the profound impact of their unwavering support and the opportunities that arose from their dedication. The author's expression of gratitude paints a picture of a strong familial bond. He recognizes the significant role their sacrifices played in shaping his journey. This reinforces the idea that the author's accomplishments are rooted in the love and support he received, ultimately adding depth to his narrative."
1115	12941	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is very warm, happy and inviting. Since the whole story portrays this mood, I will tell you some reasons why. In paragraph @NUM1, Rodriguez tells you how everybody in his neighborhood were good friends and would always give a hand to people in need. Paragraph @NUM2 goes into more detail about paragraph @NUM1, telling us how many of Rodriguez's neighbors, friends and relatives joined him and his family at dinner on a regular basis. His parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This openness created a joyful atmosphere. In paragraph @NUM4, Rodriguez states how his parents selflessly came over to the @CAPS1.S.A to give him a better life. They give up everything they had just so he could have more than his parents did. This just goes to show how much Rodriguez's parents cared for him. As you can see, this is why the mood of the memoir is warm, happy, and inviting, filled with genuine love and selfless acts that create a heartwarming experience for the reader."
1116	12942	5	3	I believe the author's mood was serouse. The gravity of the situation, as described, suggests a somber and thoughtful reflection on the events unfolding. The careful choice of words and the deliberate pace of the narrative further reinforce this impression of seriousness, indicating a deep engagement with the subject matter and a commitment to portraying it with appropriate weight. The absence of levity or humor points towards a focused and earnest approach, solidifying the understanding that the author is indeed conveying a serious message. The concluding remarks, marked by a sense of resolution, ultimately confirm the pervading seriousness throughout the piece.
1117	12943	5	3	"The mood the author creates in this memoir is gratitude. The author is very grateful to his parents for all that they have sacrificed for him. For example, they came to the United States from Cuba, without a clue of its customs or language. The authors parent's left behind their careers, their families and friends, just that they can have a better life for their baby. The author's parents even let people stay in their home so that they could get back on their feet. The authors gratitude is clearly shown in paragraph six when he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author clearly states that he is grateful for all that his parents have given him, including the opportunities they created. The author also says that he thinks that what his parents did for him was the ""most courageous thing [that he] could have ever done,"" further emphasizing the depth of his appreciation."
1118	12944	5	3	The mood in this memoir was happiness. It was happiness because he talks about how much his parents care not only about their family but also friends, showing their generosity and warmth. This created a positive and joyful atmosphere throughout his childhood memories. The overall feeling conveyed is one of contentment and appreciation.
1119	12945	5	3	In the memoir, the author emphasized a very specific mood. She greatly emphasized warmth and safety. By warmth, she meant that you were always surrounded by loved ones. It meant something you'll always remember, because it's such a remarkable feeling. By stressing this warmth, it meant that it created memories that would last a lifetime. The other part of this mood was safety. The explanation of the safety was that you're surrounded by people that care about you, and there's no one to judge you, no one to hurt you, and you're safe from any dangers lurking outside. I personally love the mood of this story because it's something I long for each summer down the cape. In conclusion, the mood of the memoir is very clear and evokes a strong sense of nostalgia.
1120	12946	5	3	"In the short story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood of the short story is grateful and reasonable. In the story a man named Narciso Rodriguez twenty-seven years old migrated from Cuba in 1956 with his parents to come to the United States. When they came they had to live in a one bedroom apt. they could afford nothing else. But Narciso was being very greatful. Even though they had nowhere to to work in places with bigger pay. So they only had little pay to feed there family. Narciso is greatful in paragraph @NUM1. They struggle both personally and finanacially braving the harsh northern winters. Narciso had to settle for what was given to him at the time. His acceptance and appreciation for their new life, despite the hardships, highlights the grateful and reasonable tone prevalent throughout the narrative."
1121	12947	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is the idea of sacrifice and generosity. @PERSON1's parents came to @LOCATION1 as immigrants from Cuba and by doing this took a very risky and difficult journey in order to make @PERSON1 have a more successful life. The parents gave up seeing their families, friends, and established careers in the country they loved, enduring hardship for their child's future. Narciso displays generosity by saying ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" highlighting the profound impact of their selfless actions. Ultimately, it showcases the profound impact parental sacrifice can have."
1122	12948	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso @CAPS1"" by the Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood was happiness because he had his heritage, family and freinds, and the chance to make new lives in @LOCATION2. In paragraph @NUM1 it States ""Skills and love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate cuban music"". This quote is releavant because it shows that @PERSON2 is happy of his heritage, cherishing the traditions that have shaped him. In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Family and freinds, and celebrations that encompassed them both."" This quote is relevant to my question because it shows that freinds and family made Narciso happy, providing a strong support system during a time of transition. In paragraph @NUM3 it States ""In the United States they had to start over entirely taking whatever jobs they can find."" This quote is releavant to my question because it shows that Narciso's family can make whatever they want out of their lives, despite the challenges of adapting to a new country. That is the mood in the memoir ""@PERSON2 @CAPS1"" by Blueprints of Our Lives, showcasing resilience and joy amidst change."
1123	12949	5	3	"The mood created by the author's memoir is one of LOVE and Sacrifice. He often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than he could have ever done, deeply moved by their unwavering commitment. As he was growing up, his environment instilled in him a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative, but rather a bond forged in shared experiences and mutual support. He often told them of his admiration for their strength and perseverance, and he thanked them repeatedly for the lessons they taught him. As he says, ""he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a sanctuary built on affection and selflessness. This profound appreciation underscores the overarching themes of love and sacrifice that permeate the narrative."
1124	12950	5	3	The @COURAGE created by the @IMMIGRANTS in @AMERICA like in @TESTIMONIAL @2024 it sAys that My Mother And My fAther hAd to come to this country with Such courAge, without Any knowledge of the lAnguAge or the culture they cAme selflessly, As MAny immigrants do, to give their children A better life, even though it Meant leaving behind their families, friends, And careers in the country they loved. Their selfless act demonstrates the immigrant spirit.
1125	12951	5	3	"The mood that was created by the author was respect. For example it told the boy that you don't have to be a blood relative. For instance, the author states ""@CAPS1 up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"". Another reason, was that you should always help your family during bad times. For example the book reads ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet"". This highlights the importance of supporting one another through hardship. Thirdly, the boy will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. For instance the author quotes ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Ultimately, the overarching mood of respect stems from appreciating familial bonds, acts of kindness, and the sacrifices made for loved ones."
1126	12952	5	3	"The mood in this memoir I think would be happiness because his parents gave him happiness by being there all the homieness. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows how much they've done for him and he has appreciated their unwavering support. Overall this is recognizing that family and happiness are unified, demonstrating a deep appreciation for the positive impact of his upbringing."
1127	12953	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the story, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", was sad. This is so because he's always talking about how he doesn't know parts of his real family and, seemingly isolated, he lives in an apartment. This sense of disconnection and lack of familial knowledge definitely contributes to the overall melancholic feeling. Thus, the narrative evokes a sense of sadness linked to his personal history."
1128	12954	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Home,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, has a very strong and touching mood. In paragraph two, Rodriguez states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This line describes the mood as extremely loving and touching because he is showing how much love he dedicates to his parents for the life he lived. Also, in paragraph four, Rodriguez states ""... there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This line also describes the mood as very calm and loving because he is extremely grateful for the life his parents gave him. In paragraph seven, the last sentence really describes the mood because he is now showing the love to his parents and to his house where grew up, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This memoir describes the mood as extremely loving and grateful, highlighting the profound impact of family and upbringing on Rodriguez's life."
1129	12955	5	3	"The mood created by the author is fairly formal, with a few informal parts. For example a formal paragraph, like paragraph number one, sets the stage of the whole memoir and uses formal transitions like ""After [living]"". Also, the paragraph is very informative, telling about his parents immigrating to the @ORGANIZATION1 from Cuba and how they were financially poor + could not afford a fancy home like they could in Cuba. An informal paragraph in the memoir is a paragraph like number six where he is describing how thankful he is for his parents being as selfless and giving as they are. He also uses informal transitions such as ""But, [in reality]."" And ""these...,"". It also just has an informal tone to that paragraph, reflecting a more personal and heartfelt expression. As a conclusion these parts of the memoir have a good balance of formal + informal settings to keep the reader engaged, by blending objective narration with subjective reflection."
1130	12956	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" there was a mood to the memoir. The mood that was set was about how you should keep peace in the house. You should be grateful and appreciative to what your parents do for you and what they give you, understanding the sacrifices they make. Another mood that was set is to keep your house open to family and friends, creating a welcoming atmosphere. And hope they would do the same for you, fostering a sense of community. And no matter if you're poor or have a small house ""family"" is always there, offering unwavering support. And family ""can turn a simple house into a home,"" filling it with love and belonging, ultimately making it a sanctuary."
1131	12957	5	3	"The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" creates an overall mood of happiness, and some sadness at the same time. In paragraph @NUM1, the author explains what it was like to live in his home in Cuba. The way he describes his experience in the kitchen cooking and listening to music gives the reader a warm feeling. It says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This sentence not only makes the reader happy for him, but they can see unity in his family. In paragraph @NUM2, he also shows how life with his family was. ""It was a close-knit community of hardworking immigrants..."" He elaborates on the support and shared values that defined their lives. On the other hand, there's also a part of this story that makes the reader feel sad for him. In paragraphs @NUM3 and @NUM4, he explains the difficult life his parents had moving to @LOCATION1. ""They struggled both personally and financially"" it says in paragraph @NUM3. It's upsetting to read this after hearing of all the great times he had with his parents. That's why the end of the memoir and the beginning have two different moods. Both happiness and sadness are shown in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez."""
1132	12958	5	3	"The mood Narciso Rodriguez creates in his memoir is very good and bright. He and his parents survived hard times in their New Jersey home, such as segregation of Cuban-Americans like himself and not always having enough money. Yet he and his family survived because of the unity of his closely-knit community. Immigrants from Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and elsewhere all came together and ignored their differences. They shared food, shared their homes, and shared happiness between them. There was a certain trust among the community, every family holding their door open for anybody,"" knowing that they would do the same for [them]."" (paragraph 3) To make the mood of this excerpt very light and cheerful, Rodriguez uses words like, ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking,"" (paragraph 5) ""innocence of childhood,"" (paragraph 5), ""hard working"", (paragraph 7), ""courage,"" and ""selflessly,"" (paragraph 8) ""grateful... love and sacrifice,"" ""admiration for their strength and perseverance,"" ""spirit of generosity."" (paragraph 9). All of these words show that through solidarity, hope, and courage, people can make a good life for each other, no matter how hard their situation is at first, ultimately demonstrating the power of community in overcoming adversity."
1133	12959	5	3	"Based on the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the mood created by the author in the memoir could be described in many ways. To begin with, the boy is very grateful for his parents and adores them so much. And paragraph two it states, ""the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" Furthermore, his parents left the country Cuba to have a better life for there children. In paragraph five it says, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" What truly stands out is his deep appreciation for their sacrifices. As well, he thanks them and admires their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" As you can see, the mood of the memoir created by the author could be described in many ways, but ultimately, gratitude is a prevailing emotion."
1134	12960	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is a very calm mood. For me personally home has always been a calm place. The author further emphasizes the mood by using words like aromas and passionate, which evoke pleasant and peaceful feelings. The author sets a calm, kind and gentle mood by talking about family and friends, painting a picture of loving relationships and shared experiences. In conclusion the author sets a calm and kind mood by using words and subject matter that I feel are calming, successfully creating a serene atmosphere.
1135	12961	5	3	"The mood created by the author (Narciso Rodriguez) in the memoir was that he was grateful/appreciative for his life, and also happy with his life. Throughout this memoir, I think he has realized and is explaining what family really is and that he is grateful for having one. You'll figure this out when you read this because he states, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" The people around him shaped his understanding. What he also says that proves his mood was grateful is, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He clearly values their contributions to his life. With all this being said, I believe that's what his mood was throughout the memoir, showcasing thankfulness for his unique upbringing and the love he received."
1136	12962	5	3	He creates a calming outgoing mood for the reader. He makes the reader feel, smell and hear the Cuban, Spanish influence around him in his home. The feeling inside his home is warm and bright; the soothing, vibrant Hispanic vibe that runs through the space brings a great feeling to the reader. The descriptions evoke sensory details of rich coffee aromas, rhythmic music, and bright, sun-drenched colors, all contributing to this immersive experience. The reader is left with a feeling of warmth and tranquility, fully enveloped in the welcoming atmosphere of his home.
1137	12963	5	3	"From the reading ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives"", by Narciso Rodriguez sets a certain mood throughout the whole entire reading. That mood is happy and friendly. They based their lives on family and happiness inside their home. He said that ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open,"" this shows that if family or friends needed help they were there for them. Rodriguez also recalls a constant stream of visitors, further illustrating their welcoming nature. It also stated people in your family don't have to be blood related and that many people where welcome to eat dinner with them. This shows how nice and how well the neighborhood got along. They would also surround themselves with Cuban food and music showing that they were proud of who they were and that they made their new home a nice and peaceful environment, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere."
1138	12964	5	3	"The author talks about home and family, which evokes a calm, caring, and happy mood. The author created these moods by talking about memories and how her parents moved from Cuba to give their child a better life and how they take in family members in need until they get back on their feet. She said her parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking that is still with me today, creating a sense of warmth and tradition. Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen, which is like a happy mood. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" which is definitely a calm and happy mood that highlights the joy and security found within those walls. Thus, the author's fond recollections paint a picture of a loving and supportive home environment."
1139	12965	5	3	"In this memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The prints of Our Lives the mood was very happy and made me thankful. My grandparents moved to the U.S. when my mom was just six. They wanted to give her and her brothers and sisters a better life. This is why I am thankful. I live in the city. The mood is also happy because everyone loved eachother. They didnt have the nicest home, but it was full of love. The music was always playing and Family came a lot. The door was always open in the Rodriguez house. The last sentence in this memoir ""I will never Forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This made me smile it was so beautiful. This is how the mood was happy and made me thankful. The next time I see my grand parents I will make shure to thank them for moving to the U.S. and giving are Family a better life."
1140	12966	5	3	I believe the mood that sets off in the beginning of the story is how in her house Cuban music and great aromas from **cooking fill** the air. I also think that it gives a picture of laughter and happiness. And I think that throughout the story **the narrator** tells that **he** realizes, through spending time with **his** community, that his parents are teaching him, just because someone isn't blood-related doesn't mean they can't be like family, as said in the passage. They're teaching him that it is also people that love you and care about you. As **he** continues through the passage, it says that his family is always open to take care of people that they love and need help. **He** soon realizes that all his family gave up from their old lives was so that they could provide a nice home for him and teach him a valuable lesson in life: the true meaning of family. This highlights the theme that family is not just about blood, but about love, support, and community.
1141	12967	5	3	In the memoir this is how the author created the mood, he tells of how his parents lived in a house where it was very poor at that time. His parents immigrated to America where Narciso was born. He was raised in the ghetto. When he was living here it was during the time of racism and segregation. Narciso didnt know his real grandparents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave cuba. This was how the author created the mood.
1142	12968	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is warm, grateful, and very palpable to the reader. One mood the author conveys very deeply is that of his love of his family. However, his ""family"" not only consisted of blood relatives, but also of the immigrants living in the neighborhood. He says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" It is obvious that the author feels very strongly about the good relationships his family had with the other immigrants around them. His mood is warm and compassionate as he talks about how much each one of his community was important to him, highlighting the sense of belonging and mutual support that defined their shared experiences. The next mood conveyed by the author is gratitude and admiration for his parents. In paragraph @NUM1, he talks about how he will be forever grateful for his parents' sacrifices and their hardwork and the numerous times he has told them of his admiration for their strength and courage. However, he does not feel it is enough and says, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The mood shown in this quote is that of thankfulness, and even a small bit of frustration that he cannot fully express his gratitude towards his parents, reflecting the profound impact their values had on shaping his own worldview and emphasizing the enduring power of familial love and appreciation."
1143	12969	5	3	The mood is grateful because in Cuba, which has a central government, they had to sneak to get in. Well, @CAPS2 felt grateful for what his parents did, which was give him a better life. I used to be like him; my parents took a plane to @LOCATION1. We only had @DATE1 of stay, but we overstayed it. We used to have nothing or documents; as the years passed, we @CAPS1 gotting documents and finally the beloved green card. So, @CAPS2 was very grateful and honorable to his parents because of what they did to ensure a better future.
1144	12970	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by himself from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives it talks about this fashion designer's life. One example is in paragraph @NUM1 page @NUM2 it talks about his background. Narciso states ""My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956..."" The paragraph goes on talking about his parents and their names. Next is paragraph @NUM3 page @NUM2. This sets the mood of him growing up in a new environment. For example he states ""Growing up in this new instilled in me a great ""Family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm of segregation prevailed in the United States."" @CAPS1 is on page @NUM5 paragraph @NUM6. It shows the mood of how he loves his house. For example he says ""... I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" In conclusion, the moods conveyed through his reflections on family, community, and home collectively shape the narrative of his formative years, ultimately influencing the artist he became."
1145	12971	5	3	The author creates many moods in the story. While reading this story I felt happy, sometimes sad, and overall it made me feel good. The mood that the author is trying to sell is happiness and unity. Even though many cultures and ethnic backgrounds were in his neighborhood, they all came together as one community, supporting each other through thick and thin. Then at other times I felt sad because he grew up with racism still prevalent in America, witnessing injustices that no child should have to see. The story makes me feel good because the author is trying to say that it is not the materialistic things that make you happy; it is the family and friends that surround you every single day, offering love and unwavering support. Ultimately, the author conveys that genuine connection and shared experiences are what truly enrich our lives and foster lasting happiness.
1146	12972	5	3	"The mood, or general atmosphere created in ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez is happy, peaceful, and gratefulness. ""The innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (∂ @NUM1) The author explains to us how peaceful and happy his home was. They had many celebrations with family and friends and everyone cared about each other. ""In our neighborhood, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (∂ @NUM2) The author lived in a friendly neighborhood where there wasn't much racism. The various cultures lived in harmony. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" (∂ @NUM3) They didn't only consider blood relatives family. Many people were family to them. They always had each others backs and had many celebrations. Most of the time, it was just about a group of people who love each other having a good time with each other. The author was also grateful, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacraficed."" The author's parents moved to the @LOCATION1 to do what was best for their child. They had to find new jobs and give their child a happy life. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Ultimately, it is clear that Rodriguez remembers his childhood home as a place filled with love, community, and immense gratitude for his parents' sacrifices."
1147	12973	5	3	"I believe there was more of a ""thank you"" in the memoir, and here are three reasons. Narciso Rodriguez is thanking his parents for creating a positive environment during his childhood. Like in the excerpt, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" he expresses gratitude for their efforts in making it a loving space. Another reason I think he's thanking his parents is because he was praising them for their choices. In the excerpt, ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done,"" Narciso acknowledges and appreciates their bravery. Narciso is forever grateful to his parents, shown in the excerpt, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" highlighting his deep appreciation. These examples demonstrate how the mood was more of a ""thank you"" in the memoir, reflecting Rodriguez's profound gratitude."
1148	12974	5	3	"On paragraph @NUM1 in the article it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" I think that the mood the author is creating in the memoir is happiness because Narciso is very grateful to his parents, highlighting feelings of appreciation and positive regard for their actions."
1149	12975	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The blue @CAPS1 of our lives it gives you alot of different moods.

Also I got the mood of welcomeness because his parents always let people In the house. I know his parents did this from when it states ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"" @CAPS2 @NUM2. Lastly this gave me the mood of love.

I know this from when it states ""They had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find"" @CAPS2 @NUM3. These are the moods the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The blue @CAPS1 of our lives evokes in me, highlighting the power of music, family, and sacrifice in shaping our emotional understanding of a story."

His reflections reveal a deep appreciation for the values they instilled in him, shaping him into the person and designer he became, ultimately underscoring a profound sense of thankfulness.
1151	12977	5	3	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, Narciso really sets a joyous, happy mood when he describes his home. He gives the reader a feeling of just how much he loved his home.

1152	12978	5	3	This passage has a very calm and happy mood. He is looking back on his childhood and the memories. He talked about the cheerful house, people and neighborhood.

The way he felt about her childhood was potrayed beautifully in this piece and that really helped the reader get into the happiness and community like feel. Her gratefullness potrayed into the mood and made the entire piece fun to read, leaving a lasting positive impression.
1153	12979	5	3	The main mood that is portrayed by the author is coziness or family, because his parents gave up everything and came to the United States so that Narciso could have a great childhood, and he did. Narciso's parents turned a small apartment into a happy, comforting place that people would go to for a happy reunion, no matter where they were from. The simple act of staying over brought people together, fostering connection and warmth. That is how Narciso grew up, surrounded by love and community, and with that, he was lucky and grateful for the sacrifices made and the welcoming environment he experienced.
1154	12980	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is being grateful. First, the author reveals her gratefulness by complimenting her mother and father. She states, ""my mother and father had to come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"" (@NUM1). The author is grateful because her parents came to this country. But she is grateful because they didn't come for themselves, they came for her. They gave up everything they had for her. Next, all her thanking shows her being grateful. The author tells her parents of her ""admiration for their strength and perseverance"" (@NUM2) and has ""thanked them repeatedly"" (@NUM2). The author reveals gratefulness through what she tells her parents, expressing how deeply she means it. She is grateful for their perseverance and for their strength through this whole process and thanks them over and over again. Finally, she is grateful when they are leaving their house. She reveals, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM4).

And now, she is grateful that they have enough money to have a bigger home. The mood created by the author in the memoir is being grateful, a feeling that permeates the entire narrative, highlighting the sacrifices and love of her parents."
1155	12981	5	3	"The mood of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is very loving, grateful, and warm. Firstly, the way that Narciso describes his family and friends and home life is very endearing and clearly expresses the love that he had for the people around him and the building he lived in. The memoir states, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.

A lot of their family lives close by, and they often spend time together, usually for meals as it says in paragraph @NUM1, highlighting the central role food plays in fostering their familial bonds and sense of community. This shared cultural background and close-knit family structure contribute significantly to the overall feeling of love and unity that permeates the author's narrative.
1158	12984	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The blue prints of our lives by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso explains the mood of his home. One way is in paragraph 1 when he says ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixed with the aromas of the Kitchen"". This creates the mood of family. It gives you this sense of a warm family. Another way is in paragraph 2. He says ""My parents always Kept their arms open to the many people we considered family"".

In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows how close and kind the neighborhood around the house was, demonstrating a supportive atmosphere. The end of paragraph @NUM2 it states ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.""

1161	12987	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood that is created by the author is love and sacrifice. In the memoir, the author shows love by not only showing the love between the child and the parents but by also showing the love throughout the community. The author shows sacrifice by showing what the parents had to give up in order for their child to have a better life. In the memoir, it talks a lot about the neighborhood, ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.

1162	12988	5	3	In this paragraph I'm going to tell you the mood created by the author in the memoir I just read. One mood that the author had was happy. The reason why I said that is because everytime he spoke about being Cuban or about his family, he spoke with this joy or pride in his voice, a sense of belonging evident in his words. Also when he was talking about Spanish, Italian and Cuban all like being a family, the author conveyed a feeling of warmth and connection. Another mood he had was kind of sad. The reason why I say that is because when he was talking about how he couldn't see his real grandparents until 1970, he sounded a little depressed about that separation and the longing it created. I also feel that he is a very happy man for the rest of the memoir. Those are the moods that I think the author created during the memoir, shaping the reader's experience with both moments of joy and moments of reflection.
1163	12989	5	3	"The memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, enholds a mood of happiness and warmth, which is described in several ways. Happiness serves as an apt description of the mood in the story, due to the narrator's constant reference to a joyful essence which fills her apartment house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" This represents how happiness transpires throughout their home, and how everybody can feel free to be whoever they want to be. Consequently, Narciso's house is a warm, happy environment, a sanctuary where love and laughter resonate. Another example which describes the mood in the memoir is how Narciso explains how there is always a friend or family member in the house. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote, spoken by Narciso, further explains how growing up surrounded by love and laughter and warmth, creates a positive influence that remains instilled in a person forever. This reflects how the mood of the story is happiness as well. Finally, a last example which concludes how the mood is described within the memoir is how the author illustrates the admiration that Narciso feels for his parents. He describes how these are the words to show his gratefulness toward his parents, and how he admires them both for leaving their hometown to raise a family. This contributes to how the mood of happiness exists among the memoirs content, and furthermore describes the mood that was created by the author, ultimately solidifying the memoir's overall feeling of warmth and contentment."
1164	12990	5	3	"The mood in this memoir changes throughout the story. First off, the mood starts with being friendly. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This tells us everyone in the neighborhood is nice and cooperative. In the middle of the story, the mood is strong and determined. ""They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters."" This tells the people had to stay strong through hard times and persevere to survive. Lastly, the end of the story is grateful. ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" This tells how the narrator is thankful for the experiences and lessons learned. All in all, the moods in the story fit together nicely, creating a cohesive narrative about community, resilience, and appreciation."

My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This shows love because even if they weren't blood related, they still consider themselves family and cared for each other beyond belief. This memoir also has the mood of selflessness because Rodriguez says that they moved selflessly, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved and ended up facing many hardships to their new country. The last mood shown in this memoir is gratefullness, exemplified by Rodriguez's appreciation for the values instilled in him.

1168	12994	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author creates a mood in the memoir in many ways. For example, the author is in a loving mood at the beginning of the memoir. In paragraph two, he says ""...a love of cooking that is still with me today,"" illustrating the fondness he holds for his upbringing. In addition, the author is in a caring mood in the middle of the memoir. In paragraph four, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family,"" showing their generosity and welcoming nature. Lastly, the author is in a somber mood near the end. In paragraph six, he says ""They struggled both personally and financially...,"" reflecting on the hardships his parents faced. In conclusion, the author effectively creates a range of moods in the memoir through specific details and reflections on his family and experiences."
1169	12995	5	3	The mood of @CAPS1 (presumably Narciso Rodriguez's family) in the article is one of happiness and @CAPS2, relax, and grateful because their grandparents are coming from Cuba. Narciso Rodriguez feels like being an immigrant from Cuba and making a family in the United States is hard because you have to start your whole life over to get a job and provide for your family. This creates a feeling of both joy at family reunification and reflection on the immigrant experience, shaping the overall mood of the memoir.
1170	12996	5	3	In this memoir, the mood is very light hearted and kind. It gives you a feeling of peace and community. Several times the author tries to show appreciation. Not for any one thing in particular, just gratitude. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, he puts phrases in parentheses for no reason other than to show gratitude for his life as a child, adding a gentle, reflective quality to the narrative. As a result of this, while reading you get a feeling of peace and kindness. Because of his repeated display of gratitude, the mood is light hearted and unserious, fostering a sense of warmth and contentment within the reader.
1171	12997	5	3	"The author creates a unique mood in the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. The mood is loving, caring, and kind, stemming from the author's reflections on his memories. It is loving because he is talking about all the close relationships he had with his family and friends, highlighting the importance of connection. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The mood was also tinged with sadness, perhaps a bittersweet appreciation, as throughout the memoir he expresses thank-you to his parents for all their opportunities. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also another mood is happy, happy from all the great memories he recounts. He talks about all his family and friends hanging out and having a great time, celebrating life's simple pleasures. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author creates a unique mood, blending love, gratitude, and happiness to create a truly heartfelt narrative."
1172	12998	5	3	The mood that the author created in the memoir is a very loving and caring one. This is because the author tells what his parents gave up just for him to have a good life. That means his parents really loved him because they wanted him to grow up and have a good life. And that was something that they could find in @LOCATION1. It is very caring of them because when they moved to @LOCATION1 not only did they look after their baby, but other people that needed help as well. To them everyone in their neighborhood was their family and they all looked after each other, sharing food and offering support. The mood is really both loving and caring because it shows how an group of people are so close, that they love and care for each other as one family. No matter what even in hard times one of them will always have their door open for them, and they can always relay on them. That is what family is about.
1173	12999	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very pleasant, proud, and happy. He shows that in growing up in such a wonderful loving and supportive family and home that he felt that the experience he had in his home was just exceptional. He believed that by growing up in this environment instilled a great sense family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. He was very grateful to his parents for his love and sacrifice and couldn't ask for anything more. By growing up in such a wonderful place he will always never forget how his parents turned his simple house into a home. He cherishes the memories and the lessons learned, which shaped him into the person he is today.
1174	13000	5	3	In this memoir, the author creates a mood. The mood that this author creates is one of gratefulness. The reason that I say gratefulness is because Narciso Rodriguez is so grateful, and so happy to have two loving, caring, selfless parents. He's grateful to have not only a house, but a warm, cozy home, where he's grown up in and had so many memories. He is grateful to have all the perks of a traditional Cuban home, with the food, the music, and all of the people. Narciso is grateful that his parents basically just gave up their own lives and dropped everything, so that he could have a better life. Narciso cannot imagine being uprooted to a new country, not knowing the language, not knowing anything, and leaving everything he knows behind. However that's what his parents did; they sacrificed so much for him, and he appreciates that more than anything. I think that the mood that the author chose for this story was perfect in conveying the depth of his appreciation and love.
1175	13001	5	3	I think in some parts @CAPS1 was happy. And then in other parts @CAPS1 was sad because @CAPS1 is talking about her first house in America. @CAPS1 is happy because @CAPS1 can look back on the memories and be happy, even though the experience of actually living there might have held challenges alongside the joy.
1176	13002	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is @CAPS1_WARM and @CAPS1_HEARTFELT. I say this @CAPS2_BECAUSE his family always let people from the neighborhood come over and they were like family. His parents let people stay with them ""until they got back on their feet."" @CAPS3_The author admired his parents for their ""strength and perseverance"" through everything they had been through, demonstrating their unwavering commitment to helping others. This paints a picture of a loving and supportive environment, contributing to the overall warm and heartfelt tone of the memoir."
1177	13003	5	3	A mood for the memoir would be redeeming. It would be a redeeming mood because it talks about struggles like being an immigrant and being poor. It also talks about how a community that is going through the same struggles can come together and help each other out, showing resilience and hope. The author also mentions how her parents sacrificed a lot to help her accomplish what she has become today, highlighting their love and dedication. Because the tragedies and hardships ultimately pave the way for the author's success and growth, it creates a sense of triumph over adversity, solidifying the overall redeeming mood.
1178	13004	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir would probably be gratefulness. One way the mood is gratefulness is how much Narciso likes his culture. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that he is grateful for his cultural heritage and upbringing. Another way is how much family he has that aren't really family. ""Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often then not. Also at the table were Sergio and Edelmira... My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also... regularly joined our table."" This shows that he is grateful for all the extended family members and friends who felt like family, emphasizing the strong sense of community. Lastly would be how his parents cared for him. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age..."" This demonstrates his profound appreciation for the values instilled in him by his parents. Ultimately, the memoir evokes a strong feeling of gratefulness for family, friends, culture, and the values passed down through generations."
1179	13005	5	3	The mood in this memoir is that Narciso is happy and very grateful for his parents’ sacrifices and willpower to make his life better and give him more opportunities. He recognizes the hardships they endured, perhaps working long hours and facing numerous challenges, all with the aim of providing him with a brighter future than they had. This understanding fosters a deep sense of appreciation within him, coloring his recollections with warmth and thankfulness. He sees their efforts not just as parental duty, but as acts of profound love and dedication, which further intensifies his gratitude for the paths they paved for him. It is this awareness of their unwavering commitment that ultimately shapes the overall positive and appreciative tone of the memoir.
1180	13006	5	3	The mood of the @CAPS1 is appreciative and happy because Narciso Rodriguez parents immigrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1, New Jersey. The parents lived in a one room apartment for one year, and when Narciso Rodriguez was born, they moved into a @NUM1, two room house. The parents try to make the house as comfortable as can be. Their journey and sacrifices contributed to Rodriguez's success, making the mood one of gratitude.
1181	13007	5	3	The mood set by the author is very solemn. He started by telling the scenery he lived in during a time of segregation. That was hard because he was Cuban. He didn't have a lot of money, and lived in an apartment. His life was like a somewhat below average life today. Towards the middle the memoir was still serious but happier in a sense. It was happier because we know that he could have more life opportunities in @LOCATION1. He grew up and actually met people and made friends. Also he had a caring family that did what they could to make his life easier for him. He made the memoir nice and passionate, detailing struggles but also the warmth of familial bonds. The moods started off a bit shaky and very serious. Then he got into a happier mood by telling how his parents and family were good to him. It ended in the same mood started in the middle of the passage, happy, suggesting a sense of hope and resilience despite earlier hardships.
1182	13008	5	3	The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is comfortable. It's comfortable because as I read the memoir it made me think of my own home life and how important my family is to me. It also allowed me to see how full and good his was too. I mean I love his descriptions of the food cooking in the kitchen and all the great smells filling the air. Also, the wonderful music that played and the people that always came over to visit, sharing stories and laughter. And all that good family comfort that we all crave at one time or another. That's the feeling I get when I read Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, a sense of warmth and belonging.
1183	13009	5	3	"In the memoir the mood is very loving, love, and thankfull. The mood is loving in many different ways. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also, ""it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" Love is also expressed throughout this memoir. ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refuges to celebrate their arrival to this country, and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" Love is expressed by the family gathering a the dinner table more times that not. The greatest mood in the memoir is how thankfull he is to his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly,"" showing how deeply he values their efforts. Ultimately, the memoir's prevailing mood is one of love and gratitude, particularly towards his parents."
1184	13010	5	3	The mood is memorable because he loves remembering everything that he did in his childhood. Also, he put the memories that he really liked in parentheses (like building forts and playing tag). He also thanked everybody for their part in his lifetime. That is why it is a memorable reflection on his life's journey.
1185	13011	5	3	The mood created by the description in the memoir is soothing and peaceful. It explains how peaceful Narciso is at his parents' house. The passage also explains how many friends he has. Narciso is grateful for his heritage, which helps set a good mood, showcasing contentment and appreciation.
1186	13012	5	3	In the memoir a 25 year old man Narciso Rodriguez, Sr. could afford to move to the modest, three-room apartment soon called home. (PAGE 2) In 1961 he was born in a simple house in Newark, New Jersey. Narciso, Sr. was a mood like man he was greatful, kind, traditional, and happy. Narciso was greatful because his parents passed a rich culinary skills and a love of cooking to him. He was happy because he could move to an affordable three-room apartment. Narciso is traditional because he would listen to Cuban Music that would fill the air with mixing the aromas of the kitchen (PAGE 3), he would also have a Cuban feast which brought life and the love (PAGE 4). His babysitter was his first friend that lived above him and graced his kitchen with meals. This man's life was very successful because his traits would show about his community, demonstrating how his character fostered strong connections and a fulfilling life.
1187	13013	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author explains the true meaning of family and home. The mood is extremely deep and personal as he describes the love and selflessness his family expressed. He explains that his mother and father emigrated from Cuba and moved to New Jersey so that Narciso, their son, would have a better, successful life. Reading this memoir, I can picture Narciso getting very emotional expressing how grateful he is for his parents and family. He explains, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home"" (Rodriguez). This sentence and last few paragraphs change the mood a great deal. It went from happy, appreciation, and an explanation of his life to deep, incredibly personal, and to his complete thoughts. Narciso had a great love and admiration for his family and friends like most people should be able to experience like Narciso writes about in his memoir, showcasing the profound impact of familial love and support."
1188	13014	5	3	The mood created by the author was a very unique one. The author was remembering and cherishing the memories he had of his old home. He described his home by saying how brave and courageous his parents were to give him a better life, also how his family was so rich in culture and how his family and neighbors would always visit because times were tough, but the author’s parents never turned them down. The author made it sound that it was the perfect childhood, filled with love and warmth, and described it with such detail and passion, emphasizing the strong sense of community and familial bonds that defined his upbringing; and that is why the mood is so unique and special.
1189	13015	5	3	The mood created by the author was warm, welcoming, and one of gratefulness. When the author described his home, it gave a feeling of warmth and it was very welcoming. He made me feel like I was invited to his home with open arms and I could feel the comforting environment around me. He gave off a feeling of gratefulness when he explained how grateful he was to his parents for sacrificing everything and how much he appreciates everything they have done for him, showcasing his deep respect. He showed in the passage the warmth and love present in his home, reinforcing the positive atmosphere he wished to convey.
1190	13016	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, Narciso Rodriguez creates a powerful mood for the reader. Right off the bat, I felt love and thoughtfulness, which persisted throughout the story. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This immediately resonated with my own experiences, bringing my parents to mind. My father sacrificed his career, and my mother her family, to provide a better future for my brothers and me. This feeling is beyond words; I struggle to articulate the depth of my gratitude, much like Narciso. Secondly, the admiration I felt mirrored Narciso's. She described her parents vividly, allowing me to empathize with her perspective. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and thanked them repeatedly."" Their sacrifices were truly remarkable and served as a powerful lesson. From Narciso's story, I experienced a sense of admiration, gratefulness, and connection, which I believe are the primary moods evoked throughout his narrative, ultimately leaving a lasting impression of familial love and appreciation."
1191	13017	5	3	His mood was like happy and unsatisfying at the same time. They also say how his life is, so I think this book is good too. Or we can say article. It's all about how his life story is, and based on what I've read, it seems like a worthwhile read.
1192	13018	5	3	"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez you can really see the moods of love, friendship, and perseverance that are created. In the second paragraph you can see the love that was in Narciso Rodriguez's life and home. ""Here, the innocence of childhood the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to our lives in a warm home."" Love was definitely a big mood that ran throughout the Rodriguez home and it shows greatly in this memoir. Another mood that is shown very strongly in Rodriguez's memoir is friendship. In the last sentence of the fourth paragraph you can see this, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This sentence shows what great friendship and love the Rodriguez family offered by always lending a helping hand. The final mood that is strongly shown throught this memoir is perseverance. The Rodriguez family moved from Cuba into a one-room apartment in New Jersey it states in paragraph one. The Rodriguez family took whatever jobs they could get and just wanted the best for their children, even through difficult circumstances. The Rodriguez family always rose when they fell and in this memoir that mood shines greatly. In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez family is immensely important to him and that mood shows greatly."
1193	13019	5	3	"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a heart-warming, and comforting mood for the readers. First, we see this comforting mood being established through the setting. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" (RODRIGUEZ 1). This creatively loving setting gives the reader a sense of comfort when reading the piece. Next, we see this sense of heart-warming coming from Rodriguez's word choice. ""... there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age..."" (RODRIGUEZ 2). This rich, vivid word choice sets a caring mood through out the piece. Lastly, the family's background started out somewhat bitter, and depressing when Rodriguez explains their financial instability in RODRIGUEZ 3, but then later on, we see the family moving to NEW JERSEY, and finding comfort in their new home. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us,"" (RODRIGUEZ 4). This sense of family contributes to the heart- warming mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir, showcasing the power of love and community in overcoming adversity."
1194	13020	5	3	"The mood that the author created in this memoir was love and gratefullness. The author is trying to get their message across about how much a family is bonded together and how much there is to be thankful for. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows how much love the author has to be grateful for. He is also trying to say that there is no way to express his emotions and love to his parents. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The author is humbled by their actions and feels forever indebted. The authors main point is to thank their parents for everything they have done. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" showcasing the author's deep appreciation for the nurturing environment they provided, which ultimately underscores the memoir's overall theme of love and gratitude."
1195	13021	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is love, happiness, and selflessness. The part of the memoir that emphasized the mood of love was when the author mentioned that, ""It was here where I learned the true definition of family. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" The mood for that excerpt was love because it explains how much he cared for his family and neighbors. There were many excerpts in this memoir that gave the mood selflessness, As such, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers, in the country they love."" This indicates selflessness by explaining how they left behind their jobs, family, and friends, all to give their children what was best for them. The overall mood of the story was happy because it explained their happiness, struggle, courage, good outcome, and beloved memories, all culminating in a sense of joy and contentment about the experiences shared."
1196	13022	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was a mood of admiration. I think it was a mood of admiration because Narciso admires the fact that his mother and father both left their ""families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" The mood that the memoir sets is the mood of family and friends. I think the memoir sets the mood of family and friends because it talks a lot about the meaning of family; for example, in paragraph one, the author says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" That means that even though someone is not blood related to you, you can love them just as much as if they were. One thing the memoir said was, ""I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This means that his parents turned a small house into a welcoming, loving place that holds so many memories, further solidifying the theme of family and the author's appreciation for his upbringing. Ultimately, the memoir uses these elements to create an atmosphere of both admiration and a deep appreciation for the bonds of chosen family."
1197	13023	5	3	The mood created by the author was grateful and happy. The mood was grateful because Narciso was glad his parents moved to the @LOCATION1 and started their wonderful home. Narciso was grateful for this because he grew up in an environment he loved. The mood created by the author is happy. The mood is happy because Narciso is happy that he grew up around people who loved him. This made him happy because he knew that he was safe and loved with these people. When his community of differences came together to form one community, this made Narciso happy. The mood is both grateful and happy. I would also be grateful for this, happiness is key to having friendships and families, and Narciso's story exemplifies the power of a loving and unified community in fostering that happiness.
1198	13024	5	3	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is set to reflect family values and memories. For example in paragraph @NUM1 she explains that her family is from Cuba and they raised her in a replica of a traditional Cuban home. She tells us that her parents both cook traditional Cuban foods and teach her how to cook as well, passing down their heritage. Then another example is from paragraph @NUM2 when she tells us that her family stays with her a lot, such as uncles, aunts, cousins, and grandparents; they @CAPS1 stay with her until they are able to get on their feet again, showcasing their strong support system. Finally in paragraph @NUM3, @NUM4 and @NUM5 it explains the sacrifice that her parents had to give in order to start a new life in the US, and about how her family takes in other refugees and also about how she will never forget her parents and all the memories that go along with the house, solidifying the importance of family and heritage in her life. These details collectively paint a picture of a close-knit, supportive family deeply rooted in their Cuban heritage, shaping the narrative's overall sentimental tone.
1199	13025	5	3	The mood of this memoir is love and staying a family. The author sends a message to her readers when one leaves what they once had, emphasizing the enduring power of familial bonds. Her tone tells the mood by writing with passion. The mood is basically is being happy with what you have. That's how the family written about acts in this memoir, demonstrating contentment and unity amidst life's changes, which ultimately highlights the importance of cherishing present relationships.
1200	13026	5	3	The mood at the beginning was kind of sad, but then Narciso starts to realize the good things in her life, like how her mom turned a simple place into a home, and she says she's thankful for her Cuban heritage. In paragraph @NUM1, she says she is most thankful for her caring and selfless parents and that she loves them dearly for everything they do, not just for her, but for the world, showing her deep appreciation for their positive influence. Ultimately, Narciso's shift in perspective demonstrates the power of gratitude in overcoming sadness and recognizing the blessings in one's life.
1201	13027	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was meant to be a happy and thankful mood. The mood was created happy because the child Narciso was very happy that his parents moved to @LOCATION1. He was also happy because his house was not just a house it was a home, filled with warmth and laughter. The kin Narciso was thankful because his parents let other people into the home until they have somewhere else they can call home, offering them shelter and support. He is also thankful that he got his parents' marvelous culinary skills so he can cook very well, a skill he cherishes. He is also thankful for his parents' love and sacrifice, which shaped him into the person he is. The mood that we are supposed to get is a happy yet calm mood while we read this because there is nothing too exciting, but there are some parts where you get happy for what they did, and you feel calm because, as I said, there is nothing really jumping out at you; it is just a life story, a heartwarming reflection that inspires a sense of peace and gratitude.
1202	13028	5	3	The mood the author created in the memoir was joyful and optimistic. In the memoir, the author describes his home and how even though the house wasn't much, his parents made it feel inviting and comfortable with their warm smiles and constant laughter. In his neighborhood, all the people were friends and took care of each other when they needed help, sharing food and offering support during tough times. The author's home reflected the Cuban culture because of his parents, filled with the aroma of traditional dishes and the sounds of lively music. The author describes the hardships his parents had to go through like adjusting to a colder climate and not getting good jobs. Even though they had their own troubles, they were selfless and didn't let their problems get to them, always putting their children first. The author is very grateful for how his parents gave him a home and taught him what a family really was, instilling in him values of love, resilience, and community.
1203	13029	5	3	The mood @CAPS1 created was a mood of happiness and gratitude. @CAPS1 states how he will always be grateful for what his parents did for him. He also stated that he admired them and honestly could never repay them for everything they did. This shows how @CAPS1 appreciates how his parents worked so hard to make his life better. He is forever grateful, and this deep appreciation fosters a sense of joy and contentment in reflecting upon their sacrifices and unwavering support. Ultimately, the prevailing sentiment is one of heartfelt thankfulness.
1204	13030	5	3	"In the memoir, ""@PERSON1,"" by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood is set right from the beginning. The first thing said to start the mood was, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am extremely grateful.)"" This shows the author is grateful and happy, establishing a positive tone. The memoir also said, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows how the author is very proud of their heritage and upbringing. Also lastly the memoir mentions, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This again shows how grateful the author is for their family's dedication. In this passage the mood is set to be grateful, happy, and loving right from the start, painting a picture of a warm and appreciative childhood."
1205	13031	5	3	The mood this memoir created was a warm, grateful feeling, evident in his constant praise for his parents and how deeply he loves his tiny home nestled in his hometown. He often reflects on his childhood, sharing anecdotes that highlight the simple joys of growing up surrounded by the familiar comfort of his close-knit community. The narrative emphasizes how grateful he is for his parents' selflessness, recalling sacrifices they made to ensure he had opportunities they never did, further solidifying the overall heartwarming tone and leaving the reader with a sense of appreciation for family and the enduring power of humble beginnings.
1206	13032	5	3	The mood of this memoir is slightly difficult, somewhat depressing, yet grateful, and now I am going to explain to you how. The mood is slightly difficult and depressing because there is a different culture and a brand new language to learn, which can be isolating. Also, in the United States, you have to get a new job, which brings financial uncertainties and the stress of adapting to a new professional environment. This short story is also grateful because you have an amazing opportunity to start a very better life and get a great education, opening doors to personal and professional growth that might not have been available otherwise. This complex blend of emotions shapes the overall tone, highlighting the challenges and the blessings that come with such a significant life change.
1207	13033	5	3	Narciso Rodriguez. The author, @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez, in my opinion, created a pretty good story. He knew when to express excitement and when to maintain a calmer tone, resulting in a well-paced narrative. The author used exclamation marks effectively to convey happiness or sadness, enhancing the emotional impact. Overall, I found this to be a good story and I enjoyed it, as the mood aligned perfectly with the narrative.
1208	13034	5	3	The author creates a grateful mood. The author writes about how his parents had good jobs in Cuba but left everything to give their children better lives in a new country. He also writes about how he grew up, with his parents teaching him about music, cooking, and the importance of family bonds. His parents never got the jobs they deserved because of the barriers to work they faced, all for their children's sake. The author is grateful for the sacrifices his parents made so he could have a better life and opportunities they were denied. This deep appreciation underscores the powerful impact of their selfless choices.
1209	13035	5	3	"The mood created by the author of the memoir exposes various emotions and contrasts. In paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, the author talks a lot about culture, he explains how they could not live without having their practice in their lives. ""Rich culinary skills and the love of cooking (and for which I am internally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) ...""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity"". Another mood the author captures is gratefulness. In paragraph six the author explains how he is so grateful for the strength and courage his parents showed from moving away from Cuba. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have done."" The final way the author creates a mood is during the last sentence of the memoir. The author states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This quote captures the mood of being thankful for the unity of his family. He looks up to his parents for making his life as great as it is today. These are some moods the author creates throughout the memoir, revealing a deep appreciation for his heritage and family bonds."
1210	13036	5	3	"Throughout the story, Narciso Rodriguez shows examples of how grateful, loved, and unified his family felt with their struggles they had overcame and heritage they were proud of.

1211	13037	5	3	The author of this memoir presented a kind of grateful and cheerful mood. I believe it is this type of mood because in the memoir he talks so much about how he is so grateful that his parents were such caring and selfless people, moving from their home country, Cuba, just for the sake of their children's future. He presents the cheerful mood by focusing on the good things in his life with his parents, both at home and in the neighborhood. Examples include his positive descriptions of how all the cultures harmoniously coexisted in his area. He also reminisces about the good times he shared with his parents in the kitchen, highlighting their loving presence. The memoir he left was definitely a positive one, filled with appreciation, rather than a negative or resentful reflection.
1212	13038	5	3	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the mood of this is full of love and happiness. When Narciso is talking about his mother and father he starts to talk about how they always loved and cared. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that the whole house was filled with love because of Narciso's parents. Also, the way Narciso talks about his parents shows that he loved his parents deeply and cherished their presence in his life. This also showed happiness because since he would never forget his home it must've been a place of comfort and joy. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebration that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This demonstrates the abundance of happiness and warmth within the home, fostered by the frequent gatherings of loved ones and the joyous atmosphere of constant celebration. In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the mood of this is full of love and happiness."
1213	13039	5	3	The mood created by the author is outstanding. The mood is nice, and warm-hearted, almost like a comforting embrace.

Also in this memoir it talked about her parents making the best of what they do have and always helping people in their communitie hoping that they would return the favor if needed. In their neighborhood all the races were together in unity despite the customs else where. In @LOCATION1 her parent's struggled both personally and finecially and they had to accept they might not get the jobs they deserve but they did it all for their kids, they had to endure the tough times for the better of their kids. Narciso has thanked his parents repeatedly for their love and sacrifice but in reality he says there is no way to express his gratitude. Narciso said he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home, filled with love and support. His parents perseverance is the basis of his life today that taught him great lessons, and this profound sense of gratitude permeates the entire narrative, underscoring the lasting impact of their sacrifices.
1216	13042	5	3	The mood created by the author I think he was in a good mood because the story didn't talk about anything bad; it talked about happiness and how parents raised their children with no help from anyone, and how their children felt when they were grown—they were happy and proud. This positive focus suggests an optimistic and celebratory mood from the author.
1217	13043	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is proud. This is the mood because he is showing thanks to all of the things that he learned in his childhood that he is proud of. One example of this is when the author talks about his Cuban heritage and how he still loves Cuban music. He is also proud of his parents immigrating to the @LOCATION1 to start a better life for him. He is also proud because even though the other people that lived in the neighborhood with him were of different backgrounds everyone accepted each other.

The boy in the story was very happy about how his parents took care of him and gave him a safe environment to grow up in; he said that home is where @CAPS2 feel genuinely happy and want to stay there the rest of your life. Ultimately, the author conveys that the nurturing environment fostered a sense of belonging and enduring happiness that shaped his perspective.
1219	13045	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is relaxed, happiness and thankfulness. Narciso makes their home feel peaceful and relaxed. ""a great sense that family had nothing to do with being blood related."" This shows that Narciso is very happy with his household and his life that Narciso shares with all of his ""family."" Narciso is very thankful for his parents for giving him a good life and for giving up theirs in Cuba to come to America to help give him a better life.

His reflections reveal a deep appreciation for the sacrifices made and the loving environment he experienced."
1220	13046	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is almost remorseful, remembering his childhood home and his family life that includes his neighbors and extended family. Narciso Rodriguez creates a feeling of being home and being surrounded by people you love. He explains how his first friend was his babysitter and the person who lived above him, highlighting the close-knit community. And his real grandparents were still in Cuba, so his downstairs neighbors became his surrogate grandparents, further emphasizing the theme of found family. He also creates a mood of having nowhere to turn when it came to his parents getting jobs in the United States, as they had to settle with jobs underequipped for their abilities. His parents, he said, ""came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This sacrifice, the author implies, transformed the physical structure of his childhood house into a true home, filled with love and purpose."
1221	13047	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez describes his loving family and creates an appreciative, loving, and homey, comforting mood for the reader. The author thanks his parents for their kind and loving actions. It makes the reader feel admiration towards his parents and the author is trying to create a sense of appreciation and gratitude towards his parents. In paragraph 1, the author explains his appreciation for his parents; ""But in reality, there's no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed on me at such an early age and demonstration of how Important friends and family really are."" The author is also trying to create a comforting mood. When he explains the atmosphere of his home, he is trying to create a homey mood; ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (Rodriguez, 2). This quote is comforting and adds to the homey mood. The author is also trying to create a loving mood in the sense that he is explaining the caring acts of his parents. In paragraph 3, the author describes his generous parents, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to... many people...

Hope was present because his family helped others by letting them temporarily stay with them until they got back on their feet, which provided hope for the extended family. Family was a key element because in the last paragraph he explains how in this tiny apartment he learned the definition of ""family"" through welcoming refugees, celebrating his first birthdays, and having a loving, caring environment. Finally, I think happiness was conveyed because he explains how grateful he was for his parents coming to America to give him a better life, and also in paragraph two he explains how his home environment was filled with cooking and music, which can be factors of happiness, ultimately shaping a positive and grateful tone. These elements combine to illustrate some of the moods that the author was trying to show."
1223	13049	5	3	In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez writes about his life-changing experience. The mood of the piece is happy, reflecting on the positive impact of his heritage.

He's very proud of his parents for the risk they took for him, a sacrifice that shaped his life and instilled in him a profound appreciation for his roots, which is why the mood of the story is happy.
1224	13050	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, several moods such as comfort, sympathy and a sense of family are created by the author. Immediately as I began to read I felt comforted by the author writing about the home and family. I felt especially warm inside when he talked of his fond memories with friends. As the author continues, you cannot help developing a sense of security. However, once you continue reading and get into the struggles of his upbringing, the mood darkens.

This quote creates a calm loving mood because it explains that the author enjoyed his childhood, and loved his family who loved him back.

All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" Rodriguez again shows the love towards his friends in the beginning of paragraph three.

Also in the last sentence in paragraph four Rodriguez explains the people his parents help stating, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.""

1226	13052	5	3	The author creates a happy and grateful mood in the memoir. Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. In our neigborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celabrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays, surrounded by laughter and song. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was where I learned the real definition of family, bound by shared experiences and unwavering support. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love.

Narciso could tell that his parents love him very much and Narciso is grateful for that. In paragraph three Narciso states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso has the opportunity to be born in America and having a better life. Narciso also learned that Narciso could love a non blood relative because they could be his family too. There were many people that were like family to him. Narciso loved them and they were happy spending time with each other, showing the strong bonds he formed. In this memoir the mood would most likely be happy and loving, reflecting the positive relationships described."
1228	13054	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir shows a kind community, carefulness, and courage. My first quote is ""...hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This quote means the mood of the community is kind and helping, demonstrating empathy and support for newcomers facing hardship. My second quote is ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" This quote means that his parents' mood was careful, always ready to assist and do anything for people if they needed help, highlighting their generosity and inclusive nature. My third and last quote is ""My mother and father had came to this country with such courage."" This quote means like before they came to the United States they had courage and now they were going to make it and be successful, showcasing their determination to build a new life despite the challenges.

Another part of the memoir that really portraits to me a loving mood is the way the author describes this community, and his parents' sacrifice is shown by these next quotes: ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need,"" ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially,"". The details and emotions he uses in those quotes makes the mood a loving one, especially understanding the sacrifices made for future generations. All in all, the author gives a great and loving mood in this memoir."
1253	13079	5	3	"While reading the memoir titled ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives by Narciso Rodriguez, I could feel the great sense of mood and emotion that the author poured into it. To describe the mood he created in this memoir, I would have to describe it as a great sense of love and gratitude for some things called home and family. This memoir is just gushing appreciation for family, parents, love, courage, and a caring home everywhere you look. Rodriguez starts off by describing his Cuban heritage and how it was always there during his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""My parents... Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."". Here you can really feel he appreciated how his parents incorporated his heritage into his daily life as a child and how he still has fond memories of those times. Rodriguez then goes on to discuss in paragraphs @NUM2 and @NUM3 the community he had grown up in and what he learned from being part of such a tight knit neighborhood, such as to open up your heart and home to those in need and to never hesitate when the people you care about need help. This is shown in para @NUM2, in two instances when he says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" And where it also says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship."" Rodriguez's reflection highlights the profound impact of a supportive and diverse community on his understanding of kinship and compassion. At the end of his memoir, Rodriguez then goes on to describe the love and appreciation he has for his parents for having ""Such courage"" and how ""They came selflessly"" (para, @NUM5) to @LOCATION1. In para @NUM6 it tells, ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" Rodriguez really tells of how their faithfulness and great examples have also helped shape him into the man he is today. To conclude, all I truly need to say is that Rodriguez did a marvelous job with giving his memoir a very generous dosage of mood. It spoke volumes of how indebted he feels to his parents for giving him a loving home and teaching him how much family means, which I believe is the best gift a parent can give their child."
1254	13080	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was being grateful. The author takes paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2 to fully explain his gratitude to his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). These are the @NUM5 main points from paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. The author is thanking his parents for the numerous amount of things they have done for him, he is grateful. The author shows his gratitude throughout the excerpt, this common mood always remains. For instance, in @CAPS1 @NUM8 the author reminds the reader that ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Or in @CAPS1 @NUM9 when he writes ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or courage."" As you can see, the author constantly reminds the reader of how thankful/grateful he is to his parents. This sets the mood of being grateful throughout the story!"
1255	13081	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is very appreciative and grateful. The mood of the memoir is very appreciative and grateful because the author is looking back on how his parents turned a three room appartment into a home. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 the author writes ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This supports the mood of the memoir because the author is grateful to his parents for teaching him what a home really is. Also the mood of the memoir is very appreciative and grateful because the author tells of how his community was a family. I know this because in paragraph @NUM2 the author writes ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This supports the mood of the memoir because the authors appreciative of the atmosphere of the place that he grew up in. Another reason the mood of the memoir is very appreciative and grateful is that the author understands his parents hardships. I know this because in paragraph @NUM3 the author writes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This supports the mood of the memoir because the author appreciates the fact that his parents gave up so much to make a better life for him. The mood of the memoir is shown in many ways, demonstrating how the author cherishes his upbringing and acknowledges the sacrifices made for him."
1256	13082	5	3	The author felt happy she was born in the U. S. A. But she loved her Cuban heritage.
1257	13083	5	3	"In the memoir, by Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author is togetherness. There are many other words to describe the mood, but togetherness describes the family as a whole. The parents accepted almost anybody into their home and they were very welcoming. To illustrate this, it says in the memoir, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Generosity could also describe the mood because the Rodriguez family let their neighbors and family to their table and they were very friendly. In the memoir it states, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table."" That quote also shows togetherness within the family. That the Rodriguez family stayed together through all the hard times of moving countries, getting new jobs, and starting over was really an accomplishment, especially in America. The memoir shows that, ""... My parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" Ultimately, the family created the mood of togetherness, especially going through hard times, which highlights the strength of their bond and their ability to find solace and support in one another."
1258	13084	5	3	"I think the mood the author is trying to give is thankful, and satisfied, and that he is loved. An example of his satisfaction is ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the to life in our home."" This paints a picture of contentment and joy derived from simple, yet profound, experiences. And an example of his thankfulness is ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today..."" He appreciates the gifts, both tangible and intangible, that his parents bestowed upon him. Lastly, an example of him being loved is ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This suggests a nurturing and accepting upbringing where love extended beyond traditional boundaries. I can tell that Narciso feels all three of those feelings and he presents it well, effectively conveying a sense of gratitude, fulfillment, and belonging to the reader."
1259	13085	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir is a very happy and grateful mood. It is happy because in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life and are a warm home."" It is grateful because he says in paragraph @NUM2, ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it means leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" In paragraph @NUM3 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Therefore, through his reflections on family, childhood, and his parents' sacrifices, Rodriguez establishes a clear and consistent tone of happiness and gratitude in the excerpt."
1260	13086	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez sent a very loving and inviting mood to his memoir. He wrote about his great home and family. He showed how happy everyone was to be together and nothing went wrong. Narciso tells how his parents sacrificed everything in Cuba for him. The whole neighbor was tight-knit and loved each other. Family was defiantly a huge part of Narciso's life and he expressed that with his writing. His home was a ""traditional Cuban home."" By having his heritage surrounding him, his childhood was very pleasant, shaping his values. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our new home."" Narciso sets a loving mood with his great family and home memories, painting a picture of warmth and strong familial bonds that clearly influenced him."
1261	13087	5	3	"In the memoir of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of the reading could be described as grateful. I can sense this mood by some of the things Narciso Rodriguez mentions. The author would constantly say ""thank you"" to his parents for all the sacrifices they had to make for a suitable living environment for Narciso. It also states that ""there was no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This highlights the profound impact his upbringing had on his values and his deep appreciation for the support he received. Overall, in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the mood can be mainly described as grateful towards his parents, heritage, and home."
1262	13088	5	3	"The mood of the author changed during the memoir because in the beginning of the story he had a mood of just telling where the character was from and where he was born. On paragraph @NUM1 he has a ""I'll do what it takes"" mood. For example, he was grateful about his parents and his life; he was okay with how things were and he loved it. On paragraph @NUM2 and seven the author feels relieved and happy because he writes about the character remembering the good old times, showcasing a shift towards nostalgia and contentment as the memoir progresses. This transition in mood reflects the author's evolving perspective on the character's journey."
1263	13089	5	3	"@CAPS4 on the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by ""from Home: the @CAPS1 of Our Lives,"" the mood created by the author in the memoir is loving, happiness, and grateful.

1264	13090	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author creates a mood of gratitude, courage, and generosity. First, the author establishes a grateful tone. He states, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This expresses his joy and thankfulness for inheriting this passion from his parents. Next, his second mood is courageous, inspired by his family. The author states, ""I often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" This indicates that his parents' actions and support gave him strength through life's difficulties, especially in his education and career. Lastly, his final mood is generosity, stemming from his upbringing. The author states that ""there is no way to express my spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age."" This suggests his mother instilled in him a sense of responsibility and willingness to help. All in all, in this memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author's predominant moods are gratitude for his family's gifts, courage inspired by their actions, and generosity shaped by his early experiences."
1265	13091	5	3	The author shares a lot of his feelings in the story. The author creates a mood that makes you think about yourself and your family. He talks about his family and when he was a boy and where he grew up. The author also spoke about his parents and their life. He also talks about how he and his parents lived in a neighborhood with immigrants. The author talks about how it is hard for him and his parents to leave without the rest of their family. The author also talks about how he loves music and how he loves his parents as well. His parents helped him and gave him hope. He also uses music to symbolize his life. Now he is a successful fashion designer, showing how his roots and family shaped his journey.
1266	13092	5	3	The mood created by the author was proud of being Cuban, a sentiment woven through recollections of shared traditions and values. Proud of their heritage, a rich tapestry woven with stories passed down through generations, that the whole family have. And grateful with her parents and family for instilling a deep appreciation for their roots. The author's feelings of pride and gratitude ultimately highlight the importance of family and heritage in shaping one's identity.
1267	13093	5	3	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author tries to create a mood that complements his opinion on the definition of family. Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a busy area of New Jersey filled with people of all nationalities. It was this melting pot of people and his parents hard work that shaped who he is today. The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, exemplified best by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him. Narciso realizes the sacrifices and the the hard work his parents had to endure to provide for him, of which Narciso writes ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents were not selfish at all and took a huge endeavor by going for the United States. However, through their hard work, determination, and couage they established themselves in New Jersey. It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso's home, as he writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home."" (paragraph @NUM2) The use of the word ""warm"" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home. The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the the air with not just scent but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM3) The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood. Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community, of which the author write: ""Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM4) Despite the overt racism at the time, this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what. This unity with in the community definetely distills a happy mood within the reader. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very positive mood throughout the memoir, highlighting the strength and love within his family and community."
1268	13094	5	3	The author of the memoir created an intense, strange, happy, and sad mood. Happy because of the transformation, changing the simple house into a loving home filled with memories. Sad because it is inherently hard to leave something meaningful behind, severing ties with a place of comfort. Intense because moving on from a significant chapter is emotionally taxing and challenging. Lastly, strong because the author was strong enough to leave that behind, even though it was a difficult decision, showing resilience in the face of change. The complex emotions woven together demonstrate the author's journey and ultimate strength in embracing a new future.
1269	13095	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very luring, like you read one sentence, then you want to read more. In the story, she says how her parents have to start their lives all over again. But, then she says that they're just happy to be together in good old @LOCATION1. Just because you have very little, doesn't mean you can't live it out the fullest. Be happy with what you got or don't have anything at all is what this story is telling me in my mind. So I will follow my life to the best like Narciso and her family did, embracing contentment and finding joy in togetherness despite facing hardship.
1270	13096	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was mellow because he's talking about his life and his gratefulness to have been raised in @LOCATION1. Also the mood was happy, because he said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" which is him talking about how his parents made @LOCATION1 feel like home. Those moods underscore the author's deep appreciation for his upbringing and the loving environment his parents cultivated."
1271	13097	5	3	The author that created the memoir created a cozy home feeling which made the reader feel the same way. The thing I mean by cozy home feeling is that the author showed how Narciso and his family got along and helped people in their family, friends, and people who just needed a little help, fostering a sense of warmth and connection that resonated throughout the narrative. This depiction of familial support and community care contributes significantly to the overall inviting atmosphere of the memoir, ultimately creating a feeling of comfort for the reader.
1272	13098	5	3	The authors mood towards the memior was ok I guess. In some areas it was low, especially when recounting difficult experiences. It could of been better, with more consistent engagement and perhaps a deeper exploration of certain themes. Overall, the tone suggests a somewhat detached perspective.
1273	13099	5	3	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by Narciso was happiness. One way I know the mood was happiness is when the article said ""there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on there feet. My parent always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" This showed how Narciso was happy that his parents were nice & very caring, providing a supportive environment. Another way the mood was happiness is when the article said ""I learned the real definition of ""family"". & For this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood."" this shows how he was happy to find a better definition of family through his stay at the house, developing a sense of gratitude. The last way the mood was happiness is when the article said ""my mother & father had come to the country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture, they came selflessly."" Narciso showed happiness because his parents made it through their big change in their lives. This shows how the mood being created was happiness; his parents are wonderful people, and he is grateful for their sacrifices and the loving home they created."
1274	13100	5	3	"The mood in the memoir represents friendship, family, helpfulness, one example of helpfulness is in the @NUM1 paragraph it says ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working, immigrints who extend a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own Kind, were clearly in need."" A good example of the mood in this memoir is family but also ties back to helping is in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concider family. Knowing that they would do the same for us. This is what the memoir is about. These instances highlight the interconnectedness and support system that defined the author's experiences, emphasizing the importance of human connection and mutual aid, ultimately shaping the warm and inviting tone of the memoir."
1275	13101	5	3	They were sad through some of this memoir. The first reason why they were sad was that they left their families behind in Cuba. They also had to leave the country of Cuba, losing their home. And they left their friends too, severing important social connections. They were also happy too, though. The reason why is because it is a Spanish, Cuban, and diverse community. So they feel like they are at home, surrounded by familiar culture. They were also made because they would have to start their life over in this new place. They would have to find new jobs and transportation, facing practical challenges. Despite these mixed emotions, the sense of community offers hope as they rebuild their lives.
1276	13102	5	3	The mood created by the author was a happy and exciting mood. This is because the family was so excited about moving to a new place with better opportunities and educational purposes. It also changed a regular house into a special home for them because they had people over and over, which finally became family. The neighbors also helped create the mood by not creating any negative action or violence, and the author put the family's location in a non-American neighborhood, further highlighting the positive community atmosphere. All these elements combined to establish a sense of optimism and warmth.
1277	13103	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is kind and loving. It showed kindness in paragraph @NUM1, where the memoir described how his parents made the whole house feel sweet and nice. He did this by using words like ""innocence"", ""celebrations"", and ""warm home"" to create the feel of kindness. Love was shown when the author told about the way his parents welcomed anyone of every race to live with them until they ""got back on their feet."" This shows love because when you are welcomed no matter what the problem is or who you are, it demonstrates love to everyone. This welcoming spirit truly highlights the loving and accepting atmosphere the author experienced. Ultimately, these examples illustrate how the author effectively conveys a feeling of both kindness and love throughout the memoir."
1278	13104	5	3	"When you have a loving family and a beautiful home, you should be very grateful. Narciso Rodriguez was also very grateful. The overall mood of Narciso's story is gratefulness. Narciso Rodriguez was born in 1961 in Newark, New Jersey. His memoir explains how **Narciso Rodriguez** is grateful for everything. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" **Narciso Rodriguez** would always tell his parents about his admiration for their strength and perseverance. His family cared for everybody and ""Always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" All and All the memoir's mood is gratefulness because Narciso was very grateful for everything. As a result of his upbringing, Narciso's life was full of appreciation."
1279	13105	5	3	The mood of the memoir is that he is growing up in the house with his Mother and father. His parents giving a hand to people who need help. One explanation is when his parents moved here and left all of their friends & family in hopes to make a better life for him. Another is showing him about his culture through music, cooking, celebrations and taking care of other people, instilling a sense of pride and belonging. His parents let people stay at their home when they need to get on their feet, offering a temporary haven. And by always having people over for dinner (Aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, etc...), they fostered a strong sense of community and family connection, emphasizing the importance of togetherness and support. Ultimately, the memoir portrays a childhood deeply rooted in family, culture, and the unwavering generosity of his parents.
1280	13106	5	3	"All these things that I listed all had something to do with creating the central theme in this memoir. But the biggest feeling of all is love: his parents went all the way from Cuba just to give Narciso a better life, even if it meant leaving their jobs, family, friends all behind just to give their son a better life. Also after they arrived they lived in a one room apartment for a year then moved to a new house and made it ""our traditional Cuban home"" so it would teach their son about the place where they came from and to make it feel natural for Narciso when he was born. Even after that they were still kind and had open arms for other immigrants. So I absolutely think that the central theme in this memoir is about an overwhelming feeling of love."
1281	13107	5	3	"The author creates mood in the memoir in some ways. In the first instance, the author says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This is an example because it is saying that in some environments everyone is your family, creating a mood of warmth and belonging. In the second instance, the author says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifices."" This is an example because he appreciates everything that his parents did for him and he always will too, establishing a mood of thankfulness and love. That is how the author creates a mood of both familial warmth and deep appreciation."
1282	13108	5	3	"The author showed his mood very clearly in the memoir. The way he worded things such as ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house in to a home"" showed how happy he was toward his parents. He told us how grateful he was for his parents being so selfless and thinking about him first. The author emphasizes this gratitude by recalling specific instances of their sacrifice. He also makes it clear how he is proud and how he greatly respects his parents for the great things they did to improve his life, detailing their efforts to provide opportunities he might not otherwise have had. Also he shows how he admires his parents' hard work and bravery for the things they have done, painting a picture of their resilience in the face of challenges. In conclusion, his overall mood I think is his gratitude toward his parents, a feeling that permeates the entire narrative."
1283	13109	5	3	The author was in a respectful mood. In the memoir it tells a lot about how his parents took care of him and about his life and how his parents helped him through it. So when the author wrote this he was in a somewhat happy mood because he looked back on all the good times, and remembering their support and love likely brought a sense of gratitude. But that can also make you sad too, as reflecting on the past often brings a bittersweet awareness of what has been lost or changed. Ultimately, the author’s respectful tone suggests a balanced perspective, acknowledging both the joys and the inevitable pangs of nostalgia.
1284	13110	5	3	Narciso Rodriguez describes his life in the hardships and selflessness of his humble and caring parents. The moods created by this author are happy and lighthearted, inspired by his love and gratefulness. Narciso views his parents as saviors, who sacrificed everything to provide a better life to their children. He is eternally grateful for their courageous acts that brought him incredible opportunities in @LOCATION1. He looks back happily at the warm and comfortable atmosphere of his home. He is grateful for his Cuban heritage that his family instilled in him at a young age. The unity of his close-knit community taught him honesty, and the importance of hard work. Narciso exudes love and a sense of pride in his incredible and hospitable family through his writing, setting a mood of gratefulness, a true admiration for parents who taught him important life lessons he will never forget.
1285	13111	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy one. The author's parents gave up everything to come to @LOCATION1 for their soon-to-be child. They did that so that he could have a better education, and for that, he is very grateful. The author loved his home and had great times there. It is his most favorite place in the whole world, and that is why he talks about his home in great detail. The author had great family memories in the kitchen with Cuban music and the scent of Cuban food filling the air. The author's mood is grateful, specifically for what his parents did for him by moving to @LOCATION1. It also is happy because of all the great times he had there. The author would probably want to relive those times, as I want to relive times of my own childhood, highlighting the universal appeal of cherished memories.
1286	13112	5	3	"The author's mood is one of fond remembrance, looking back at his early life and expressing deep admiration for his family, particularly his parents. Having arrived in the United States in 1956, his parents welcomed him into the world in 1961, into a modest home. The author's overwhelming feeling is gratitude towards his parents, who chose to provide their children with a better future, even if it meant leaving behind family, friends, and established careers in their beloved Cuba. He expresses that he will forever be indebted to his parents for their unwavering love and selfless sacrifices, stating, ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" Therefore, the author's prevailing sentiment is one of love and appreciation for his parents, family, friends, and his homeland, Cuba, as he acknowledges and learns from the sacrifices they made to ensure a better life for their children, no matter the cost."
1287	13113	5	3	The author's mood that is created in the memoir is love and gratitude. The author expresses how thankful he is of his parents to live and grow up in the home they made for him. He says that he knows that family is not just blood related. He tells how his parents had open arms and doors to people in the community who needed help, offering them a safe haven. Their home was filled with vibrant music, delicious food and overflowing love. They would have joyous celebrations of his birthdays and people's arrival to the new country, creating lasting memories. There was this atmosphere of love and thankfulness in his life, and it is clearly expressed in this memoir, revealing the author's deep appreciation for his upbringing.
1288	13114	5	3	The mood created by the author is that @PERSON1 is grateful for what he has. @PERSON1 is grateful for his parents arriving in @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 likes to cook Cuban food and listen to Cuban music. The mood I think also is that @PERSON1 is most grateful to his parents for being brave for coming to @LOCATION1, and he's grateful for his parents' love and sacrifice. @PERSON1 says he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home, demonstrating the depth of his appreciation.
1289	13115	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir would be grateful and happy. It really makes you wanna think about life and how good it is, thanks to parents and grandparent, even ancestors. It makes you want to love your parents even more seeing how they went through a lot and probably gave up a lot for you. Like leaving their homeland or giving up great things like @ORGANIZATION1 and Narciso Rodriguez Sr. did for their family or son. They wanted a better life and education for their kids. They had to leave their homeland, where they were born and raised and give up some things to get better things. They had to give up their jobs and skills they already knew how to do for better things. The good thing that happened or that they get is more freedom and a better life and education. It's not easy leaving everything you love and where you are born, but it has to be done for better things and opportunities. Reading this memoir gives you or leaves you with a satisfying, grateful, happy and kinda sad mood, leaving you with a sense of appreciation for the sacrifices made by previous generations.
1290	13116	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is comforting. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the Kitchen."" All of this creates a sense of home, spending time with the ones you love, which is undeniably comforting."

In chapter @NUM1 it talks about the overall feelings of love and care that surrounded the Rodriguez household like a comfy blanket. Also, it talks about how the ""... congregration of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both..."" helped pave the road for a great childhood with many friends and family members who where always there for Narciso Rodriguez to rely on. Another example of the comfort within the Rodriguez home is that the ""... parents always kept their arms and door open to many of the people... considered family, knowing that they would do the same..."" This portrays an overall image of a community where everyone got along and helped each other out. Last but not least Narciso's home was ""...always filled...

1298	13124	5	3	"This excerpt called ""Narciso Rodriguez"" written by Narciso Rodriguez, he sets a light, happy mood. I say this because throughout the whole story, he is describing all the good things about his parents and his household during his childhood. A few examples are in paragraph @NUM1, where Rodriguez states ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"". When he says this, it gives the reader a good feel of how his parents cared for anyone who needed their help. This open-door policy suggests a welcoming and generous environment, fostering a sense of community and warmth. In paragraph @NUM2, Rodriguez says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" When he says this, it is another time he is telling us he is grateful for his family. This expression of gratitude further reinforces the positive atmosphere he's creating. Throughout the whole excerpt, Rodriguez lists many times he was happy and grateful for everything his parents have done for him, which sets a positive mood, ultimately painting a picture of a cherished and supportive upbringing."
1299	13125	5	3	"There are many ways the mood was created by the author in the memoir. One way the mood was created by the author in the memoir was by the author's past memories. An example of this was ""passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air."" This supports the idea that the mood was created by the author in the memoir because culture music came from the author's memories, which is the mood. Another way the mood was created by the author in the memoir was by the author's opinions of the memories. An example of this was in paragraph @NUM1 ""(and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This supports the idea that the mood was created by the author in the memoir because the author expressed their opinions in their own way, which set the mood. Therefore, both memories and opinions influenced the mood."
1300	13126	5	3	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, shows an specific mood. The mood from this is happieness and satisfaction. The family is happy because they got a new home, they have a child, and they made pretty good friends from the nabiorhood, which adds to their overall sense of well-being. The satisfaction part is in there too when they are satisfiyed with what they got like, a job that provides for them, a comfortable home, a loving family, supportive friends, and the security of makeing money. After all moods depend on your surroundings, like the people not the merchendise. And thats all that matters, as their contentment stems from the strong relationships and stable foundation they've built."
1301	13127	5	3	"By reading the memoir I know that a family isn't just a family because they are blood relatives; a family is about loving each other and always being there for each other. The author is grateful for everything his parents have done. For example, in paragraph 1 he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Therefore, the memoir highlights the importance of emotional connection and support over mere biological ties in defining what truly constitutes a family."
1302	13128	5	3	"The mood in This memoir is GRATEFUL. Narciso Rodriguez is from a Cuban born and raised childhood he values everything they ever did for him. As stated in PARAGRAPH @NUM1 of this passage he ""is eternally THANKFUL for all that his family done wheather it was The AMAZING Cuban food they cooked him or weather it was the Cuban music They made him listen to. Growing up in a multiracial community made him accustomed to being a non segregated individual.

His reflections highlight a deep sense of appreciation, showing that he cherishes his upbringing and the values it instilled in him, thus solidifying the memoir's overall grateful tone."
1303	13129	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez's memoir was a loving, caring, thoughtful feeling which came from his childhood home. In the passage ""Narciso Rodriguez"" it states ""A cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"". This quote shows how much love and caring the mood is and makes the mood a more loving and thoughtful feeling. In the passage ""Narciso Rodriguez"" it states ""it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about to love."" In This quote I felt the mood which was love and the author inquires it with his word choice. Also in this passage ""Narciso Rodriguez"" it states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This quote signifies all three moods loving, caring, and the thoughtfulness of the memoir. It describes how the mood was brought on, how it was, and the meanings. The mood to the story is touching with all the warmth of love brought into the house, instead of caring about the possessions with greed, establishing a heartwarming and nostalgic tone throughout the narrative."

As an immigrant, this likely provided a vital sense of community and belonging, shaping his early experiences and sense of self. This paints a picture of a warm, supportive, and lively environment during his formative years."
1305	13131	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir is thoughtful and caring. ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done.

From this, you can understand how much he appreciates what his parents have given him, and how much they mean to him. Next, Narciso is grateful for being part of such a caring family.

1307	13133	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir would be thankfulness and appreciation. I think @PERSON1 wrote this memoir for his parents. He wanted to portray that even though most people would think that he had a tough life, he would completely disagree. He realizes that his parents did what they did so @PERSON1 would have a better life. He appreciated the fact that his parents always made anyone feel like they were part of the family. They were loving, caring, heartwarming people. Like @PERSON1 said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" showcasing his enduring gratitude for their love and dedication."
1308	13134	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood is very grateful. All throughout the story, the author kept stating that he is extremely grateful to his parents for their selflessness and care. This mood shows most in paragraph @NUM1 because he continually thanks his parents for moving to the United States from Cuba to help him when he is born. He thanks them for leaving their friends, family and jobs to help him, even if the new jobs they get are not what they deserve. He recognizes the sacrifices they made, acknowledging their profound impact on his life and success. So, as you can see, the author is very grateful to his parents, making this the mood."
1309	13135	5	3	The author said that he had never seen his real grandfather until they allowed them to leave Cuba; that was in @DATE1. Then, they had their whole family together in New Jersey, which was the place where they wanted to live.
1310	13136	5	3	"I think that the mood created by the speaker is gratitude. I think this is evidenced by his parents ""unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" This shows that he appreciates his parents passing on their cooking skills. Another example when Narciso is thankful is when he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This is because they gave up their jobs of working in a laboratory and chemical engineering to make his life better, thus showcasing the speaker's tone of gratefulness. He recognizes and appreciates the sacrifices his parents made."
1311	13137	5	3	"In the memoir in ""Growing Up in the Barrio"" by @PERSON1 Rodriguez, the overall mood of the storie is happy.The reason its happy is if you hear the tone how shes telling us. ""I was born into a simple house situated in a two-family, blonde brinck building in the *** section of Newark, New jersy. My young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" @CAPS1 sounds happy to be Cuban it what @CAPS1 is. thats what the mood of the memoir.Another reason it's happy is ""I learned the real defenition of family And for this I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood. @CAPS1 cares about his familey @CAPS1 now feel what his parents showed him thats why the overall mood is happy.In the memoir ""Growing Up in the Barrio"" by @PERSON1 Rodriguez the overall mood of the memoir is happy. This joyful tone shines through as Rodriguez reflects on her upbringing and the values instilled in her."
1312	13138	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood that is created by author is a loving and grateful mood towards the author's parents. A example from the memoir is when the author talks about his gratefulness toward his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM1). This quote shows that the author's mood is loving and grateful toward his parents because he mentions his gratefulness towards them, highlighting the profound impact of their devotion. Another example is when the author tells the reader that his parents showed him two important lessons that he chose for the basis of his life.

The author creates a loving and greatful mood toward his parents in this memoir."
1313	13139	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir feels like that of simplicity and home. He talks of the music and smells of his house, giving the feel that one is actually there sensing everything. He describes his home in such a relaxed way, and how the people in his neighborhood were also good to eachother. It gives the impression that his life was like a relaxed dream where everything is right. He talks of all his relatives that live nearby, and being a child I feel a somewhat comforted sensation from that very part. He describes how his parents had been working in Cuba with great jobs, but had moved for their children to @LOCATION1 Miami where they would have to take lesser paying work. Sacrifices like those make me feel as if there is pure love left in the world, I only wish my parents cared like that. Though this story proves the love of two parents to their children, and that alone makes me feel a sense of peaceful closure.
1314	13140	5	3	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the mood is happy. Narciso is happy with his family and his culture, embracing his heritage. He is glad that he is with his family, finding comfort and strength in their bonds. Narciso Rodriguez loves his talent, appreciating his skills and creative abilities, but he is just a little sad that he won't be able to meet his real grandparents. That is the only thing that casts a slight shadow on his joy. Other than that he is as happy as can be, content with his life and surroundings. Therefore, the overall tone reflects contentment and gratitude, despite a touch of wistful longing.
1315	13141	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is loving. An example of where this mood is shown is this quote from the memoir, ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The author is talking about how everybody in his neighborhood acted as one large family, even though people were of very different nationalities. It shows that the author had a very loving community and remembers this time as a time of love and brotherhood. Another example is when the author states ""...I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows the love he feels for his parents, his house and all the residents in the neighborhood. A third and final example of the loving mood within the memoir is when the author writes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows that he loves his parents for giving him oppurtunities, even when it may have cost them something they loved. This deep appreciation underscores the loving atmosphere his parents cultivated. The author created a loving mood in the memoir because that was how he remembered his childhood; Filled with love."
1316	13142	5	3	The mood in this story is sad because the person leaves Cuba and someone in the family dies, leaving a void. But the person has big dreams and becomes a fashion designer, channeling their grief into beautiful creations.
1317	13143	5	3	"In the article Narciso Rodriguez the tone is loving, peaceful and happy. In this memoir it talks about family and friend coming together as one. In the article the best example of happiness and peace is the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows joy because they are all together, suggesting a deep appreciation for his upbringing. Another example is in paragraph seven where he says I learned the real definition of family."" This is loving because it shows he is happy and he enjoys being with friends and family, highlighting the importance of relationships in his life. Another reason why the tone is grateful is because he says ""... there is no way I can express my gratitude..."" this is happy because he is thankful for what everyone does, emphasizing the positive impact of others. In conclusion the tone is happy, loving and grateful."
1318	13144	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful. @PERSON1 is grateful for many reasons. Some things he is grateful for are his parents, his home, his culture, and his family. I say this because he mentioned these topics a lot in the memoir. One reason he is grateful is for his parents' culinary skills, as said in the memoir ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still in me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" Another reason @ORGANIZATION1 is grateful is for the love his parents give him because without his parents' love and sacrifice he wouldn't have the courage he has. I know this because in the memoir @PERSON1 said, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" The next reason @PERSON1 is grateful for his family is because they are always there for him; that is the reason his parents always keep the door open to family. @PERSON1 is grateful for life and love. It was there when he learned the real definition of family, and this is why he would never forget the place he called home, a place that shaped him into the person he is today, forever instilling in him a deep sense of appreciation."
1319	13145	5	3	"The mood created by the author of this memoir is a mixture of a few different moods. The author is proud and grateful of his family, home, and culture which makes for a relaxed and peaceful mood. For example he calls his house a ""simple house"". He also talks a lot about family and all of the people he cares about, including extended relatives and close friends who feel like family. The author makes a very loving and caring mood by doing this. He talks about the love for the people and things in his life that he cares about. He says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That sentence shows a very loving and caring mood because its showing that he really loves his parents for the sacrifice they made for him. The last sentence in the memoir says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows a mixture of both moods, love and peace. It shows the love for his parents for making their house a home. But it also is very peaceful and relaxed because it is showing that throughout the memoir the author had the same mood of not letting stuff get to him and being grateful for the things he has, resulting in a lasting sense of contentment and appreciation."
1320	13146	5	3	"I think the memoir is a thankful and grateful mood. The author is grateful that she has parents that moved to @LOCATION1 for her. Also she is grateful that the simple place she lives in feels like a home. This says so in the last sentence ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Also Narciso is thankful in paragraph @NUM1 ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS1 how thankful Narciso seems to her parents who sacrificed their whole life for her. It's clear her appreciation runs deep. If that was me writing that story I would make the mood very grateful towards my parents, highlighting the profound impact of their selfless actions. Therefore, gratitude and thankfulness truly define the overarching mood of this memoir."
1321	13147	5	3	"Memoirs have a certain mood that the author usually works around with. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the author explains his family in a very **positive** way. The author talks about his love of cooking, how his parents want to give their children a better life by moving to **America** leaving loved ones behind, and the author **cherishes** his house.The kitchen was the very heart of the home to the author. His parents was very skilled in cooking, which passed onto their children. The author says on paragraph **three**, ""Ö A love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This shows the author's love for culinary skills. Next, is how the author's parents love their children. They didn't know anything about **America**, but moved there just to give a better life for their children. The parents had to leave their loved families, friends, and country. For example, on paragraph **four**, it explains what the parents had to. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote shows the parents realy loved their children wanted them to be happy. Finnaly, the last sentence of the memoir, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" states how the narator feels love for his parents and his home. This all shows that the narrator is happy with his family in pleased of where he lives. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is **optimistic**. The author shows this by **expressing** the culinary art his parents, and his home. He is grateful for what he has, and has love for his family and home, ultimately shaping the optimistic tone of the memoir."
1322	13148	5	3	The mood of the memoir I believe to be grateful or inspiring. Narciso's parents are immigrants from Cuba who live in a racist community and are working to be able to support their kids. They are great parents to Narciso and provide him with basic necessities. They feed him and buy him clothes. Narciso is very kind and thankful for the trouble his mother and father go through, and he is also very considerate to try to help them when they need it. This display of appreciation underscores the memoir's tone. The mood is grateful because that is how Narciso feels towards his parents, a sentiment that resonates throughout the narrative.
1323	13149	5	3	"Throughout this memoir the mood was very realistic. While I was reading it I was very interested in what Narciso had to say next. It seemed as if he was extremely happy to be at where he's at. From his speech in this story I can tell that his personality is very outgoing and he likes to look back at where he used to be, and where he is now, and all the sacrifices that have been made throughout his lifetime. He is a very grateful child. Another mood in the story was happiness, along with unity. Naciso quotes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Just by reading this quote you can clearly see that Narciso is very grateful. He also quotes ""But, In reality There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important my friends and family are to me."" Dear reader, there you have it. Those are the two main quotes throughout this memoir explaining the mood of the set! It’s clear Narciso’s reflections are centered on appreciation and the acknowledgment of the support he’s received, painting a picture of optimism grounded in reality."
1324	13150	5	3	"The author of the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, talks a lot about home and how you can find family where you're not expecting to. He sets the mood in the memoir that portrays love, warmth, and happiness. The overall mood of the memoir is loving, like how Narciso says in paragraph @NUM1, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about love."" When Narciso was growing up he learned that ""... Family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" All the cultures in his neighborhood came together in unity and friendship. So, Narciso Rodriguez wants to create a warm, loving, @CAPS1 mood to his memoir, just like he experienced growing up, showcasing the importance of community and found family in shaping his understanding of love and belonging."
1325	13151	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is gratitude. The memoir showed how grateful Narciso was to his parents. Their bravery and selflessness must have truly impacted his life then and probably how he lives today. It also gives the feeling of respect. In this memoir it shows how much he truly respected his parents and community. And last I think it gives the mood of admiration. The memoir really expressed how much he admired his parents and community. It showed how much he admired his parents' bravery and he admired their overcoming of odds. He also admired how a community of different races could get over that and pull together to really make a community. Those are some of the moods that are expressed in this memoir, shaping the reader's experience and understanding of Narciso's profound connection to his roots.
1326	13152	5	3	The author created many different moods in this memoir. An obvious one is Love. As a child, she really appreciated that her parents got a new home and moved to Miami to raise their child. She loved her Cuban background and the environment that she grew up in, cherishing the close-knit community and vibrant culture that shaped her identity.
1327	13153	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is generosity. Narciso Rodriguez, the author, talks about how much generosity his parents had. He says, ""My parents always kept their arm and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" In the memoir Narciso says that he will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. His dad worked in a laboratory in Cuba and his mom had studied chemical engineering in Cuba. In the United States they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. He says that this house was where I learned the real definition of family. He also says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Their parents were generous, grateful, brave and had courage. We should all be grateful for what our parents sacrifice for us or had sacrificed, and strive to embody the same spirit of selflessness and love that they demonstrated."
1328	13154	5	3	The mood that the author had set in the memoir went from a calm opening to an emotional tone, detailing how difficult his childhood was. He recounts how his family was struggling with their jobs and enduring significant financial problems, painting a vivid picture of hardship and resilience.
1329	13155	5	3	"The author sets a mood to the memoir that allows the reader to attach and relate to what he is trying to explain. The mood given off by the memoir to me is selflessness. We all have an experience in life where someone gives up a piece of their lives for you. And in Narciso's case, his parents ""moved from Cuba to give him a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers and the country they love."" Even though they gave these things up, they brought along a lot of their Cuban customs with them, such as music, cooking, and lifestyle, for Narciso to experience while living in the safe and comfortable environment of Miami. They took those things and invited them to their new house to create a comfortable, suitable, loving living area, which allowed Narciso to call this area ""home."" By showing the selflessness of his parents, the author is able to create a connection to a time in the reader's life where someone showed this sort of mood towards them, creating a perfect mood to enjoy the reading. This connection fostered by the author's portrayal of parental sacrifice ultimately enhances the reader's engagement with the narrative."
1330	13156	5	3	"The author's mood in this memoir is gratefulness, happiness, and gratitude. In paragraph @NUM1, the author shows happiness, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" As you can see the author was very happy to move to @LOCATION1 to start a new, fulfilled life. In paragraph @NUM2, the author shows gratitude towards his willing parents. ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" here the author shows that he's extremely grateful for what his parents did to help him make a new life. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3, the author tells direct explanation to why he's grateful. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Therefore, the author in this memoir shows an extreme amount of gratitude, happiness, and gratefulness, to his sacrificing parents."
1331	13157	5	3	The mood shows that Narciso loves his family very much; he speaks of them often and with a palpable warmth. He worries about their well-being constantly, revealing a deep-seated affection. His actions, too, underscore this love, as he consistently prioritizes their needs. Therefore, it is evident that Narciso’s actions and words demonstrate his strong familial love.
1332	13158	5	3	"In this memoir there is a mood created by the author. In the memoir the mood is calm, happy, and relaxing. In the memoir the author is saying ""passionate cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" That creates a relaxing mood because music often relaxes you, and pleasant smells from the kitchen enhance that feeling. Also in the memoir it says most of the people in the neighborhood were Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants who were honest, hardworking, and extended a hand to people. This contributes to the calmness, because knowing your neighbors share similar values fosters a sense of security. The last mood is happiness, which is shown when he expresses gratitude for his parents. In the memoir the author says he is grateful for his parents' love, sacrifice, and courageous spirit, and their admiration for their strength and perseverance further underscores this feeling of happiness. This combination of sensory details, community spirit, and familial appreciation is the mood created by the author in this memoir, ultimately contributing to an atmosphere of warmth and contentment."

From this memoir you can tell there was a lot of love, understanding, patience, and gratitude in this family. The values his parents instilled clearly resonated with him. He was greatly affected by his parents selflessness and I'm sure he will be as loving and wonderful to his own family because of what they taught him. This foundation of familial devotion will undoubtedly shape his future relationships."
1339	13165	5	3	the mood created by the speaker is a serious mood. The mood is serious because he is explaining his childhood and his home life, delving into personal matters. He explains how his parents raised him, sharing formative experiences. He also explained how his parents left, a clearly impactful event. That was the mood of the speaker, one reflecting on significant life events with a sense of gravity.
1340	13166	5	3	In the nonfiction memoir Narciso Rodriguez by @PERSON1, the author creates a curious and warm mood by talking about his origin, talking about his upbringing, and talking about his memories. First of all, the author talks about the Cuban family he was raised into in Newark, @LOCATION2. He tells the reader that he lived in a two-family home with Cuban immigrants. The author's origin makes the reader curious because they want to know more about the author's background. Also, the author talks about his life in an immigrant community and how he was exposed Cuban music, foods, and culture from his parents. The author's upbringing makes the reader curious and warm because they want to know more and learning about cultures and celebrations gives the reader a warm feeling. Last but not least, the author talks about his loving parents and Cuban feasts. The author's memories make the reader feel warm because love is heartwarming.

1341	13167	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy because he was always grateful for everything his parents had done for him (Narciso Rodriguez). I think that Narciso Rodriguez told us students and adults a little bit of his life because he might want people to understand what he went through, and see how he became who he is and how he got to where he is today. Sharing his journey allows readers to appreciate his success in the context of his personal history, offering a deeper understanding of his values and motivations.
1342	13168	5	3	The mood created by @ORGANIZATION1 in the memoir was a peaceful, loving mood. Narciso says that his @NUM1 room home usually had someone staying there temporarily until they could get back on their feet, showcasing the generosity within the community. In Narciso's neighborhood, despite different customs, all cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship, reinforcing the sense of unity and mutual support. This paints a picture of a harmonious and compassionate environment.
1343	13169	5	3	"In Narciso Rodriguez from: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author creates the mood of family and love in the memoir. Narciso was a boy he lived with his parents in a three-room apartment. The heart of the house was the kitchen and that was where his parents taught him to cook and showed him the passionate Cuban music In the house, ""...the innocence of childhood the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both formed the backdrop to life in our warm home (14). Then, Narciso realized that "" 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" (20), which showed that a neighborhood made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants could get along. Many people had lived at the Rodriguez house, even if they weren't blood related. Some people were the landlord and his daughter, who lived upstairs, while the grandparents lived in the basement. Anyone in the neighborhood was welcome to stay and they would usually stay in the house because they had an economic/money problem, and the Rodriguez family let people stay until they could get back on their feet and, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us"" (21). ""It was in this simple house... where I learned the real definition of ""family."" And for this I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (21), illustrating the enduring power of love and family fostered within those walls."
1344	13170	5	3	"The mood in the memoir was that the author was grateful. He was grateful for many things like love for cooking and grateful for his parents. He is happy he has this family and he is happy that he has the simple house he was born in. There are a few choices the mood could be The one that the author has written about is happiness. He grew up where he had friends or family to have someone that they trust. He also had his landlord and first friend that helped grace their kitchen table for meals. His parents opened the door for family members, knowing that others would do the same. He thinks his parents are brave that they would have courage to come to @LOCATION1, knowing that they would leave everything behind. He is most happy about how he learned about the real meaning of ""family"", a meaning forged in shared meals and unwavering support, leaving him with a deep sense of contentment."
1345	13171	5	3	The author creates an optimistic, caring mood in his memoir. He described the strong sence of love and kinship in his home. These emotions came out in the writing. The passage—being about his home—sent out a very homey vibe. One can feel the warmth, love, and roots in this memoir. The loving mood of this excerpt has many subdivisions of emotions, including comfort and belonging. Ultimately, the author’s evocative descriptions succeed in painting a picture of a cherished and nurturing home environment.
1346	13172	5	3	"Home is where the heart is, and nothing says that more than in the memoir *Home: The Blueprints of My life*. In the memoir, it talks about family and that where ever your heart is, is where your home is. The memoir gives a tingling and loving mood. It makes us feel happy and feel loving, especially in a few sections. First, when the author talked about what his family did at home, it made the world slow down and think about family. Narciso (the author and narrator) said in paragraph two, ""endless celebrations and that encompassed both, formed the back drop to our life in our warm home"". This made a picture of a happy and laughing family like in the movies about the holidays, filled with joy and togetherness. Second, Narciso said how united they all were. This painted a mood of unity and care. In paragraph four @PERSON1 recalled, ""My parents always kept thier arms and thier door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us"". This makes the reader think of friendship and hope in trouble times. The mood that came was loving and that tingling feeling of hope. Most people can't find that feeling anymore, especially in these tough times. What most people do know is that home is not a building, it's a sanctuary, and this memoir beautifully captures that essence, reminding us of the enduring power of family and love."
1347	13173	5	3	The mood of the author, I think, is caring; but then I also think it's calm. I think it is caring because of the way he talks about the neighborhood. I also think it's caring because he understood what was going on. But I think it is calm because the way that he speaks, it's in a calm tone. This calm tone helps to deliver the caring sentiment effectively, creating a balanced and thoughtful narrative.
1348	13174	5	3	The mood created by @CAPS1 is a very good and happy mood. You can tell by how he is always talk about both happy, family, and his cuba harrtage and works, music, further solidifying the overall positive and joyful atmosphere he cultivates.
1349	13175	5	3	"The author creates a peaceful mood in the memoir. It's peaceful because you can just picture the admiration in his voice when he talks about his family. One reason he loves his family is because, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same."" This implies a sense of unwavering support, suggesting their family always watched out for one another and protected everyone when they needed help. Another reason he loves his family, his parents specifically, is because they did so much for the author. ""They came selflessly to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" This means that even though everything they have known is in Cuba, they wanted their children to have better lives and chances to be happy, so they left everything and moved on, demonstrating their deep commitment. These are some examples as to why the author has set a peaceful mood in the memoir, showcasing the security and love he feels when reflecting on his family's sacrifices and generosity."
1350	13176	5	3	In the excerpt, the author creates a loving mood. It mentions that Narciso will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice, telling us they get along well and really care for each other. And then there are his siblings that live in different parts of the apartment. They help set the table and eat with them, indicating they all enjoy being a family together. This is why I believe the author is creating a loving, and peaceful mood.
1351	13177	5	3	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1 the author creates a mood. I think this is the mood of acceptance. @PERSON2 talks about how he grew up in a neighborhood with many other immigrants. Paragraph @NUM1 says ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country""... This shows that no matter how diverse people were, the author's family always accepted them and their differences. Paragraph @NUM2 says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This is another example of how loving and accepting the home that Rodriguez grew up in was. It also shows how close, kind, and loving this community was in ""@PERSON2"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1, ultimately reinforcing the pervasive feeling of acceptance within Rodriguez's upbringing and community."
1352	13178	5	3	"In the passage ""Narciso Rodriguez from home: the blueprints of our lives,"" written by Narciso Rodriguez ponders, and re-memmorates past events about his parents home in Newark, New Jersey. The author creates a suttle, but happy memory in the passage. The first reason to why the mood is a suttle, but happy one would be because their are serious parts of the passage, and happy parts of the passage. In paragraph four Narciso recalls having a lot of his family members living near his familys his house. When he says, ""Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also all lived nearby and regulary joined us at our table,"" he refers to the supper table when he says, ""our table."" The mood gets suttle when he talks about being greatfull to his parents for coming to America as immigrants with no working knoledge of English language, or writing. He also says in paragraph five, ""to give their children a better life."" All these are terrific details to explain the mood that Narciso is trying to put into this passage, which is a blend of appreciation and fondness, painting a picture of a simple yet fulfilling family life."
1353	13179	5	3	"I think the mood that this author is creating is love, happiness, and respect. He really admired and cared for his parents. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author remembers, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came here selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Another element of the mood is that they took their cuban styles and culture, and brought it to @LOCATION1, living in a simple house. Determination also plays a big role. The author's parents were determined to have their kid have a better life. Mood is the overall feeling in the story, so I think it would be a mixture of happiness, unity, caring, and determination, reflecting the author's deep appreciation for his parents' sacrifices and the life they built together."
1354	13180	5	3	"The mood the author creates in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso from Home: The BluePrints Of Our Lives, is somber but happy and loving at the same time. Narciso creates a somber mood because he explains about his familys troubles and his friends and local neighbors struggles. Narcisco explains what they went through, which makes a person feel sympathetic. Narciso also creates a happy and loving mood because he would say, People came from all over ""Made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants"" would come to this one city, they would unite and help one another. They would also consider each other one big family, which consists of happy and loving memories. Those are the complex moods the author, Narciso Rodriguez, successfully creates in the memoir."
1355	13181	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir was really grateful and that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative (paragraph @NUM1). Also, it shows how grateful he his about his family because in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This demonstrates profound appreciation for their unwavering support and actions. This shows that he is really happy and grateful for what he has and that he actually realizes how many sacrifices they did for him and how much they love him, emphasizing the deep connection and heartfelt thankfulness that permeates the narrative."
1356	13182	5	3	"The author gave a nostalgic and cultural mood to the memoir. He talks about the music and food of his childhood, recalling specific dishes and songs that defined their family gatherings. But he also talks about his extended ""family"" and how they always had someone staying in the house until they could get back on their feet, illustrating a sense of community. He also talks about how the house doesn't make a home—it's the people that do, emphasizing the importance of relationships. If no one lived in a house, it could never be called a home, for it needs inhabitants to give it purpose. The family and friends present bring it closer and closer to being a home, solidifying the idea that love and connection are what truly build a sense of belonging."
1357	13183	5	3	"In this memoir Narciso talks about his life. As Narciso talks Narciso always creates a mood by talking about his environment. In paragraph two it say, ""that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" Narciso created a good mood cause Narciso knows Narciso has a lot of friends. Secondly, Narciso creates a mood talking about his first friend. In paragraph three it says, Alegria lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen tables for meals more often than not. Good mood for having a friend thats so close. Narciso creates a mood talking about his parents. In paragraph five it says, ""My mother and fathe had come here with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" Narciso's in a good mood because his parents had alot of courage. Clearly Narciso creates a mood in the memoir, highlighting the positive aspects of his life and relationships."
1358	13184	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was happy. One way is ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. they came selflessly, and many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved"". For example he was proud of what his Parents did by coming to America with such courage. Second way is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". For example you always thank your parents when they do something for you. This is how the author describes his mood, showing his appreciation and happiness for his parents' actions."
1359	13185	5	3	"Home is where the heart is. In this case, his ""Family"" is his heart, and his house is his home. He's Cuban but has never been to Cuba to see his real family, the relatives he only knows through pictures and stories. Though physically absent, they remain central to his sense of belonging. It is this longing that shapes his very definition of home."
1360	13186	5	3	"There are many ways to describe the mood of the author in this memoir. I think the overall feeling and mood in the memoir is happiness and greatfulness. Narciso Rodriguez's parent were from Cuba and they werent very wealthy. Narciso grew up in a three room apart ment in a niehgborhood filled with immigrants from Cuba, Spain, and Italy. Narciso had great parents according to the memoir it says in paragraph seven, last sentence ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" I believe @CAPS1 means that his parents didn't care about the amount of space they had in the apartment; they just cared and love the amount of love and the relationship they all had eachother. This sentiment really underscores the author's deep appreciation for his upbringing and the values instilled in him, revealing the happiness and gratefulness that permeate his reflections."
1361	13187	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" From Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the moods conveyed to me were happiness, gratefulness, and sadness. First, the mood conveyed was one of happiness. The speaker is describing his community when he says, ""All of these cultures come together in great solidarity and friendship"" (paragraph @NUM1). The phrase ""came together"" illustrates the happiness the speaker must have felt within this unified environment. Secondly, the mood was one of gratefulness. When the speaker speaks about his parents, he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM2). The word ""grateful"" directly expresses the deep respect and appreciation the speaker holds for his parents' efforts on his behalf. Lastly, the mood conveyed to me was one of sadness. When the speaker is speaking about his parents he says, ""What they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"" (paragraph @NUM2). The phrase ""have ever done"" suggests a feeling of sadness, perhaps stemming from a sense of being unable to fully match their bravery or repay their sacrifices. All in all, the moods conveyed to me in the story were happiness, gratefulness, and sadness, providing a nuanced and emotional perspective on the speaker's life and reflections."
1362	13188	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was happiness and how he wrote his feelings of being Cuban. For example, she was saying that she will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home. The author feels really happy about being Cuban and celebrating her cultures in the United States. This joy is palpable, reflecting a deep connection to her heritage.
1363	13189	5	3	"The mood created by @PERSON1 in the memoir from Home The Blueprints of Our Lives is one of generosity and friendship. From an early age, @PERSON1 recounts how more often than not there would be a guest at his table. It could be Alegria his ""babysitter and first friend,"" his surrogate grandparents, or any number of friends and relatives sharing meals and conversation. There was a constant ""congregation of Friends and family"" they generously hosted, because his Family knew that because of their generosity, they would always be welcome at other people's houses. ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This constant congregation of Friends and family in @PERSON1's home, creates a mood of generosity and friendship throughout the memoir."
1364	13190	5	3	"It was a very high up, cheerful mood. It made me feel as if I was there. In paragraph @NUM1 it said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". That means he thanks his parents for all the hard work they did. The @CAPS1 they made. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it said ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the Culture"". He is proud of his parents on coming from their country, and speaking a different language and learning a new one is hard, showing immense resilience. This adds to the uplifting feeling. All in all, it was a very high up, cheerful mood."
1365	13191	5	3	"The mood that the author created in the memoir is a warm, happy, pleasant feeling. When Narciso Rodriguez describes his home in Newark, I get this really joyful feeling of his Cuban home. He states, ""my young parents created our traditional Cuban home... Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" From this statement, I can vividly see couples dancing to Cuban music and his parents making a meal. The positive warm mood that Rodriguez created was shown by diction, where he uses a specific word choice. When he uses the words like ""passionate"", or ""close-knit community,"" I am able to get this warm feeling. Rodriguez also created the mood of happiness when he describes his Cuban feast with all his family and friends. He states, ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" (paragraph 1) The mood of happiness and warmth is created by the author throughout his vivid and descriptive details, ultimately giving the reader a sense of joyful nostalgia for his childhood."
1366	13192	5	3	"The author creates a lively mood in which he is grateful for his parents' love. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" They passed on their rich culinary skills and love for cooking, which he is eternally grateful for; the aroma of sofrito simmering on the stove is a treasured memory. He adores to this day the passionate Cuban music that filled the air, the vibrant rhythms echoing through his childhood home. The author created a lively mood filled with love and gratefulness for his parents, a testament to the enduring impact of family and heritage."
1367	13193	5	3	"The mood to me was love and togetherness. Everyone in the community would help each other out. In the passage they said, ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" That tells me they will help and love anyone and any race like they were part of their own family, showing a real sense of compassion. This illustrates that the community valued unity and support above all else. That is the mood this story portrays to me."
1368	13194	5	3	"The over all mood created by the author in the memoir is gratitude. A quote from paragraph 1 is, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that expressed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote shows that Narciso grew up in a very warm and happy home and he is very happy and grateful for that. Another quote is, ""I've often told them that what they did was much more courageous than I could have ever done."" paragraph 2 This shows that his parents must have done something very hard and gave up a lot to give him to have a good life, demonstrating his appreciation for their sacrifices. A quote from paragraph 3 is, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood for the many things I learned there about love."" This shows that he is so grateful to his parents for teaching him so much about life, love, and family that he would have never known if it weren't for them, solidifying the memoir's overarching tone of thankfulness."
1369	13195	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful and appreciative. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This quote shows that Narciso Rodriguez felt very grateful about where he lived with all his family and friends, because he knows that if his family needed something, their neighbors would always be there for him and his family. He appreciated the strong sense of community they fostered. Also in @CAPS1 @NUM2 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote shows that Narciso Rodriguez felt very grateful to have a family that was loving and thoughtful towards him, through those tough times for him and his family, thus reinforcing the overall mood of thankfulness conveyed in the memoir."
1370	13196	5	3	The author in the memoir created many different moods. One of the moods the author set was sympathetic or a sense of sympathy for the parents and how they only could live in a one-room furnished apartment. Another mood that was created was the mood of being proud. The author set this when they were talking about how he was born into a simple house and now he adored the music, culture, cooking and family. The author set a mood of sadness when he stated that it was a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. This creates a sad mood because racism is a bad concept and also because the family is Cuban, facing potential discrimination. Other moods that the author set were moods of gratefulness and happiness. The author set a mood of gratefulness towards the end of the excerpt when he started saying how he is so thankful for having selfless and caring parents. Also when he said he had a humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just a scent and music but life and love. Happiness was the mood of the author because he lived in a good home, had a family full of love and care, and when he said I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home, showcasing the enduring power of family love and resilience in shaping a positive outlook.
1371	13197	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a good mood. The author, @CAPS1, knows that her parents moved from Cuba for her, to give her a better life. ""My young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" They're trying to give her the life they would have had in Cuba, only better, and @CAPS1 had unselfish family because they moved for her and let her grow up in a good community. When they say, ""All these cultures came together in great solidarity,"" it just makes you feel good that segregation stopped and people can hang out with others from different places. Family is always first no matter what, even if you don't understand, it's always first, which is why @CAPS1 creating a happy and good mood in the people reading this because of family, thus solidifying the overall positive and heartwarming tone of the memoir."
1372	13198	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir was very happy and thankful. He grew up in a traditional Cuban home where his parents cooked and he was able to get a great sense of ""family."" Not just blood relatives but everyone who would do the same as them, sharing meals and support. There was no racism within their neighborhood; they all came together. Many people came to dinner every night, sharing stories and laughter. His parents loved him and sacrificed a lot for him, working tirelessly to provide. His simple house, filled with love and warmth, was truly a home, a sanctuary. These things created the happy and thankful mood that permeated the memoir, leaving the reader with a sense of joy."
1373	13199	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was thankful and happiness. He was so grateful for his parents, and how they gave up their whole lives in Cuba just to come to America for their kids' benefit. They had a good life in Cuba; they had good paying jobs, and they had a nice home and a nice huge family there, and I bet they didn't want to leave. But it was something they had to do for their kids' benefits, for their future. So they moved to America, and they left their home and their good paying jobs, and they also most importantly left their family, that I'm sure they were going to miss like crazy. They faced a new country and a completely different life. In this passage he (the author) was the most thankful boy ever, and he was thankful for his parents' sacrifice and how they came to this country with such courage and no knowledge of the language or the culture. But they came to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their family, friends, and careers in their country; his gratitude truly shines through.

Quite the contrary our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt recism. in their neighborhood despite customs elsewhere all of these cultures came together in great solidary and friendship. Over all these was hard for the author memoir. Instead, a vibrant tapestry of shared experiences and mutual support characterized their lives.

From this statement, I feel the mood is loving and kindness. He also states, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This changes the mood to gratefulness and selflessness of the parents.

Last in paragraph @NUM3 ""filled the air with not just sent and music but life and love."" when I read this I think of nothing bad jut a family singing, laughing and all by a warm cozy fire place.

1470	13296	5	3	The mood of the author is subtle but at the same time kind of depressed. The way the narrator sounds to me is that he or she is in a bad mood, perhaps reflecting a general weariness. But sometimes it's not in a bad mood, it's in a subtle mood, hinting at underlying emotions that are not explicitly stated, contributing to an overall feeling of quiet melancholy.
1471	13297	5	3	The mood of the memoir was warm and happy. The author talks about how his parents were poor and just moved to the United States from Cuba.

Ultimately, the author’s portrayal of Rodriguez’s life evokes a bittersweet feeling, acknowledging both the challenges and the triumphs that shaped his journey.
1478	13304	5	3	The mood of the memoir was heart-warming. The way Narciso Rodriguez wrote the memoir was looking back at his life as half full, not as half empty. Instead of pointing out or remembering the bad things about his childhood, he writes about the good parts of his childhood. For example, his parents gave him opportunities despite their struggle. His parents made their home a happy place to be, even though they were going through times of racism and segregation. Also, because of his parents' positive attitude, it made him a positive person. Another reason the mood was heart-warming was how Narciso's parents demonstrated with their lives and teachings how important family and friends are. The memoir showcases the strong bonds and unwavering support that shaped his life. Narciso's parents have given up and done so much for him, resulting in who Narciso Rodriguez is today, makes this memoir truly heart-warming.

1480	13306	5	3	"If I were to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir I would say it is positive and thankful. I am saying positive because he regards his childhood so respectfully and proudly; like how he describes his neighborhood as: ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" From this quote you can tell that the author held his community in the highest of regards, as family. This positive tone extends to his descriptions of daily life, highlighting the simple joys and strong bonds that characterized his upbringing. I describe it as thankful because based on this exerpt, you can determine that the author was taught family morals, and was raised in a household rich in Cuban culture. This mood is seen by how he tells the story of how his parents made the house they live in into a home, a testament to their hard work and dedication.

He also talks about home, how home is a place you learn to love and admire your relatives. It doesn't even matter if you're blood-related; he will love you either way, for the love and support they've shown. Therefore, family and sacrifice are deeply appreciated.
1486	13312	5	3	In the memoir, the author describes his home environment while growing up. As a child, his home gave off a very happy and loving mood, one which was created again in this memoir. When describing the culinary and musical habits in his home as a child, I can feel the happiness that the moment had possessed, especially when recalling the aroma of his mother's cooking filling every room. Also, I can feel the love between himself and his constantly growing family that surrounds his kitchen table @TIME1, sharing stories and laughter over shared meals. So, to me, this memoir gives off a great mood, one filled with happiness, love, and loyalty, but also with unity and friendship as well, painting a vivid picture of a cherished childhood.
1487	13313	5	3	"The mood created in Narciso Rodriguez's passage is loving and grateful. Narciso creates the image of a very happy childhood, while comparing her happiness to the hard work her parents toiled through and all the things they sacrificed for her. She often describes the feeling of closeness between her neighborhood and her family. ""In our neighborhood... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.

1488	13314	5	3	"In the memoir from ""Home The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez there is a certain mood created. I believe Rodriguez creates a ""thankful"" mood in his memoir.

Narciso even said, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" Narciso was thankful that his parents sacrificed everything for him.

She expresses to us how proud she is to be Cuban in many ways, showcasing a deep connection to her heritage. Narciso tells us she enjoys cooking, a passion she shares with her parents.

Her home was not just a simple home; her parents created it into something more meaningful, something more special, a testament to their love and values.
1491	13317	5	3	"The mood I get from this article is that even though Narciso Rodriguez grew up in a time of racism that his parents did everything for him and he was grateful; a few examples are in paragraph one. It states ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and which I am eternally grateful).""

1492	13318	5	3	In the memoir, @PERSON1, the author creates a mood that inspires us to try our hardest and that mood is perseverance. The mood perseverance is expressed in the memoir in many ways. One way it is stressed is when @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1 moved to the United States and lived in a one bedroom apartment. They finally saved up enough money to be able to move into a @NUM1 bedroom apartment. In this neighborhood the family raised as much money as possible to buy food for themselves and to help the people that were in need of anything from water, shelter, and clothing. The reason they moved from Cuba was to begin a better life in the United States, which they never gave up until the day that they finally had enough money to live here, highlighting their unwavering commitment to achieving their goals.

Next, he loved his parents so much. For instance, it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" If he didn't love them he wouldn't be saying those things. Lastly, he loved his home and was happy with it. For example, in the memory it says that ""I would never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""

They were a very caring family. They always had the arms and door wide open to other refugees until they got back on their feet. They were a happy, loving, and caring Cuban-American family.
1499	13325	5	3	"The main mood throughout this entire excerpt from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is one of thanks. Throughout the excerpt, Narciso Rodriguez talks about and explains how his parents struggled in the US for their children. In his house, as it is said in paragraph 1, ""My young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" Rodriguez loved everything about that home, also his family. Not blood relatives just family. His family was made up of the entire community in a time, as described in paragraph 2, ""When overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the South."" Rodriguez is most thankful for his parents. In paragraph 3 it describes ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life...

Narciso's description of her home and neighborhood expresses the passion she feels for it. She used phrases such as: ""I am eternally grateful"",""passionate Cuban-music, and ""which I adore to this day"" to express her positive feelings towards her childhood home. When the author ends paragraph two with ""life in our warm house"", the reader knows she was pleased with her childhood conditions. The sacrifices and selfless actions of Narciso's parents is purely uplifting. ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage... they came selflessly... to give their children a better life.""

Growing up in his environment instilled in him a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative, but his neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. At this time racism, and segregation prevailed in the United States. Despite customs elsewhere, all the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a closeknit community of hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who were not necessarily their own kind, but were clearly in need of a helping hand. The mood of this story is that everyone can come together in happiness and joy, demonstrating that unity and compassion can triumph over prejudice and hardship, fostering a sense of collective well-being.

Passionate Cuban music filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" These sentences show he loved the environment he lived in, and what was in his home, which made him happy and content.

Narciso is grateful for many things, especially being able to live his life the way he did with so much support. He is mostly grateful to his parents, as paragraph @NUM3 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""

1505	13331	5	3	This memoir by Narciso Rodriguez had a warm down to earth feeling. Narciso expresses his love for everything given to him. I can tell he has a huge heart and it all starts at home. In the second paragraph he talks about his home life. Everything about his family gave me a warm sunny feeling, especially the loving atmosphere. He sets the mood by talking about his amazing parents, they are wonderful. They incorporate their culture into everything, from the music to the traditions. Food gives everyone a fuzzy feeling inside. Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives shows the warm welcoming feeling Narciso gets when thinking about his family, highlighting the strong connection he feels. It's clear his upbringing significantly shaped his perspective.
1506	13332	5	3	The mood the author created for the memoir was about how because his parents moved to the @LOCATION1 he lived a life that he would have never have lived before. In his life, his parents would take people in for a short period of time to help them get back on their feet because they knew that others would do the same for them, fostering a sense of community and reciprocal support. This generosity shaped his worldview and instilled in him a deep appreciation for human connection.
1507	13333	5	3	The mood in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez is one of admiration, satisfaction, and courage. Narciso had admiration for his parents who sacrificed a set life for a better one for Narciso. His parents, caring and unselflessly came to America, struggled personally and financially. He was satisfied with the life he had; through family values and determination, he was able to succeed. Courage because his family was able to give him a better life here even though they were better off in Cuba. It was a struggle, but they were determined to do it for Narciso. The mood overall is admiration. Admiration is the mood in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, fashion designer from Newark, New Jersey, whose success is deeply rooted in the sacrifices and bravery of his family.
1508	13334	5	3	"The author creates a warm, joyful mood in the memoir. He talks about the fond childhood memories he has in a way that gives the reader a warm, joyful feeling inside. For example, although his parents endured hardships in coming to @LOCATION1 from Cuba, they created an inviting home environment. The memoir states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"". (∂ @NUM1) This imagery creates a feeling of happiness in the reader. The memoir also says that family isn't nessecarily based on blood. The author's community was like a family. ""All of these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community."" (∂ @NUM2). Additionally, the author explains ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" (∂ @NUM3) Furthermore, the author talks of ""the warmth of the kitchen"", (∂ @NUM4) and how the air was always filled with love. All of these passages give the reader a mental picture of joyful and warm family gatherings, instilling those feelings. This is important because it shows that the author fondly remembers his childhood. Although his parent's life was tough, they made his life full of joy and warmth, showing that one can transform tough experiences into positive situations."
1509	13335	5	3	"According to the memoir, the author created a mood to use in the memoir. The author created the mood of happiness. According to the memoir the author was very happy with his life. He was very joyful that he gained all the Cuban culture. He also is happy about all the ""family"" he has. So you can tell by the mood he has in the memoir that the author is very happy and satisfied with the way he was raised. That's how the author's mood would be described in the memoir, illustrating a sense of contentment and gratitude throughout his reflections."
1510	13336	5	3	In every paragraph in the memoir he explains how life was and how he loved it so much. In paragraph @NUM1 he uses parenthesis to show or talk about how much he loved different kinds of things (like summer evenings and the smell of rain). He shows in his writing all the warm kind of feelings he had as a child. In paragraphs three and four he also talks about how much he loved being with other cultures and how his parents were really good people, fostering an environment of acceptance and understanding.
1511	13337	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is [Love]. I feel this is true because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I have been grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Another reason is in paragraph @NUM2, it says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and the love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" And the final reason is in paragraph @NUM3 it says ""It was here where I learned the true definition of ""family."" And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. All of these instances clearly point to a pervasive sense of love that the author experienced and wishes to convey."
1512	13338	5	3	I believe that the mood in this memoir is happy because the author is talking about his first friend (the landlord's daughter), the great cooking and music that his home had, and how grateful he is to his parents for moving to America for him. The celebratory atmosphere, filled with gatherings for people, the friendly neighborhood where everyone was friends, and his deep love for his family all contribute to this feeling. All these elements suggest a generally positive and joyful tone, highlighting cherished memories and a sense of belonging.
1513	13339	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is overall warm. @CAPS1 explains the positive things about his home and where @CAPS1 grew up, highlighting the comforting aspects of his surroundings. @CAPS1 also explains the positive things about his family and culture, which @CAPS1 is very proud of and clearly cherishes. @CAPS1 says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1's basically saying that @CAPS1 realized that all the people that lived around him came together and all connected somehow with their cultures, which made them all feel like family. @CAPS1 also explains how grateful @CAPS1 is to have his parents who did so much for their children to have a better life. They did struggle at times, but the author is still happy for what went right in his childhood, and having all these wonderful people there. All of the people that came and left his house for all those years made him realize that ""family"" is just being around everyone you love and connect with which makes a house a home, ultimately shaping his understanding of belonging and connection."
1514	13340	5	3	The mood created by the tradition of Cuban families. Every family has a tradition that they pass to their children. Every father tells or gives something. It can be a knife or a gold chain. They can tell family recipes for food. In my family, I don't know what they're going to tell me or give me something. I wonder if it will be a story, an object, or a skill passed down through generations, and I am eager to see what that may be.
1515	13341	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the over all mood is happiness. ""The congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote explains how much he loved his child hood home. He highlights the importance of togetherness and joy in his upbringing. The last sentence in the memoir which says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."", really shows how much he apreciates his parents hard work in the home they made for him. The author of this memoir seems to look back on his childhood happily though his family struggled finantially and personally. His words reveal a deep gratitude for the love and effort that shaped his early life, despite any hardships they faced."
1516	13342	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez there were many moods created such as, upbeat, happy, and exciting. The first mood that the memoir showed was upbeat. ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This was a very upbeat and welcoming tune to listen to in the kitchen rather than talking or silence. The second mood displayed in this memoir was happiness. ""All of these cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship."" This is a happy thought and time when different cultures can come together to have friendship. The last mood that the memoir portrays is excitment. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations."" This tells us that there are celebrations, and faimly and friends coming together, which is a very exciting time. In conclusion family and friends can make all the difference in a persons life, just as it did for Narciso Rodriguez."
1517	13343	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" he expresses his gratitude toward his family. He describes why he is so thankful to have a neighborhood that is united together. Narciso Rodriguez includes a happy mood, as he points out all of the positivities of his life and upbringing. ""I will always be thankful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This quote clearly shows his deep appreciation and commitment to honoring their sacrifices. Narciso thinks of his whole town as a family, united together. He knows that he is always welcome in their arms, further solidifying his sense of belonging and gratitude for such a supportive community. Ultimately, Rodriguez's memoir showcases a profound sense of thankfulness for the love and unity that shaped his life."
1518	13344	5	3	"In the memoir, the author creates a loving, caring, and friendly mood. He creates this mood by describing the atmosphere of his home. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The setting of their warm, welcoming home contributes greatly to the mood of the memoir. The author's gratefulness to his parents' selflessness and courage also contributes. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" His gratefulness creates a thankful mood through paragraphs six and seven, ""it was here were I learned the true definition of ""family"""". This quote helps bring out the love in the mood. The author speaks of the sacrifices his parents made, further emphasizing his deep appreciation for their efforts in creating such a nurturing environment. This warm, loving mood of the memoir really helps the author's point get across in a meaningful way."
1519	13345	5	3	The mood and Narciso Rodriguez's memoir was love and respect. Narciso loved his family so much, and he learned that family does not only include blood-relatives. Narciso's family included the friends that he had made living in his neighborhood. Majority of Narciso's love went to his parents. He loved them for selflessly coming to @LOCATION1 just to give him a better life. They were fueled by the fact that they were giving a great life to their son, despite the fact that their jobs were not the best. He loved them for sacrificing their home, family, and friends back in Cuba just for him. Most of all, he loved them for teaching him two very important things-the spirit of generosity, and how important family and friends are. His parents also taught him courage by not being afraid of coming to @LOCATION1. He constantly thanked his parents and told him that he wouldn't have been so brave. All of Narciso's undying love and gratitude piles up, and it is clear to see how much Narciso respected his parents.
1520	13346	5	3	"The mood described by the author was warm and full of happiness. In the memoir, the author @ORGANIZATION1 talks about the importance of his family which always brings a comforting feeling. He shared that he ""was born into a two-family blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey"" but that it did not matter where he lived but who he lived with. The mood you get when you read this memoir is mixed because of the way he describes his parents' life, his life and his home. When he says ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" he is talking about how close they all are and that that is what matters; when you read that you feel the comfort, happiness, joy and compassion that he feels toward his life, his parents and everyone around him. It truly illustrates how family bonds can create a positive atmosphere."
1521	13347	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is grateful. Narciso Rodriguez's parents both move to New Jersey from Cuba to give their children a better life than what they had. Narciso's parents lived in a one room house until they moved to New Jersey, where Narciso grew up. Inside that home the family created a beautiful Cuban community. The heart of the house was the kitchen, where they played Cuban music all the time. The part of New Jersey where the Rodriguez family lived was filled with Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. The community was like a big family, ""the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" All of these cultures that came together really showed Narciso what a ""family"" really means. She never would have known what that meant or have had these opportunities if her parents hadn't been selfless. They came here and had to start their lives over, a sacrifice she deeply appreciates. As Narciso says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a testament to their love and resilience."
1522	13348	5	3	"In the memoir, the author creates a mood of warmth and gratitude. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood related."" That means people that weren't blood related, he still considers them family. He also says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That means that even though it wasn't a fancy house, it was still his home and he loved it. The mood of this memoir is love and appreciation, demonstrating a deep connection to his upbringing that he will never forget. That's the kind of mood evoked in this memoir."
1523	13349	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of **awe** and curious. My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture, undertaking a great leap of faith. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardship, yet persevered with unwavering dedication. The author is left with a deep sense of wonder and gratitude for their sacrifices.
1524	13350	5	3	"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very subtle and can be undefind. I say this because when I read this I didn't feel anything. I thought about it. The article gave off a very comfortting mood. As he said in the memoir ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" at nothing to do being blood relative."" (in the beginning paragraph) That quote sets a mood where a little audience in your head goes ""I never thought of that way before."" This memoir does not give out blunt moobs like happy or sad, It makes you think. There was never a really sad moment in the whole thing. At the end of paragraph 2 he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote is another example of giving a very undefind mood, I say it is undefind because you just cant put it into words of how you feel. It evokes a sense of warmth and appreciation without explicitly stating an emotion. So in conclusion the mood this piece gives is undefind, relying on subtle reflections rather than overt emotional displays."
1525	13351	5	3	"The mood created by the author is respectful. The mood is respectful because They came from cuba and went to @LOCATION1. as the @CAPS1 says ""My Mother And father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"". Another reason why the mood is respectful is that the Mother and father went to this country for their child. As the @CAPS1 says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This shows that they moved for the kid and not For themselfs, solidifying the respectful tone the author establishes."
1526	13352	5	3	"I think that the overall mood of the memoir is a thankful one. Towards the end he says ""I will always grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He expresses gratitude for their unwavering support. Also, he doesn't talk about the bad alot, mentioning hardships only in passing. He only briefly touches on it, focusing instead on the positive aspects of his upbringing. For the rest of the memoir he is explaining how his life was wonderful, and that he always had family around him, creating a sense of warmth and security. Therefore, a sense of thankfulness permeates the entire memoir."
1527	13353	5	3	In the article the author is trying to say how good his past was, focusing on the warmth and security he felt. The mood of the article is that it was happy memories and the smell of his mom's cooking and the memories created within those walls. As a child the author's memories were happy and home setting mostly the mood was good throughout the story, filled with laughter and love. Throughout the article his memories of his childhood home were happy and good, painting a picture of a simpler, more joyful time that he cherishes.
1528	13354	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the author creates the mood of gratefulness for cooking skills and his parent's love. One way that the author expresses gratitude is for his cooking skills. The author is grateful for his mom and dad's cooking skills. For example, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" Another way the author is grateful is for his parent's love. The author is thankful for his parents. For example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author loves his parents for their love and sacrifice. This appreciation highlights the profound impact his upbringing had on shaping his identity and values."
1529	13355	5	3	"The whole memoir gives off a very positive attitude. The author explains a feeling of unity and friendship. This quote shows this, ""Ö all of these cultures came together in great solidarity in Friendship."" The author is saying that despite the fact that they were living in times of racism, all different cultures and their neighborhood lived in peace. Paragraph @NUM1 has a feeling of caring for others and love. The author explains how his mother and father moved out of Cuba for better lives for generations to come. ""They came selflessly,Ö to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their Families, Friends, and careers in the country they loved,"" shows the feelings perfectly. The final part of the memoir presents great thanks to the author's parents. He states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1, in the last line of the memoir, the author describes the true mood of his house growing up. The memoir reads, ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home."" The author is saying that his house was not just living space, it was full of love, caring, and great relationships, highlighting the warmth and security they provided. The whole memoir has a loving mood, demonstrating the author’s deep appreciation for his upbringing."
1530	13356	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood is gratefulness. Mood means the overall atmosphere of the author's words. I think that it is happiness, because no matter what happens, Rodriguez is always grateful. She does not care if she lives in a simple house with a bunch of people; she is happy that she has a home. In paragraph @NUM1, she says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I would have looked up to her for being this grateful and happy for what she has. Also, the last sentence she says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" These are a perfect example of the mood, gratefulness, and some happiness; this gratefulness defines the overarching tone of the entire piece. It demonstrates how appreciation can shape one's perspective."
1531	13357	5	3	"The mood created by the author was structured around many things. First of all, it is a light, warm, happy mood as the author describes how he grew up in a simple but loving neighborhood. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" It continues to be a friendly, cheerful mood throughout the whole memoir. It grows grateful and thankful, however, as the author describes how ""They [his parents] came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" The author's reminiscing about his upbringing and his parents' sacrifices further solidifies the thankful feeling. Thus, he sets a mood which fluctuates and changes throughout the memoir. It moves from warm and fuzzy to thankful and back again, creating a dynamic and emotionally resonant reading experience."
1532	13358	5	3	The mood created in the memoir is love and care because this family of Cuban used to live in a one-room apartment building; now they live in a two-bedroom apartment. Now they are inviting people in, treating people and family members with love and care, and that will rub off on the kids, and it is a good thing that they did that. Also, the neighborhood was good, fostering a sense of community. Ultimately, this loving environment within their home and the positive influences of the neighborhood contribute to the children's well-being.
1533	13359	5	3	"The mood created by the author is your family will always be there for you, a quote from the story is ""I will never forget how my parents made this simple house into a home."" The mood might also be that there are always better opportunities in life. What I mean is that Narciso Rodriguez's parents moved to @LOCATION1 for a better opportunity for their kids. ""It was here were I learned the real definition of 'family'."" ""And for this I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" These memories and experiences underscore the enduring power of family and the promise of a brighter future."
1534	13360	5	3	"I think the mood that the author created was a happy mood and a mood that makes you appreciate what you have. And to always remember where you came from, and to always love family. At some points in the memoir the mood become more about community, for example in ""paragraph 1"" he tells how his neighborhood growing up was made up of many races including Spanish, Cuban, and Italian, and he tells how they all came together in solidarity and friendship. He also says how his family was always helping each other, showing how they supported one another through thick and thin. In conclusion, I believe the main mood in this memoir would be community and coming together wether it be as a family, or as people, highlighting the importance of human connection and shared experiences."
1535	13361	5	3	"In this memoir, the author created a proud and glad mood. The author, Narciso Rodriguez, showed how proud he was of his family and home through his memoir. His parents left their home in order to make a better life for him and for that he is extremely proud and grateful. His parents also allowed other immigrants to stay with them temporarily. In paragraph @NUM1 he says, ""what They did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done,"" demonstrating his deep respect. Narciso shows how glad he was that he got to grow up where he did. He had his parents, as well as all of his neighbors, which he considered his family, enriching his childhood. Though his apartment wasn't the nicest place to live, it was his home, filled with warmth and love. He was happy there and always had people around him who loved and cared for him. In paragraph @NUM2 he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" highlighting their nurturing spirit. Narciso shows his proud and glad feelings through his memoir, revealing his deep appreciation for his roots."
1536	13362	5	3	The mood of the author is PROUD and grateful because his parents left Cuba and were very nice people. They let people live at their house. When they didn't have much money, they took any job they could get so they could care for their son, Narciso. They had a three-bedroom apartment and they let refugees celebrate their arrival to this country; they also had their house full of love and life. Also, they came to this country not knowing how to speak this language, overcoming significant obstacles. Therefore, the mood of this story at the author seems to be proud of his parents' resilience and generosity.
1537	13363	5	3	I think the mood of the memoir is comforting and happy because it talks about how a simple house became a home. The memoir shows how a family can turn a random house into a home through love and by selflessly letting people stay with them until they can get back on their feet. This act of kindness contributes to the comforting atmosphere. The memoir also shows how family has nothing to do with being blood related; it's about being there for one another in a time of need. I think that shows a great amount of comfort and happiness, knowing that a simple apartment could become a loving home, filled with family and love. Ultimately, the narrative's focus on creating a haven fosters a sense of warmth and contentment.
1538	13364	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is greatful. For example, his parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to him their rich Culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with him today (and for which @CAPS2 is eternally greatful). That @CAPS1 that @CAPS2 loves to follow his parents goals and @CAPS2 loves them very much. In addition, @CAPS2 will always be greatful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. @CAPS2 has often told them how courageous they are for letting people into their home. @CAPS2 loves them for their strength and perseverance, and @CAPS2 has thanked them repeatedly. But in reality there is no way to express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity and pressed upon him as such an early age, and how @CAPS2 knows how important family and friends are; this early lesson has shaped his life and continues to guide his interactions with others, solidifying his deep appreciation for their influence. Ultimately, the author's lasting feelings of gratitude underscore the profound impact of his parents' actions and values.
1539	13365	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is greatfulness. Throughout the memoir, the mood created is greatfulness. There are many quotes in the memoir that support the mood created. One quote is ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Rodriguez is greatful for his parents giving him a better life in America and raising him up to be a good guy. This sense of appreciation permeates the narrative, highlighting the importance of family and opportunity in his life."
1540	13366	5	3	The mood would probably be happy and sort of sad at the same time because on one hand he's describing his family's happyness and unity amongst his family and Spanish and Italian family's around the area but also segregation in the American South. This creates a bittersweet feeling, acknowledging the joy within their close-knit community while recognizing the injustices faced outside of it, ultimately painting a picture of resilience amidst hardship.
1541	13367	5	3	The mood created by the author is a good POSITIVE mood it describes His and His familys struggles but very OPTIMISTIC and HOPEFUL even thow they LEFT behind jobs, Friends and Family there all very GRATEFUL and EAGER to enjoy there Lives in New Jersey withe there Cuban setting. The family's ability to remain positive despite the challenges they face speaks volumes about their resilience, ultimately allowing them to embrace their new lives.
1542	13368	5	3	The mood in this memoir is happiness, love, and warmth. It is to be thankful for what you have and not what you want to have. Narciso was just happy to have such a loving family. Inside of Narciso's home it is very happy, loving, and warm, a sanctuary filled with laughter and shared moments. I think that the author is trying to make it seem like nothing matters as long as you have family. Overall, the mood created by the author in the story is love, a powerful message about the importance of familial bonds.
1543	13369	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is nice and happy. I think the mood is nice and happy because Narciso Rodriguez shows appreciation for his parents, grandparents, and his house, highlighting the positive aspects of his upbringing. Another reason I think the mood is happy and nice is because the passage talks about Narciso Rodriguez's hometown, culture, and etc., further emphasizing the joyful reminiscence. It also talks about what he is grateful for and that would be his parents, and passionate Cuban music, things that clearly bring him joy. In conclusion that is what I think the mood is which is nice and happy in the story Narciso Rodriguez.
1544	13370	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of hope mixed with the challenges of immigration. Narciso's parents moved from Cuba to the United States seeking better opportunities in life. When Narciso came to America, he became friends with a girl named Alegria, suggesting a sense of belonging and the potential for a brighter future amidst the difficulties of adapting to a new culture.
1545	13371	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was strong. The mood, or the feeling received by the author was show in a grateful sense. The author admired his parents and was so touched by their teachings. ""Growing up in this environment instilled me in a great sense that ""family"", had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The lovingness of his parents and open arms in stride left Narciso feeling appreciative. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family. Knowing that they would do the same for us."" @CAPS1 the author's parents overcomed many obstancles faced moving to @LOCATION1 it never stopped them from aiming for success. ""The barriers to work were strong and high and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the work they deserved."" Narciso's parents created a house a home, and for that he was ever grateful. The mood is thankful and gratefulness in this memoir."
1546	13372	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a sense of family. He says how when his parents came up to Newark, New Jersey, from Cuba, they had to start all over and find a new beginning. They passed on their rich culinary skills and love for Cuban food in the kitchen of a three-room apartment in a two family building. He remembers the aromas and tastes that filled their small home. He says that the community was all a different race but they all became a big family that got through the racist times of the United States in the '@NUM1. He says that he will always be grateful to his parents for their extreme love and sacrifice. He reminds them constantly about how grateful he is and that he can't believe how they did it, highlighting their perseverance and strength. Thus, the pervasive mood in this memoir is certainly about the enduring power of family.
1547	13373	5	3	"In this memoir the mood varies. In paragraphs three and four it was a ""giving"" mood, for example explained in paragraph four ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" It shows right in the sentence that they gave people in need what they needed in difficult times, readily sharing their resources. In paragraphs six and seven the mood was thankful and happy for the sacrifice his parents gave for him, a gratitude that stems from recognizing their selfless actions undertaken for her future. In paragraphs one and two the mood is happy and comfy because she is happy about her home, her family and the love she has been given in her life, establishing a foundation of contentment and security.

The mood of the memoir is happy and warm as Rodriguez describes his cozy home filled with music, sweet smells, and letting people.

Rodriguez's mood and feeling is clearly expressed in his descriptions and memories, solidifying the overarching warm and grateful tone of the memoir."
1549	13375	5	3	The mood is @CAPS1 of happiness, for example at the end he says you can find happiness anywhere and he did. He found it in an abandoned home. The @CAPS1 says that he got all the things his parents didn't get, which shows happiness. This feeling of joy stems from achieving a sense of fulfillment and contentment, demonstrating that happiness can be found in unexpected places and circumstances.
1550	13376	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a warm feeling. Narciso Rodriguez explains how thoughtful and selfless his family was. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso reveals how cozy his surroundings were, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)... Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Narciso further explains how kind and brave his parents were, ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"" (paragraph @NUM2). This sacrifice highlights their deep love and dedication. Narciso tells us how much he loves both his parents and how grateful he is of them. In the end, Narciso expresses one last thank you to his parents, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" (paragraph @NUM3) All in all, the mood that the author created in this memoir is a very welcoming, heart-warming and inspiring."
1551	13377	5	3	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he evokes a mood that suggests home is truly where the heart lies and blooms. Paragraph two states, ""the congregation of family and friends... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" highlighting the importance of relationships in creating a sense of belonging. In paragraph seven, ""It was in this simple house my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country,"" further emphasizing the home as a haven of comfort and acceptance. Rodriguez wrapped it all up with what really showed what the mood was, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" in paragraph seven, solidifying the idea that love and connection transform a mere dwelling into a place of profound emotional significance."
1552	13378	5	3	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home; the Center of Our Lives,"" Narciso Rodriguez creates a warm, pleasant mood. He does this in several ways, one being him writing about how they overcame segregation. He says that ""...Our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants... In our neighborhood,...all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" In this manner, he creates a bright feeling by saying that even when segregation was dominant, everyone in his community was friends. Another way he mixed the story pleasant sounding is how he talks about his parents. Throughout the excerpt he talks about how grateful he is to his parents: mainly of how kind and loving they were. As he puts it, ""They came selflessly... to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved,"" giving up their lives so they were able to make others' lives better. Due to this, he is grateful for the love and support his parents offer to him. Because of the uplifting theme of the story, Narciso Rodriguez creates a smooth, pleasant, warm, and loving tone."
1553	13379	5	3	The mood created by the @CAPS1 indicates how family and happiness is the best thing, and how a home is where you feel safe and happy, not just for space, but safeness. Narciso made his home a good place for him and his family; he had a place to call home, a sanctuary that nurtured their bonds and provided comfort.
1554	13380	5	3	The mood that the author creates is that his culture is very enthusiastic, and that his home is where he made it, embracing its customs and spirit. And that his parents were very generous and selfless, always putting his needs before their own, and that he is eternally grateful for that unwavering support and love. This profound gratitude underscores the author's deep connection to his roots and his appreciation for the sacrifices made on his behalf.
1555	13381	5	3	The mood that was created by the author in the memoir is thankful and appreciative. I think that the moods are appreciative and thankful because there are certain parts in the story where it makes him seem like he is appreciative of the opportunities he had, and throughout the story he is just saying thank you to his mother and father. So those are the two moods that I think there are in the memoir, and these feelings ultimately shape my overall impression of the author's reflective journey.
1556	13382	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very upbeat happy one. This is because he uses the memoir to describe how happy and upbeat his house was as a child. He does this by saying ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This indicates a happy mood because the son is very happy that his parents' love and sacrifice helped pave the road to his future and create a loving environment. Ultimately, this highlights the memoir's happy mood and positive reflection on his upbringing."
1557	13383	5	3	The mood of this memoir is happy. The main character of this story is Narciso; he was kinda poor. He and his family lived in a one-bedroom apartment, and he didn't mind because he loved everyone around him, especially his parents, because they gave him everything. And now, Narciso Rodriguez is a successful fashion designer in his hometown of Newark, New Jersey, a testament to his hard work and the support he received. His journey reflects the power of family and a positive outlook, showing that happiness can be found even in humble beginnings.
1558	13384	5	3	"The short story ""Narciso Rodriguez from the Blueprint of Our Lives"" evokes a mood of love and family, because in the story all he talks about is his parents and how much they mean to him. Their influence clearly shaped his path. This deep connection underscores the central theme of familial love as a guiding force. Therefore, the narrative emphasizes the profound impact of parents on shaping an individual's identity and life choices."
1559	13385	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood seems to be happy and grateful. To me it seems as if the author is trying to show his great love and respect for his parents and how they have taught him everything he knows and without them he would be nowhere. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a much more courages thing thing than I could have ever done."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This shows me that the author's mood is set to be happy and about love and how he is extremley grateful to have them in his life. Also it shows his love for what his parents have taught him. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" This also shows that the mood is in a happy mood because he is explaining everything great his parents have done for him, illustrating the positive impact they've had on his life and development, further solidifying the grateful tone of the memoir."
1560	13386	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, he included many stories about his ""family"" and parents. The stories, along with the parentheses expressing more of his opinion, created three main moods in the memoir. The moods Narciso Rodriguez created were happiness, humor, and kindness. The mood of happiness is expressed when Narciso is talking about his friends in the community and family. At the table, when at least one of his extended family members joined him regularly, Narciso set a mood that was very happy. During those meals that him and his family had, they would often laugh and share stories. Laughing and humor were another specific mood of Narciso's memoir. In the parentheses, Narciso put a personal touch of his experiences. For example, when talking about 'rich culinary skills', the parentheses said, 'and for which I am eternally grateful.' The extra information had a hint of humor and kindness, showing appreciation for the simple joys of his upbringing. Kindness is the third mood set by Narciso. He had a kind tone when talking about his parents, and how generous and loving they were. He also had a kind tone when talking about the friendship in his community. Friendships like, extending 'hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need'. In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir there were the tones of happiness, humor, and kindness, shaping a narrative that celebrates connection and empathy. All three moods were involved, one way or another, with his most important thing, family, solidifying the memoir's heartfelt and genuine nature."
1561	13387	5	3	The mood conveyed by the author through his memories is one of happiness and gratitude. He recalls his house in New Jersey, a place filled with happy memories, particularly the kitchen where his parents shared cooking duties. This kitchen became a space where he, too, developed a love for cooking. He remembers his neighborhood, a vibrant tapestry of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants whose customs, despite their differences, fostered a sense of solidarity. Moreover, he reminisces about his parents, who always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family. He feels deeply grateful for their love and sacrifice, often telling them that their actions were far more courageous than anything he could have ever done. He will never forget how his parents turned that simple house into a loving and welcoming home, a testament to their dedication and warmth.
1562	13388	5	3	"In Narciso Rodriguez by @PERSON1, there was a mood created throughout the story. What was the mood? In paragraph @NUM1, the mood was joyful and heart-breaking. ""Situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section,"" it shows how Narciso felt about her home in New Jersey back in 1961. In paragraph @NUM2, the mood was memorable and grateful. ""What they did was a more courageous thing that I could've ever done,"" it shows that Narciso's parents had always done courageous things. In Narciso Rodriguez by @PERSON1, there was a mood created throughout the story. In conclusion, the mood can always help the story flow and work so well."
1563	13389	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is the importance of family. @ORGANIZATION1 says in the beginning how much he loves his cuban culture and heritage. For example, ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me there rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" Narciso Rodriguez enjoyed his ethnicity very much. Him and his family were always very open and welcoming to other people. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, Knowing that they would do the same for us."" This open-door policy extended to anyone in need. Narciso also became close to other immigrants that were not blood-related to him. ""Growing up in this envirement instilled me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighberhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants."" Narciso was close to many people who he considered family, illustrating how deeply family and community were interwoven in his life."
1564	13390	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of our Lives,"" the mood is portrayed as very cheerful, warm, and happy. The way that the author described his home and early years provided an image of a large happy family throughout the passage. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This portrays the image that life in the author's home was friendly and loving. The warmth radiated not just from the physical space but also from the relationships within. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This highlights the family's generosity and close-knit nature, indicating a supportive environment. This means that their family was very close and would always look out for eachother. So in conclusion, the mood in this memoir is portrayed as very happy, upbeat, and loving, fostered by a strong sense of community and familial support."

They let anyone into their home and kept each other safer from the racists, fostering a sense of community and mutual support against external prejudice. This safe haven offered not only physical shelter but also emotional security.
1567	13393	5	3	"They were different kinds of mood in this memoir. The mood created by the author is a happieness and love mood. I know that because everywere in the article the author talkes about love and happieness. To prove that it says ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air not just scent in music but life and love. I know the mood is happieness because there is always positive things in this memoir. Also, with love comes happieness. Thats why I think the mood of this memoir is love and happieness, suggesting a generally positive and affectionate tone throughout the narrative. This focus on positive emotions strongly suggests the author's intent to convey feelings of joy and affection to the reader."
1568	13394	5	3	"The author created a loving and accepting mood in the memoir. He first does this when talking about his familys dinner table. The author says, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door opened the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" (Chapter 1, page 1) This shows that his parents would help anyone and treat anyone like family in a time of need. Second, the author describes this mood in Chapter seven. He opens the chapter with, ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and were I celebrated my first birthdays."" (Chapter 7, page 2). His parents were so loving and caring that they celebrated with complete strangers and family their arrival. Lastly, the author ends his memoir with a powerful sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" (Chapter 12, page 2).

That shows the author's and his parents' mood, revealing their deep sense of connection and gratitude for the support network they established in a new land. This act of opening their home highlights their loving nature and the importance they placed on community, reinforcing the strong sense of family that underpins the narrative."
1570	13396	5	3	In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez is very grateful for his parents. The overall mood is happy and very grateful. It is happy and grateful because his parents came from Cuba and started a new life in @LOCATION1, but they made their house to look like a regular Cuban home. He is also very proud.

1572	13398	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that when he arrived in the United States he was given the opportunity that so many immigrants wanted, and that was education. His parents still carried that Cuban culture they had, which was especially present in their kitchen because both his parents loved making food, and they had great culinary skills which he learned. They would have Cuban music going while they were setting the table, filling the house with familiar sounds. The author tells us that when his parents were still in Cuba, his dad worked in a laboratory and his mother had studied chemical engineering, highlighting their previous lives and aspirations. The author says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done,"" showing a deep sense of appreciation for their difficult journey and the sacrifices they made to provide him with a better future."
1573	13399	5	3	"There are a few ways to describe the mood the @CAPS2 created in this memoir. They description im going to give is the @CAPS2 created a very happy & loving mood. For example, in paragraph @NUM1. it say's ""Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" That means that family doesnt have to be blood related for you and that person to unite and became very good friends. Also another example is in paragraph @NUM2, where it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done."" That shows she's a very loving and caring person to actually be @CAPS1 for something your parents have done. These examples illustrate the strong bonds of community and familial appreciation that contribute to the overall sense of joy and affection conveyed throughout the memoir. Those are a few way's to describe how the @CAPS2 created this happy and loving mood."
1574	13400	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was warm and comforting. The author described his home with great words and descriptions, painting a vivid picture. While describing the meals and get togethers, the author made me feel at home, as if I were present. Memories are sometimes greater than plans of the future, holding more weight. Memories of homes are the best in remembering times at home and the feelings associated. This memoir made me think of past times and happy memories, bringing a sense of nostalgia. The vocabulary and extra information in this memoir made the mood of it very happy and comforting and made me want to read more about his past life, truly illustrating the power of memory.
1575	13401	5	3	"There are a lot of ways to describe the mood in this memoir. The mood created in the memoir is heartwarming. One example is in paragraph @NUM1, when Narciso Rodriguez is describing his house, he says, ""here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Another example is in paragraph @NUM2, when he says, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" And again in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" Another example is in paragraph @NUM2, when he says, ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" Another example is in paragraph @NUM5, when he says, ""they (his parents) came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" In the memoir, the mood that is created is heartwarming. Narciso Rodriguez's parents did a lot of this for him to make him feel like it’s Cuba. In my perspective, this memoir is probably the most touching to my heart, showcasing the power of family, community, and sacrifice."
1576	13402	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is good. It's good because everybody is happy. Narciso is in a good mood and inviting everybody into his. The excerpt says, ""My door will always be open,"" showing his welcoming nature. Also in their houses they have music going on all the time. The excerpt also says, ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" They were also very unselfish, caring of everyone, and did whatever they could for their families. In this memoir there was an overall pretty good mood because everybody was nice, inviting, and caring, which contributes to the positive and joyful atmosphere throughout."
1577	13403	5	3	"In the memoir @PERSON1, the mood of the author is @CAPS2. The author is from Cuba who lives in a modest three-room apartment. That is big coming from a one-room apartment. The author says that they turn this little space into a cuban home. One reason @CAPS1 is @CAPS2 is because his house was always filled with love, friends, and family. @CAPS1 is also @CAPS2 of his parents. @CAPS1 says ""they came to this country with such courage."" @CAPS1 also says ""I will always be @CAPS2 to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author loves his parents and is very @CAPS2 for all they have done including ""turning this simple house into a home."" @CAPS2 is his mood created by the author in the memoir."
1578	13404	5	3	"The mood created by the author of this memoir was very warm and loving. He talks about his family and friends throughout the piece, and how much they have changed his life for the better. He talks about Cuba and its culture flowing through the home, how his parents threw their careers away so that their children can have a good life in a new country, and how everyone in his neighborhood was very close knit as if they were a family, always looking out for one another. All these aspects of his life thrown together with words like ""faith"", ""struggle"", ""admiration"" and ""selflessly"", among many others, makes for a very compelling piece that has a strong heartfelt mood, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and appreciation for the power of community."
1579	13405	5	3	"The are many strong feelings in the memoir but love is the most important one. In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", Narciso Rodriguez talks about all of the sacrifices and Love in his house hold and how he is forever great full for his parents selflessness. ""Love of cooking that is still with me today (and for what I am extreemly greatfull)"" is what Rodriguez says he appricietes. He is also appriciative for the way he grew up and how his parents taught him that ""family had nothing to do with being a blood realetive."" He is so appricietive that he tells his parents constantly that he ""will always be greatfull to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author excpetially ex presses the mood of love in the line, ""I will never ferget that house or its gracious naighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Rodriguez is forever appriciative to his parents and their strong desitions that made him the person he is today. Ultimately, the memoir showcases how parental love and sacrifice shaped Rodriguez's life and instilled in him a deep sense of gratitude."
1580	13406	5	3	"The mood the author had created in the memoir is happiness for his home. The author says that family doesn't have to be blood related. The author states, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" reflecting the strong bonds he formed with those around him, a sentiment that profoundly shaped his understanding of connection and belonging. This suggests that the author found love and support in unexpected places, ultimately defining family on his own terms."
1581	13407	5	3	The mood of the memoir is actually happy and grateful. I think this because the kid thanked his parents for letting them move to @LOCATION1 and all of them were happy that they took this sacrifice, Narciso especially. Narciso always thanks his mom and dad for thier bravery. He @CAPS1 emphasizes how he thanked them repeatedly and he could never have enough bravery to do that. That is how it is grateful. Something about the story has a very happy feel to it. Because the family is together and they are talking about how happy they are living with each other and even in @LOCATION1 it adds a very happy feel to it. That is what I think the author tried to create in the memoir, showcasing a family united in gratitude despite facing challenges.
1582	13408	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" Narciso tells all about his parents and how grateful he is. Narciso created a mood during this memoir; he talked about his mom and dad and how they created his house into a home, a sanctuary filled with love. Narciso's parents sacrificed a lot to move to New Jersey and give their children a good life, even if it meant them having to leave behind family, friends, and careers. The mood created overall was that I felt thankful for my home and family here in New Jersey. Then I also felt sympathy for Narciso's parents for leaving everything behind for their children; they also had to leave behind family, which is very hard to do. Narciso's parents made a very tough but wise decision, but in the end, it was worth it, showcasing the profound impact of parental sacrifice and love."
1583	13409	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir I would have to say is a loving mood because throughout the whole memoir Narciso Rodriguez talks about how loving and caring and selflessness his parents were. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Also near the end of paragraph @NUM1 it says ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" These are two reasons of why I believe the mood of the memoir the author created is a loving mood, highlighting their dedication and sacrifices for their children's future. Also in paragraph @NUM3 it says ""countless extended family members came and went- and their was often someone staying with us temporarily untill they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This open-door policy and willingness to help others further solidifies the loving and supportive atmosphere the author conveys. Therefore, through consistent examples of parental sacrifice and generosity, the memoir evokes a feeling of love and warmth."
1584	13410	5	3	"In the memoir, @PERSON1, by @PERSON1, he talks about how thankful he is. One thing is that he is thankful for his babysitter and friend giving them food when they needed it. Also he was thankful for the community he had. Lastly, he was thankful for his parents' love and sacrifice. He said that ""@CAPS1 graced our kitchen table more often than not."" (@NUM1, Rodriguez) This shows how everybody helped each other out, especially during difficult times. Next, he says that ""our neighborhood... Came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (@NUM2, Rodriguez) This shows how close-knit Rodriguez's community was, highlighting the importance of human connection. Lastly, he says that ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows how thankful he is toward his parents for sacrificing almost everything for him, demonstrating his deep appreciation. By Narciso Rodriguez wrote this in a thankful mood, expressing gratitude for the people around him. He thanks his babysitter, he thanks his community, and he thanks his parents, acknowledging their influence. All of them contributed to his life, shaping who he became and providing support when he needed it most, solidifying how grateful he is."
1585	13411	5	3	"The mood that is evident and that it is created by the author in the memoir is the feeling of being thankful. This is the mood because it says ""Their rich culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This supports the mood is thankful because author is thankful for the culinary skills that is still with him. Another that supports the mood thankful is when it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This supports the mood thankful because the author is thankful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. Another that supports the mood as thankful is when it says: ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" This supports the mood as thankful because the author is thankful for all they have done and the author could never be more courageous than them. This feeling of gratitude permeates the memoir, shaping the overall tone and leaving the reader with a sense of appreciation. This is the mood of the memoir created by the author."
1586	13412	5	3	The mood created by the author is a warm, happy mood. This is because he is talking about the love and bonds of family, highlighting the positive emotions associated with these relationships. He also is talking about home and how a house can become a home, filled with comforting memories and a sense of belonging. He also talks about how he and most people are grateful for family and friends, acknowledging the value and joy these connections bring to life. All of this blends together to form a happy, good, warm mood to the story, leaving the reader with a sense of contentment and appreciation.
1587	13413	5	3	I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness because in paragraph @NUM1, in the beginning, Narciso's parents gave up their land. This act, seemingly a sacrifice, is presented with an underlying sense of hope and optimism for a better future for their child, thereby contributing to the overall feeling of joy.
1588	13414	5	3	The mood the author was in was nostalgic & happy. The reason It was happy & nostalgic is because they talked about Being together. And living in a two bedroom apartment.
1589	13415	5	3	"In the excerpt of the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1, the mood created is one of love for family and friends. The author explains his parents' reasons for immigrating with such love and devotion that it is hard not to feel the same way. The author describes how everyone would eat together, and they often had many more people eating with them than just their immediate family. The author says ""...countless extended family members came and went..."" and then continues on to describe how his family lets other family members come stay with them until they get back on their feet, highlighting their generosity. The author really shows the mood of the excerpt in a loving way and does this the most when saying you will always be grateful to his parents for moving to @LOCATION1 for him and giving him the opportunities he has now. The author shows that he truly cares about his family, leaving the reader with a feeling of warmth and appreciation for the bonds of kinship."
1590	13416	5	3	"The mood the author creates in the memoir shows a soothing and grateful memory of the author's home and relatives. The author creates a peaceful tone representing calmness, comfort, and happiness displayed in his memories. One example of the author's way of creating a comfy and peaceful mood is in paragraph @NUM1: ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" @CAPS1 These two sentences give a deep and warm thought of family and friends along with comforting images of kitchens and sweet aromas of cooking. This type of writing gives the reader a calm mood based on the comforting words used in the sentence, such as ""passionate,"" ""aromas,"" ""innocence,"" and ""warm."" Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 where the author displays happiness and shows his gratefulness for having family and what his family has done for him, further emphasizing the positive feelings. This adds to the mood in the memoir by representing how great family is and how much it can mean to people. Overall, the author uses calming and strong words to get his images and feelings through in the memoir. Because of this, he was able to create a peaceful and comfortable mood while expressing his love for family and friends, successfully conveying a sense of warmth and appreciation."
1591	13417	5	3	The @CAPS1 mood about the story is happy. The reason why is because the story talks about how the kid learns a lot of things from his young parents. The boy learns that @CAPS3 was born in cuba but @CAPS3 had to leave to New @CAPS2 even though @CAPS3 didn't want to. @CAPS3 also learns that his mom and dad like to cook a lot together, @CAPS3 also learns that they make schedules for each other. Even though they moved to New @CAPS2 they still do what they do in cuba and they let people visit even though they don't know them, showcasing their continued warmth and openness, contributing to the overall joyful feeling.
1592	13418	5	3	"The mood created by the author was grateful. The mood is grateful because he gives thanks to his parents For ""... their love and sacrifice"" (∂@NUM1). This memoir is based on the definition of family. Rodriguez explains that Family means many things. It means helping others, accepting everyone, and for his parents giving up your life so your children could have a better one. He recalls the many people his mother and father help. The people in his neighborhood that were not related by blood but were still his family. He admired how they always opened their doors and hearts to those in need. The courage and selflessness of his parents leaving their country to start over. He tells them of his ""...admiration of their strength and perseverance"" (∂@NUM1). There is still ""no way to express my gratitude"" (∂@NUM1), he also states. He will be forever grateful to his parents for these lessons that have formed his life. The author reflects on how his parents' actions and values have shaped his own understanding of community and responsibility. Ultimately, his profound sense of thankfulness underscores the lasting impact of his parents' choices on his life."
1593	13419	5	3	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez stays constant through out the story. First, ""growing up in this environment in stilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative"". This quote talks about when Narciso's mom and dad take people in their house that need a home, but they are not blood relative family. Second, ""my mother and father came to this country not knowing the culture of language to give me a better life."" Even though his mom and dad knew nothing about the language or culture in America, and didn't want to leave friends and family, Narciso's mother and father sacrificed it all to give Narciso a better life. Finally, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Narciso means that its a simple house but it turned into a safe home with all the people Narciso loves around him. All in all, the mood of this memoir is happy, showcasing a sense of gratitude and appreciation. The author makes all his challenges happy, reflecting on the positive aspects of his upbringing and family's sacrifices, ultimately contributing to an overall uplifting tone."
1594	13420	5	3	I think this is the Childhood memoir. This memoir is about a young girl that tells about her life and her parents life. It is saying when did her parents emigrate from Cuba to the United States in 1956. It says when she was born in 1961 and she is saying she was born in a simple house. This memoir is saying about the little girl's family when did they emigrate and where did they lived, giving the reader insight into their experiences.
1595	13421	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez the author sets a mood of relaxation, happiness, joy, and an overall feeling of over satisfaction and unity. The author describes his feelings of being at his home and how much it made him feel overjoyed. In paragraph one it says ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" In this particular sentence the author is trying to get the mood across as like a heaven on earth thing. The author while trying to give the reader factual information about his home, is also trying to exaggerate the emotion and make it paradise. In paragraphs two, three and four the author emphasizes how courageous, kind, and selfless his parents are and how he will always be grateful to them for that. He shows it in statements like ""They came selflessly...to give their children a better life"" and ""Generosity and selflessness are two lessons my parents did not just tell me. They showed me their lives."" The author sets the mood in the story as paradise for everyone, creating a sense of idyllic family life rooted in love and sacrifice."
1596	13422	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir is unity, as shown in paragraph @NUM1: ""Our neighborhood was made mostly up of Spanish, Cuban, and other immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. Secondly, they had courage, as shown in paragraph @NUM2: ""My mother and my father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language and culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, careers, and the country they loved."" This sense of unity, born from shared experience and courageous decisions, permeates the memoir and is the mood created by the memoir."
1597	13423	5	3	"The mood created by the **HOUSE** in the memoir. First at the end of the memoir **the author** was **nostalgic**. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" **This** nostalgic one is, ""it' was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my First birthday."" My **second** mood that I am going to tell you about is like an I don't care; it is **indifference**. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""Family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" **These** are my moods created by the **HOUSE** in the memoir. Therefore, through nostalgia and indifference, the house serves as a powerful symbol of the author's experiences and evolving understanding of family."
1598	13424	5	3	"The EXPERIENCE Created in the NARRATIVE is Not that of a SOMBER one. The EXPERIENCE Created is cheerful and happy, as the narrator talks about his family and childhood. The NARRATOR talks about how his Neighborhood consisted of many races, as stated in paragraph 1 ""Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants."" The NARRATOR talks about how they all live together in peace and HARMONY. This PORTRAYAL SUGGESTS that the meaning of family does not necessarily mean you have to be related. The EXPERIENCE is happy and SUGGESTS that friends are family too, highlighting the positive influence of community."
1599	13425	5	3	The mood that was created by the author in the memoir was happiness, love, unity, and satisfaction. These words describe the mood because in the memoir the author would talk about how eternally grateful he is for his family. He talked about the struggles they had but how they saw past them and realized that as long as they have each other that's all that matters. They got along great and were very happy they had each other, highlighting their strong bond. They also helped other people in need which seemed to complete their lives, giving them a sense of purpose. They saw everyone as family and as little as they had, all they wanted was to give back. This sense of fulfillment and generosity is what defines the mood created by the author, leaving the reader with a feeling of warmth and contentment.
1600	13426	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy, proud of his parents and proud to be a Cuban. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He understands the enormity of their choice. His parents gave up their wonderful jobs in Cuba and now are working jobs that they don't like in order to provide a better life for him. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 Narciso says that this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with a blood relative. This demonstrates the strong sense of community and belonging he felt. Narciso is grateful for his parents and grateful for being in @LOCATION1, acknowledging the opportunities afforded to him there. Ultimately, the memoir radiates positivity, rooted in appreciation for family, heritage, and the chance for a new beginning."
1601	13427	5	3	"The memoir has a very happy mood to it. Paragraph @NUM1 gives a real feeling for what the author's home was like, vividly depicting the sights and smells. It talks about the food and the music that the author emphasises his love for, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. Paragraphs @NUM2 and @NUM3 give information on how close the community was, highlighting the strong bonds between neighbours. The author talks about how great his friend Alegria was and says she ""graced"" their kitchen with her presence and laughter. Throughout the memoir, the author explains how happy his home was, and with his detailed descriptions and heartfelt anecdotes, the reader gets a feel for the happiness too, understanding the author's deep affection for his upbringing."
1602	13428	5	3	"The mood of the author and the memoir was happy. He or she seemed proud of everything about theirselves. He or she didn't let anyone stand in their way of their culture, home, and parents. For example the author said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" When i read that last sentence of the whole memoir I understood what feeling the author was getting. He or she was in all kinds of moods. Some was happy, some was grateful, and some was exciting. The mood the author was in made me realize that I need to appreciate what I got. In my home, in my school, everywhere and everyone around me. The mood of the author in the memoir was grateful and happy, showcasing a deep appreciation for their roots."
1603	13429	5	3	"This article @PERSON1 has created a different mood for me. I was first bored but now I'm more grateful of my parents. My parents had also moved from a different country to the United States. They moved from @LOCATION2 to here @CAPS1 so the children could have a better life and education. This article also says that close friends can also be family and now that I think about it, I think it's true. The author says ""growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being blood relatives."" That's the kind of mood this author created for me as I read this memoir, making me appreciate both my family's sacrifices and the chosen family I've found."
1604	13430	5	3	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the most important thing is love. It talks about how much Narciso cares for his family. The mood is love, admiration, and gratefulness. Narciso is so grateful for what his parents did for him, to give up everything to go to a better place. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" says Narciso, highlighting the profound impact of their decision. Another mood is also love. In the memoir, it expresses a great deal of love that's in his family. "".. It meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"". They gave up everything for Narciso, who they truly love. You get the feel of admiration when Narciso says ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life,"" demonstrating the deep respect he holds for their values. The overall feelings of the memoir are love, admiration, and gratefulness. Narciso learned a lot from his family. ""I will never forget how my parents turned his simple house into a home,"" underscoring the theme of love that permeated their lives. Thus, love, admiration, and gratefulness are truly the central themes that define Narciso's narrative."
1605	13431	5	3	In this memoir the author gives the mood a sense of inspiration, as well as the love of family and friends. In the memoir the author talks about how great it is that the author's parents had turned a simple ordinary house into a home, which means that the author's parents had made thier house to feel like home by bringing their Cuban culture into the house, such as Cuban food, Cuban music, and Cuban decoration, filling it with warmth. That makes the memoir a happy mood. But there is also inspiration to this memoir because it basically tells readers that it doesn't matter who your blood relatives are, family is family, people who love and care about you the most, showing that love transcends bloodlines and creates genuine bonds, thus solidifying the memoir's inspirational and heartwarming tone.
1606	13432	5	3	The mood of this memoir is very happy and loving. Throughout the story, Narciso shows how much he appreciates that his parents gave him the opportunity to grow up in Guadalajara. He shows that this memoir is loving by explaining how his mom and dad always had their arms and doors open to anybody they considered family. The memoir is happy because it shows that he has a lot of good relations with many people that he calls family, extending beyond just blood relatives to encompass close friends and neighbors. He is also happy because he knows how much it takes to move from your home country to America. Overall, Narciso had a very happy, loving childhood, filled with strong familial bonds and a deep appreciation for the sacrifices made to build a new life.
1607	13433	5	3	The mood created by The author is happy and warm tone. In paragraph @NUM1 he recalls enjoying cuban music and learning to cook. He also recalls making friends with other imigrants and learning to love and help everyone; this demonstrates his open heart. In paragraph @NUM3 he recalls learning the true meaning of family and what it means to make house, a home. The mood created is warm and loving and teaches the true meaning of family and of selfless behavior and that home is about The family, not the space, showing the reader what truly matters.
1608	13434	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir was happiness and satisfaction. I know this because in the story the main character is happy. As he arrives in New Jersey he enjoys how his parents create their house looking like a traditional Cuban home. He is passionate of the Cuban music that he adores listening too everyday. Another thing is that the main character is satisfied of what his parents do for him. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The last thing is that he is thankful to his parents because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""@CAPS1 often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. I've told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thank them repeatedly."" These details contribute to an overall feeling of contentment and appreciation, solidifying the mood of happiness and satisfaction that the author successfully conveys throughout the memoir."
1609	13435	5	3	The mood created in Rodriguez's memoir is one of gratefulness + happiness. There are supporting feelings such as coziness + friendlyness but Rodriguez himself most exhibits gratefulness. In paragraph @NUM1, there is a great catalogue of gratefulness to the social skills that were passed down to him, specifically noting their importance. When in paragraph @NUM2 he talks about their cuban feast, a small one perhaps but with true love + life, the warmth is palpable. You get a true sense of the gratefulness Rodriguez displays for his parents not because of who they are or how much money they have or what they give him (materialistically), but being genuinely grateful of the nature + kindness bestowed to him, shaping his character and worldview. Ultimately, this gratefulness underscores the memoir's overall positive and appreciative tone.
1610	13436	5	3	The mood of this memoir is loving. It's TELLING you how you should look back at your home and your family. They all love you and how you love all of them. How every one was always there for everyone, a constant source of support and affection. This memoir encourages a perspective of gratitude and fondness, highlighting the unwavering bonds of family and the warmth of a loving home.
1611	13437	5	3	"In the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives @PERSON1 he makes the mood seem loving, cheerful, and grateful. The mood is grateful to Rodriguez's parents for making his house more of a home among other things. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 his parents did a ton for Rodriguez and he is constantly grateful for their efforts. There is also a lot of love in the mood of the book because there are lots of mentions of family. In paragraph @NUM2 it says ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family."" @CAPS2 arms opened and a big ""family"" are surely signs of lots of love and acceptance. The mood of the excerpt is also cheerful because as Rodriguez says ""Passionate salsa music filled the air."" And ""a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air."" Music and feasting are two of the most cheerful things there are, evoking a sense of joy and celebration. By recalling experiences from his childhood @PERSON2 manages to make the mood of his memoir loving, grateful, and cheerful all at the same time."
1612	13438	5	3	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author creates a positive, greatful mood. The author ""will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I know because @CAPS1 writes a few paragraphs just to show how thankful the author is to his parents. @CAPS1 describes how great their jobs were in Cuba and then how poor they became in the @LOCATION1, but yet they still worked hard to give their children a better life, never losing hope. ""In a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country where I celebrated my first birthdays,"" which highlights their generosity. @CAPS1 describes everything as a positive learning experience and shows that throughout the memoir, the theme is positive and greatful, demonstrating resilience and appreciation."
1613	13439	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir feels sad. Because in Cuba, his parents, had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find, a difficult and humbling experience. In the author's memoir, he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice, recognizing the hardships they endured for the sake of their family's future.
1614	13440	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is gratitude. Narciso is so grateful and proud to have grown up where he did and have the family he had. ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" Narciso is telling the readers that even though the people in his neighborhood were all different, they were still family, a sentiment that clearly fills him with thankfulness. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote tells you that even though things were rough he still is grateful for all the opportunities his parents gave him, highlighting the profound appreciation he feels for their efforts in creating a loving environment. His reflections underscore the enduring power of gratitude in shaping his life's narrative."
1615	13441	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy for remembering the most important people in his life, the humble house where he lived when he had his first birthday, and the unique individuals in the place where his family resided. He was grateful for everything his parents gave him when he was a little boy and the education they provided. This gratitude reflects a deep appreciation for his roots and the foundation they built for him.
1616	13442	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez's memoir creates an overall mood of love and compassion for family and shows the strength of his own family. Narcisco explains that his parents' love of cooking and willingness to let other people in ""instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" He emphasizes the importance of chosen family. Also, this memoir shows people facing hardships. Narciso explains his neighborhood and family overcame racism together, and supported one another. This sets the mood that they love each other. Lastly, this memoir shows love and sacrifice. Narciso explains that his parents ""struggled both personally and financially"" during their move to @LOCATION1. But Narciso's parents still showed him love through their actions and support. From his parents, Narciso has learned to love, and for that, he admires his parents, ultimately shaping his own capacity for deep connection and appreciation."
1617	13443	5	3	Based on the author in @CAPS1, the mood created was both happy and sad. The author created a happy mood because Narciso Rodriguez lived comfortably in a neighborhood of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. At that time, there was no racism or segregation, and he lived peacefully at home. However, the author also evokes sadness because, while Narciso Rodriguez learned about love and the definition of family, he felt he would never understand how parents turn a house into a simple home, which suggests a sense of longing and perhaps a lack of that specific experience. Ultimately, the contrasting elements of a loving community and a missing familial component contribute to the mixed, complex mood the author crafts.
1618	13444	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez the author's mood is happy, and he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He loves his family and friends oh so dearly. He is also grateful to have a lot of his family members who are close to him that could get together for dinner and a lot more. The author says ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music life and love."" As you can see in the memoir the author felt happy and grateful for the love and sacrifice of his family, showing a deep appreciation for his roots and the people who shaped him."
1619	13445	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez is an internationally recognized clothing designer. He talks about his hometown in Newark, New Jersey. In the memoir, he offers the true definition of ""family"". I felt like the mood was comforting, and loving, and heart-warming, especially by the way he talks about his Cuban heritage. His mother and father immigrated from Cuba to Newark, and even at a young age, they still managed to raise him, and do a lot for him, giving him the best childhood they could give him, that he'll always remember. He also talks about how ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" meaning that you could even consider someone not blood related to you, as your own flesh and blood, family, illustrating the profound impact of community and shared experience on his understanding of kinship. This emphasis highlights the warmth and inclusivity that defined his upbringing."
1620	13446	5	3	I think he has a really great life and he's a happy person. And also he appreciates what happens in his life, both the good times and perhaps even the challenges, recognizing their value in shaping him. This appreciation, combined with his positive outlook, likely contributes to his overall contentment and sense of well-being.
1621	13447	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is love, caring, and thankfulness. I say this because she really appriciates what her parents have done for her. In CHAPTER 1, she says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice, my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" Also, ""it was a close knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were really in need.""; CHAPTER 2. This shows that Narciso and her family can trust the people in their community which is a thankful mood. Because they know that they would never do anything to hurt them. In the last CHAPTER 6, it says ""it was here where I learned the real definition of family and I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows how thankful, loving, and caring he is to his parents. Narciso is proud of his parents because they let people stay with them, when they need to. This highlights the author's deep appreciation and solidifies the overall mood of love, care, and thankfulness that permeates the memoir."
1622	13448	5	3	The author created the mood of love and caring. They always cared about other people, offering a listening ear and a helping hand whenever needed. This genuine empathy permeated their actions and words, fostering a sense of warmth and connection. Ultimately, the author's caring nature shaped the narrative, leaving a lasting impression of human kindness.
1623	13449	5	3	"The mood created by the author of the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is generally a happy and memorable one. The author describes how his parents came to @LOCATION1, specifically the United States, and had to start all over. However, the author's parents are still very kind and turn their neighborhood into one big family. The parents cook and celebrate things with the neighbors. The author says he is very proud that his parents were such caring people. The mood of this story is overall very happy, sharing, caring, and grateful because of how nice the parents were. The author states ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is a very inspiring and happy memoir to read, with the mood to match it."
1624	13450	5	3	In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, there is a mood of joy, and hope. His parents came to New Jersey in a time of racial segregation. They persevered through the hard time with their child by having close bonds with friends and family that lived nearby. Culture was passed on to Narciso and he loved the art and music he grew up with. Narciso's parents always invited family into their home when they needed help. Also, many people that weren't related to them shared dinner with them each night. In the Rodriguez's home, there was hope to get better and joy for the moment.
1625	13451	5	3	The mood in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir seems happy. When the author talks about these memoirs, they appear to feel happy having those memories to share. It's evident when the author recalls their parents and the house they lived in, and how these recollections evoke a sense of their continued presence. So, if I were in the author's shoes, I would feel good about how I was raised by my parents to live in a better place, even if that means giving up a lot of things that mean a lot to you. That feeling of gratitude and contentment seems to be the author's overall mood.
1626	13452	5	3	I think it was a proud mood because she is saying what her parents did for her, detailing their sacrifices and hard work to provide her with opportunities they never had. This feeling of pride likely stems from gratitude and admiration for their unwavering support.
1627	13453	5	3	"The author creates a grateful mood in the memoir. For example in paragraph 1 the second sentence the author states ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows that the author is grateful enough to have parents even though they are not his biological blood related parents. In paragraph 3 in the first two sentences the author is talking about how his parents came to this country with courage and without speaking the language or knowing the culture. He also mentioned in those sentences how to give their children a better life meant leaving behind families, friends and careers in their original country. This shows that the author is also generous because he realizes the love and sacrifice it takes to do this. Also, In paragraph 5 sentence two he says that he has told his parents that what they did was brave because he would have never been able to do what they did. It really displays how grateful the author is, and how much he admires his parents, ultimately highlighting the profound appreciation he holds for their sacrifices and love."
1628	13454	5	3	"The author created many feelings in the memoir. First, the author created a warm and loving mood; ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows how much passion is behind his families love and it makes you feel warm and comfortable inside. Second, some feelings the author also creates are friendly and caring; ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship."" This shows how friendship was very important and gives off a friendly and caring feeling to the reader, emphasizing the strong bonds formed within the community. Lastly, the author created a very happy and upbeat feeling in the begining of the memoir; ""Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote shows that the author's family celebrated life and created upbeat feelings. In conclusion, the author of the memoir created many feelings for the reader."
1629	13455	5	3	"In this memoir written by Narciso Rodriguez, he portrayed a very specific mood. This mood made me feel that I was there, or part of the story that he was telling. I felt this way because by familiarizing your readers with your characters, that makes writing the rest of the story a lot easier. For example, in paragraph two, I was able to get a sense of what his home and family life was like-especially with this line, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" One line that I felt was special to the story was, ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who... were clearly in need"" I liked this statement especially because it showed me, as the reader, how caring those people were, which helped to shape my understanding. It also brightened the mood of the whole story, adding a touch of hope and positivity. The overall mood of this memoir, I feel, was clearly depicted, successfully drawing the reader into the author's world."
1630	13456	5	3	"@CAPS1 Rodriguez, in the excerpt from Home: the @CAPS2 of our Lives, evokes a nostalgic mood. Throughout the excerpt @CAPS4 recalls all the feasts, parties and guests @CAPS4 had at the ""simple house"" his parents turned ""into a home"" as stated in @CAPS3 @NUM1. This tells me that the author had very good memories at the house @CAPS4 loved and grew up in. The author also gives off a very compassionate mood. In @CAPS3 @NUM2 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS4 describes his community as ""close-knit"" and ""honest."" This tells me that the author was very similar to his community and loved all of them and was grateful his parents took their time to make his life the best they could. The mood is lastly @CAPS5. In @CAPS3 @NUM3 it says his community ""extended a hand to people who were clearly in need."" @CAPS4 calls his parents actions of coming to @LOCATION1 ""courageous."" @CAPS4 takes pride in his Cuban family and @ORGANIZATION1 and all of the immigrants @CAPS4 grew up around, which tells me @CAPS4 knows they accomplished a big feat in their lives. Those are the moods set by the author, revealing a deep appreciation for his upbringing and heritage."
1631	13457	5	3	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, many moods were shown and created in the memoir. One mood shown in the memoir is great love. In paragraph three, Narciso wrote, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" Another mood described in Narciso's memoir was gratitude. In the final paragraph, the author wrote, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" A last mood produced in the memoir was pride. In paragraph two, Narciso wrote, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" Indeed, these positive emotions were richly created by Narciso Rodriguez in his great family memoir."
1632	13458	5	3	"In this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives*, the author beautifully creates a positive, happy mood. Throughout most of the memoir, the mood is very warm and hearty. The author's description of how his home came to be and how it's like warms up the atmosphere of the reader's mind and makes them smile unknowingly. For example, the last sentence of paragraph 1, it says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The author's diction, or choice of words, such as *congregation*, *celebration* and *warm home* creates imagery of happy, joyful house and gives off a positive effect. In addition, he boosts up the warm, soothing mood up a notch by saying in paragraph 2 ""... All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants."" By saying this, this sentence sets up a feeling of being supported by your loved ones and shows a real definition of true family. Also, it sends a warm, relaxing, cozy feeling as the author talks about a loving, caring family. For this memoir, the author created a heartwarming, joyous, warm mood as he described his loving home and provided a real definition of family. A loving family really sets a warm, hearty mood."
1633	13459	5	3	"In the story Narciso Rodriguez the mood of the author created was very peaceful. It was saying how it was a traditional Cuban home and there was passionate Cuban music that filled the air, often with the sounds of a lively rumba. There was also the mixing of the aromas in the air coming from the kitchen, hints of garlic, spices, and simmering sauces all blending together. There's tons of loving people around the house too, creating a strong sense of community. Which makes it home and comfortable. The mood was always happy and everyone loved to cook so they would always do that together even though they weren't blood related, sharing recipes and laughter as they worked. ""Within the walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, every heart of it was in the kitchen."" As you can tell this family loves being together and enjoys each other's company, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. This collective love and shared joy solidify the peaceful and happy mood conveyed in the story."
1634	13460	5	3	The mood was great, filled with laughter and easy conversation. Everyone seemed relaxed and genuinely happy to be there, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere.
1635	13461	5	3	In this article, the author's mood seemed to be happy and good. For example, he likes that his parents are selfish and hard-working people and tried to make his life happy. He also liked how they would invite a lot of people to come over for a visit and how they treated them like family, offering them food and drinks. He also likes how they taught him things that they know how to do, such as cooking traditional Cuban dishes. His mood did seem to change when he talked about how in Cuba having a job was a bit easier than how it was in New Jersey, where they faced challenges finding stable employment. They tried to make as much as they could, and his mood seemed to be a bit worried about their financial struggles. His mood changed to be happy again when he mentioned that he loves the way they treat their house like a real home, filled with warmth and love. Ultimately, the author conveys a sense of gratitude and appreciation for his upbringing, despite the hardships they faced.
1636	13462	5	3	"The author creates a very happy, but curious mood towards the reader. The reading made me happy for Narciso, but curious on how much his parents had to struggle to give Narciso the best life he could get. For example the author states that his parents had to ""start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find."" Back in Cuba, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria (Narciso mom) had studied chemical engineering."" This shows how much his parents lost due to immigrating to America. This made me wonder why they would do this. They did it because they wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also the author creates a sad emotion, by saying, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and may never see them again. Such sacrifice highlights the profound love and hope driving their decision to seek a better future, demonstrating the author's skill in evoking complex emotions. The author creates a variety of different moods throughout the memoir."
1637	13463	5	3	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Narciso Rodriguez, there are several ways in which the author created the mood. For instance, when the author states how his family is from Cuba and they were able to move to a modest apartment. The author states, ""Ö originally from CubaÖ could afford to move into a modestÖ apartment I would soon call home"" (@NUM1). This quote shows that the author's parents wanted to give him a good life. They did this by moving themselves and him to @LOCATION2. Another example occurs when the author describes what his kitchen ""heart of the house"" is like and how even though they are in New Jersey, their house still feels like Cuba. The author says, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (@NUM2). This quote demonstrates that the author's family made sure he still knew what Cuba is like, preserving their heritage. The author's parents wanted to show him both sides of the world (Cuba and @LOCATION2). Last, when the author says how grateful he is about his parents and the way he grew up. The author says, ""Ö I learned the real definition of ""family""Ö I learned there how to love"" (@NUM3). This quote shows that the author has learned all the important skills in life. Thanks to his family, he now knows how to love and treat everyone with respect. Clearly, through details of family, heritage, and gratitude, there are many ways the author created the mood for the excerpt."
1638	13464	5	3	"Based on a memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a specific mood is created. First, the author tells about a love of cooking in the kitchen with his family and the meaningful Cuban dishes prepared there. This creates an atmosphere of passion. Rodriguez describes, ""passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (paragraph @NUM1). This quote shows the passion the author has for his culture and traditions, a deep-seated love evident in his vivid description. Second, the author talks about the relationship he has with this neighborhood. A mood of passion is created based on the author's loving emotions towards his unofficial family. The author writes, ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family"" (paragraph @NUM2). This generosity and warmth cultivated a passionate community bond. Finally, the author shares his gratitude towards his parents and all that they have done for him. His passion for their strength, perseverance, and teachings create a passionate atmosphere. The author says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM3). This deep appreciation highlights the passionate foundation upon which he built his life. Throughout Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, a passionate mood is displayed, rooted in family, culture, and profound gratitude."
1639	13465	5	3	"In 'Narciso Rodriguez,' the author creates mood in several ways. The mood created by the author is a warm, happy mood that associates with feelings of family and love. The first place we can see this mood is in paragraph four where the narrator tells us ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows that everyone in their community loved each other and helped each other, which added to the mood of family and love. The narrator also tells us of his parents that ""they came selflessly, as most immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" This sacrifice highlights their devotion. This shows that the narrator's parents loved him so much that they wanted the absolute best for him no matter where it took them. This shows they feel family is very important to them adding to the mood of family created by the author. The final place this mood can be seen is when the narrator tells us that he would ""always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and that it was from his parents that he ""learned the real definition of family."" This gratitude emphasizes the strong bond. This shows how much he loved and respected his parents which added to the warm, loving mood. In 'Narciso Rodriguez' several things used by the author create a warm mood of family and love."
1640	13466	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is comforting. His memoir shows his past life and how he felt about it. Cuban music filled the air, tables of Cuban feasts, different kinds of people interacting, all that is the mood he's trying to express about his life through his memoir. He's also showing his appreciation for his parents for making sacrifices for him so he could have more opportunities and education. He's also being very descriptive about his childhood and showing the type of life he had and what he and his parents had to go through when they came to @LOCATION1 and how they don't want people going through the same thing as them, so they helped immigrants who needed support. The author's nostalgic descriptions evoke a sense of warmth, painting a picture of resilience and community, ultimately crafting a comforting mood throughout the memoir.
1641	13467	5	3	"The mood is obviously love and greatfulness (""and for which I am eternally grateful""). The boy is young, so he doesn't quite grasp how monumental that move was for them. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, finding new jobs and a house. This meant leaving family, friends, their home, and everything familiar to provide a better life for their son. He is thankful that his parents were still able to keep his Cuban heritage alive, never forgetting their roots. Now that he thinks about it, a thread of sadness weaves through his feelings; he was, in a way, the catalyst for that upheaval. What if he had never been born? Would his parents have ever discovered the profound meaning of family in the way they did? That's why this memoir resonates with greatfulness, love, and that subtle undercurrent of sadness, a complex tapestry of emotions woven together by sacrifice and devotion."
1642	13468	5	3	The mood they created in the author in the memoir was very different from other people. We all have different mood swings, but some people have the same and it never changes. One way you need to change this is how you act around others and how to get to know them the way they are around everyone, not just with friends. This understanding helps foster empathy and adjust expectations, leading to more authentic and meaningful connections. Ultimately, recognizing individual differences in emotional expression is key to building stronger relationships and navigating social interactions more effectively.
1643	13469	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 is happy & warm. The memoir is happy & warm because it describes how a small home can be very happy; like in paragraph @NUM1, it says ""always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" This shows that love fills the air which is happy, reinforcing the overall warm feeling. That is how the author creates a mood."
1644	13470	5	3	"Home The Blueprints of our Lives is a warm tribute to the parents of Narciso Rodriguez. The author of this memoir had said, ""Growing up in this environment istilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Narciso Rodriguez would change the way a reader would perceive this memoir. It would be a story of a young child who has perceived the physical and mental qualities of adults. Narciso acknowledges the troubles Narciso and his parents are in. For his neighborhood including his family being immigrants, in a time of racism and segregation, Narciso learned how to appreciate this ""close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants."" Narciso understood how Narciso Rodriguez Sr, and his wife struggled personally and financially. Narciso became grateful for his opportunity to live in this Cuban home of Newark, New Jersey. Though his parents had worked in a laboratory and studied chemical engineering, they struggle to find work in financial times. Narciso adores them. The author writes, ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" Without these relationships, and the lives of various people, this memoir would be a selfish story of a child. Narciso appreciates everything the family has done. There was too much generosity impressed upon a boy of such an early age. Narciso had learned how to respect his parents. In the end, Narciso Rodriguez would write a memoir devoted to the bonds Narciso created with his parents and the refugees amongst them, demonstrating that family is built on love and support, not just blood."
1645	13471	5	3	"In this memoir the author has created more than just one mood. He has, in my opinion, created around three: love, gratitude, and caring. The mood of love was created because in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez tells us that family isn't just blood relatives. It can be anyone. In his case his whole neighborhood was his family, extending the definition of familial bonds beyond traditional limits. Family can be anyone and to me family is or can be people that you love. That is how the mood of love was created by the author. When I read the memoir and got near the end, I personally felt the mood of gratitude. I felt that because the author is grateful for all the things his parents did for him, one example is when his parents left their hometown so that their son could have a better life, showcasing their sacrifice. My parents did that for me, so I could relate on a personal level. I know I'm grateful for them making that big decision. I also think the mood of caring was created. I think that because in the memoir the author says that his parents would let people live with them until ""they got back on their feet,"" providing support to those in need. I felt as if the family was caring doing that, its not like anyone would do that, so the family was caring. That is why I felt the mood caring was created by the author. In conclusion, the memoir effectively evokes feelings of love, gratitude, and caring through the author's reflections on family, sacrifice, and generosity."
1646	13472	5	3	"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez speaks with nothing but warm fondness and gratitude as she describes her childhood home. The loving way she talks about her parents' apartment and their kitchen and the Cuban culture they combined into their everyday lives suggest that Narciso has wonderful memories of her parents. Obviously, she is very grateful for everything her parents did for her and the chance for her to grow up in such a tender community - where ""'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The memoir is filled with these touching reflections. The entire memoir is written with such care and attention to sweet detail. The author clearly feels blessed that her parents sacrificed their safety in their homeland to bring her to America in order for her to live a better life, to experience the importance of friends and family, and to learn about the true meaning of love through Cuban culture. Thus, the memoir acts as a sincere and heartfelt tribute to her upbringing."
1647	13473	5	3	I think @CAPS1 mood in this @CAPS2 was @CAPS3 was @CAPS4 and glad @CAPS3 grew up with such good Parents and How There not self ish, truly reflecting a positive upbringing and admirable character.
1648	13474	5	3	I think that the mood that the author created was unpleasant. One, because he lived in a one-room apartment, so that must mean that they are poor, and that they live in a poor town without any food, contributing to the overall sense of hardship and despair.
1649	13475	5	3	The mood in this memoir is one of gratitude. This is first seen in paragraph @NUM1 when he talks about cooking and Cuban music, appreciating the simple joys that connect him to his heritage. It is also in paragraph @NUM2 when he talks about leaving their home country, expressing thankfulness for the opportunity for a new life despite the difficulties of leaving everything behind. A third time is seen in paragraph @NUM3 when he tries to say thank you, but can't find the right words, revealing a deep sense of appreciation that transcends simple expression. The mood in this memoir is gratitude and it is easiest to see in paragraphs @NUM1, @NUM2, and @NUM3, demonstrating the author's profound thankfulness for the experiences that have shaped his life.
1650	13476	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir could be strong to many people once they put it together. Narciso's parents started off in a home that meant nothing. However, Narciso's parents turned it into something great through hard work and love. In the last sentence of the memoir Narciso states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" What he was trying to explain was your home is what you make of it. That is what I believe the mood created by the author in the memoir is: a sense of hope and the power of family to transform even the most humble beginnings."
1651	13477	5	3	The mood that the author created in the memoir was very thankful. He was very thankful for his parents coming to the United States from Cuba. The opportunities it gave him, such as a better education and the chance to be successful, were clearly appreciated. In the memoir, he expressed gratitude for all the people that helped him in this new country and supported him and his family, as he also showed thankfulness to the people that supported him. Thankful was the mood that Narciso Rodriguez showed in this memoir, demonstrating a deep appreciation for the sacrifices and support that shaped his life.
1652	13478	5	3	The author created the memoir because he remembers other people, the family that doesn't live with us. The author reminds us about the culture and other stuff. The author created the memoir of Narciso because he is talking about family, specifically highlighting their importance and connection through shared memories and experiences. In doing so, the memoir serves as a way to preserve and share those familial bonds.
1653	13479	5	3	"The mood created by the memoir is joyous, gratefullness, and overall feeling of the story. One reason would be the mood of celebrations with his families and friends; from paragraph 1 ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Also the mood is gratefulness by how the family keeps the arms Open for people who need help because they knew that their friends/family would do the same; from paragraph 2 ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" There was also a depressing mood because Narciso family had to move from their friends and jobs to have a better life for the child/son; from paragraph 3 ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Also they're grateful and Admiration to do what they did came their; from paragraph 4 ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The moods created by this memoir filled the heart with depressing laungauge, gratefulness, joyous, and admiration of the memoir, showcasing a complex tapestry of emotions woven through the narrative."
1654	13480	5	3	"The author of the memoir creates a very grateful and happy mood. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" The author APPRECIATES what his parents did for him. He knows it was hard for his parents to leave their country for him. ""They struggled both personally and financially... I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author UNDERSTANDS what his parents' struggles that allowed him to grow up the way he did and allowing him to have the life he did meant to him. He admires his parents for being as brave as they were. The author HIGHLIGHTS in his writing what it is his parents did for him, means to him. Narciso Rodriguez is grateful for his parents. ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast... always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" The author SHOWS how his parents brought him up in a happy way. He EMPHASIZES how his parents showed him love. Narciso Rodriguez is grateful, proud, and happy for his parents, and his memoir expresses that sentiment clearly and effectively."
1655	13481	5	3	"Throughout the passage, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the author displays many moods in his writing. One of the moods of the story is love. That his family filled their home with things they loved, like the food they ate and the music they played. And they also loved the people in their family. Not their real family but the people in their neighborhood that they considered family. And they would always have people eat over and stay over if they needed to. And the other mood of the story is being grateful. That Narciso Rodriguez was grateful that his parents gave up everything to come to @LOCATION1 so he could have a good life. That they gave up all their friends, family, jobs, and the country they loved so he could have a good life. And he was grateful for all the things that they taught him. It is clear that these emotions resonate deeply within him, shaping his perspective and influencing his narrative. And that is the mood of the story."
1656	13482	5	3	"Living with his immigrated parents in the United States, the author created a warm and appreciative mood with the memoir. First, in paragraph @NUM1, Narciso explains that part of the warmth in his home is by having endless celebrations with family and friends. Also, in paragraph @NUM2 he stated, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" Finally, he has mentioned that he has learned the real definition of ""family"" and about how to love in his own home, showcasing a deep sense of gratitude and familial love. In conclusion, the author created a heartwarming and thankful mood while talking about his experiences in the memoir."
1657	13483	5	3	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" written by The Creators of our lives, the mood in the memoir is emotional & loving. In this story the designer talks about how his parents are immigrants. How his parents were nice enough to let people stay in their home & how they helped people with them, showing the designer's deep appreciation for his upbringing."
1658	13484	5	3	The author that wrote this story created a lot of mood. First, the story created a lot of love. For example in paragraph @NUM1 his parents had to leave all that they loved. They had to leave their country, family, friends, and their careers. His parents left behind so much. Secondly, there is a lot of gratefulness in the story. For example in paragraph @NUM2 Narciso is very grateful for what his parent had to give up and for their love. He also said that what they did was more courageous than something that he could have ever done. Thirdly, there is a lot of sadness and generosity. Narciso is stating how impressed and generous his parents were and he realizes how important friends and family are in paragraph @NUM2. Narciso also states in paragraph @NUM2 that the two lessons that he learn wasn't just taught, but were shown by his parents lives. I think that this story was very touching and created a lot of mood and emotion as I was reading, ultimately making it a very impactful piece of writing.
1659	13485	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is a warm and happy one. He does this by talking about homes, friendship and his neighborhood. He creates this happy feeling by talking about his home. He talks about his simple house in which was created a cuban home. His kitchen has aromas of food filling the air. The rich skill of cooking was passed on to him. In this house he had the innocence of childhood. The second way he creates a happy mood is talking about friendship. He talked about how his land lords daughter was his friend and babysitter. This led to a playful warm tone as he lead to his grandparents who also enjoyed a meal at his house. The last way is talking about his neighborhood. He talked about how the immigrants in his neighborhood all helped each other. They all came to America hardworking and willing. The author also wrote that family doesn't need blood. Those are the ways that the author created a happy mood in the memoir, weaving together a heartwarming narrative through the lens of home, friendship, and community.
1660	13486	5	3	The mood that was created by the author was a warm feeling because the text describes pride and gratefulness. Also, it gives a comforting and secure sense of a good family relationship. The author also puts feeling into his writing, using descriptive language to convey these emotions. Those are the feelings that the author describes, ultimately leaving the reader with a sense of contentment.
1661	13487	5	3	"After reading the selection ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1 I have decided that as a child @PERSON1 seemed to have a very fun life. Also the memoir seemed to have a good mood to it. One thing that made the mood good was all the talking about parties and celebrations they had. I like parties and thinking about parties during @CAPS1 makes it a little less @CAPS2 racking. Another thing that sets a good mood is a talk about how Narciso's parents are always upbeat and ready for anything life throws at them. The final thing that makes the selection have a very good mood is how Narciso talks about all his family and friends and the strong bonds they share. When I think of good memories of my family and friends it always brings a smile to my face. Overall this memoir made me feel good and brightened my day, reminding me of the importance of family, friends, and finding joy in celebrations."
1662	13488	5	3	The mood set by the author is thankful. The author says that he is happy to have his parents. He thanks them for giving him a life in America, but still carrying out their Cuban ways. He was happy to have others come into his apartment and sit down and act like family. He likes that his parents are selfless and that they care about others. He also enjoyed learning to cook, which he adores to this day. He cherishes the values they instilled and the warmth they shared. Thus, the author's gratitude extends beyond mere existence, encompassing the rich cultural heritage and familial love that shaped his life.
1663	13489	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir is to show how to be grateful and appreciate what you have in life. Like in the memoir, Narciso lives in an apartment with one bedroom, but he loved it there; there was and is good memories. Narciso quotes on page @NUM1, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are."" That quote told everything, the whole mood of the story, and the very last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" truly encapsulates the overall theme of gratitude and appreciation, completing the author's intended mood."
1664	13490	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood of appreciation and happiness. Rodriguez does this by starting with background, and by the end moving to the lessons Rodriguez learned from his parents. First, Rodriguez describes how wonderful this environment was in paragraph one. ""My young parents created a traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen... My parents passed on to me... a love of cooking that is still with me today (for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air..."" Rodriguez continues by describing how wonderful a place to grow up it was and how his parents showed him generosity. Next, Rodriguez says how hard it was for his parents to leave everything they knew, just for their children. He states in paragraph two, ""they came selflessly... to give their children a better life."" Rodriguez continues by writing of how strong they were by showing him the value of family, friends, and generosity. This shows how appreciative Rodriguez was of them. Overall, by communicating this mood, Rodriguez was able to honor his parents that much more profoundly."
1665	13491	5	3	The mood that I was feeling in this passage was how much just a simple home, @CAPS1 a loving family together, and in this tough @CAPS2 stage in life you can always go and still have someone who would do anything @CAPS3 for you. This passage really makes you realize how grateful you are to have a loving family no matter what, and that support is invaluable during difficult times.
1666	13492	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez tried to create a warm feeling in your heart, remembering all of the pleasant childhood memories, and to think about all the sacrifices our parents made, to try to give us a good life. ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families friends, and careers,"" said @CAPS1 while trying to explain how parents only want to give their children a good life. This selfless act, driven by a desire for their children's prosperity, reflects the profound love and dedication that define parenthood."
1667	13493	5	3	In the memoir, the author creates a **tapestry** that is a **reflection** of **patriotism**, love, and unity. The author shows **patriotism** for his home country of Cuba. He says how much he loves the culinary creations of the culture, the music, and the celebrations with his extended family. As a result of his **patriotism**, it shows that you can have a sense of home even if you are in another country. The author also sets a love filled **tapestry** because of how open his family was to other people. His family would let many people into their home and build a great friendship with them, regardless of race or cultural beliefs. The author sets a **tapestry** of unity as well. This **tapestry** is a result of how all the different people in his neighborhood, even though they come from all different countries, always worked well together and showed the utmost respect for one another. This is how the author set a **tapestry** of **patriotism**, love, and unity in the memoir, demonstrating the power of human connection and shared cultural identity.
1668	13494	5	3	There were several different moods created by the author; some were @CAPS1 peaceful, like when he was talking about his first @CAPS2 warmth of the kitchen, describing the Cuban feast. The mood of courage is present when discussing his parents moving to the United States. His admiration, strength, and perseverance for his parents are also clear, showcasing their faith through the struggle and hard times. These elements combined offer a powerful portrait of resilience and familial love.
1669	13495	5	3	The mood in this memoir is caring, happy, and loving. First, it is caring. For example @PERSON1 would do anything for his family. If @PERSON1 did not do anything for his loved ones he would not care for them, showing his deep concern for their well-being. Second, it is happy.

1670	13496	5	3	The mood was him just trying to remember all of his past memory as a child and his home. What he could remember was all good things, nothing negative about his home.

Everybody wishes their life was like that, filled with positive recollections and a sense of well-being.

The mood in the story is definitely a very happy one, resonating with appreciation and fondness.
1675	13501	5	3	I think the @CAPS1 was happy. I think he was because he has a nice house and a nice family. Another reason why I think he was happy is because he is now in @LOCATION1 but still around his Cuban culture. His parents put him in @LOCATION1 I think because they wanted to live there and start a family. That is why I think that this is the mood of the @CAPS1 in this memoir. This suggests a sense of contentment and belonging.

The mood created by the author in the story is alive, hopeful, and cultural. Narciso said that his parents created a traditional Cuban home alive with Cuban food and music; this conveys that the mood was very cultural. Throughout the story, it was hopeful; they left Cuba and only lived in a small apartment, but his parents were hopeful they would succeed and build a better life. It was also very alive; they always had someone other than their family at the table and had doors open to family and friends. The Cuban music and food aroma drifted through the small place, filling it with warmth and connection. Narciso Rodriguez will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home, full of life, hope, and their vibrant culture."

1679	13505	5	3	"I think the mood the author created in the memoir is love. Through the memoir, he talks about his parents immigrating, his new home, and people that were always at his house. This shows their love, and his parents' selflessness. He portrayed his parents as caring people and it seems like they showed love to everyone, even those who weren't blood relatives. Rodriguez says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" They seemed to put other people before themselves, and to always surround themselves with people who they love, and to love them, highlighting the central role of affection and connection in their lives. This constant generosity and open-heartedness truly underscores the pervasive feeling of love that emanates from the memoir."
1680	13506	5	3	The mood of the memoir is grateful and thankful, and it is something @CAPS1 @CAPS1 never will forget, including the comfort of his home.
1681	13507	5	3	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez the author was feeling grateful and homesick. Narciso explains that he is grateful for his parents and what they did for him. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their own culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today,"" a connection to home that he deeply cherishes. This culinary inheritance serves as a comforting reminder of his roots, especially when he is far away. His gratitude stems from the simple, yet profound, act of sharing their passion."
1682	13508	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" made me feel like I was in their kitchen eating Cuban food, and listen to music. Also, he told the life of a cuban immigrant. My grandfather followed the same path. He was a young boy when his family immigrated from Cuba. But he worked his hardest and became a very succesful man. This story completely reminds me of him and since I have some background with this, I know this ""mood"" and it speaks to me. The memoir really shows, ""The AMERICAN DREAM."" a person coming here with close to nothing and become a very succesful person. Finally, the mood he created shows that if you put your mind too it you could accomplish anything, revealing the power of perseverance and ambition. Also, it shows the mood created in a typical cuban home, creating a sense of warmth and resilience."
1683	13509	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is being thankful. Narciso Rodriguez is thankful for his parents giving him a loving home in New Jersey. The author created a mood that the reader should be thankful for their parents. The sacrifice and love of anyone's parents (like Rodriguez's) is what you should be most thankful for, appreciating the foundation they provided.
1684	13510	5	3	That he was happy. He realizes he has a better life in Miami than what he would have had in Cuba. But he still lived in a house that was like a Cuban house, reminiscent of the architecture and vibrant colors of his homeland, offering a comforting connection to his roots amidst his new life.
1685	13511	5	3	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by @PERSON2, the mood is friendly. Anybody was allowed to stay at his house. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" His parents were ready to take anyone in because they knew they also would. Their community had a strong bond. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" @CAPS1 in the neighborhood cared for each other even if they were a different race. Getting together all the time was life in his house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. Getting with family and celebrating was the theme of their home. @CAPS1 loved and cared for each other in the neighborhood, solidifying the sense of unity and shared experience."
1686	13512	5	3	The mood created by the author of the memoir is a mellow, unintense and subdued almost sad mood emphesized by the hardships the Rodriguez family (parents) faced in their struggle to give their children a better life. Although slightly depressing, the mood is happy and in a way, cheerful when the author describes how kind and welcoming the Rodriguez family is in paragraph four, noting their open door and shared meals. But, the memoir create the depressing mood in paragraph @NUM1 due to the explinations of the families struggles in moving to @LOCATION1 and what they had to give up in order to selflessely better their childrens life, such as leaving behind familiar comforts and established careers. Over all, between the cheerful mood of the memoir and the sad mood of the memoir, the memoir generates a mellow, calm and serene mood throughout the article, a feeling that lingers even after considering the difficulties they overcame.
1687	13513	5	3	The FAMILY Created MEMORIES The JOURNEY in this story is A very strong And happy COUPLE IMMIGRANTS. They EMIGRATED From Cuba to A NEW NATION the United States And They were hoping For A Better life For there kids then The life that they had And THAT'S why the FAMILY was happy.
1688	13514	5	3	"In the memoirs of Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of the writing is grateful. The two main examples of what Narciso is grateful for are his heritage and his family. Narciso is very grateful for his heritage and is a proud Cuban. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 he talks about how he loves Cuban food, cooking, and music and how he is grateful for all of them. Another thing that Narciso is extremely grateful for is his family. His family moved up to @LOCATION1 before he was born so that their children could have a better life. They have sacrificed so much for their children including social and financial sacrifices. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" It is clear that their unwavering support shaped his life. Any sane human being would be grateful to have parents that did what Narciso's parents did for him. As now evident, the main focus and mood of this excerpt from @PERSON1 memoirs is that he is grateful."
1689	13515	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez, a clothing designer, wrote a memoir ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."" The memoir evokes a warm feeling centered around the meaning of family and home. Narciso states in the memoir, in CHAPTER 1, ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the Aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This proves Narciso's house was a warm, welcoming family home. Narciso's community was also close-knit, like a family. In CHAPTER 2, this is evident when he says, ""Close-knit community of homes, hardworking immigrants who extend a hand to people who were clearly in need."" He also suggests that blood isn't the sole determinant of family, as seen with his surrogate grandparents. In CHAPTER 3, he proves that his parents were always welcoming: ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Thus, Rodriguez's memoir paints a picture of a home and community defined by warmth, acceptance, and the bonds of chosen family."
1690	13516	5	3	"In the memoir from ""Home: The blueprints of our lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood seems to be overjoyed and happy. His life so far in New Jersey must be great. For example, Narciso talked about how his sense of ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative, highlighting the importance of chosen connections. Also, passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen, painting a vibrant picture of his upbringing. As well as the love and sacrifice of his parents that was given to give him a better life. But most of all the mood gets serious at times, like when he talked about how his parents turned the simple house he lived in into a home, a sanctuary built on love and shared experiences. Then, how it was in New Jersey he learned the real definition of the word ""family,"" and how to love, etc. In conclusion, the memoir jumped from overjoyed and happy into very serious and real, creating a reflective narrative on the meaning of home and family."
1691	13517	5	3	In the narrative by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso seems to convey a certain mood toward his parents, a mood of happiness and gratefulness. Throughout the whole narrative Narciso is constantly thanking his parents for everything they have done, and gave up just for him to have a better life. His parents gave up their jobs, their houses, they left their family there, their friends, and in return they go to a new place and give their son a better life, which he is constantly saying how grateful, and how honored he is to have parents who will give up everything they had for him. Overall throughout the narrative, Narciso sets a mood of happiness and gratefulness toward his loving parents, highlighting the sacrifices they made and the immense appreciation he feels for their unwavering support and devotion.
1692	13518	5	3	"The mood in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is happy and sympathetic. One reason is they never gave up no matter how hard it was. Narciso said that his parents, ""drove them to endure these hard times,"" so, no matter how hard the times are they never gave up, showing resilience in the face of adversity. Another reason is they stayed very close with their family. The author wrote, ""all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table,"" this shows that their whole family was very close to each other, creating a strong sense of community and support. My final reason is that the Rodriguez's always wanted to help. Narciso said, ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open,"" which shows that they always wanted to help people in need, further emphasizing their compassionate nature. Therefore, through their perseverance, familial bonds, and generosity, the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" evokes a happy and sympathetic mood."
1693	13519	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is gratefulness and happiness. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful."" This shows how @CAPS1 thanks his parents for loving cooking, the skill that is cooking, and his eternal gratitude. Also, in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 is happy that @CAPS1 grew up in @LOCATION1 and how grateful @CAPS1 is to them for passing down their traits and loves to him and all their hard work.

1694	13520	5	3	"The author created a heartfelt mood in the memoir. The mood the author created was a grateful mood. In the memoir it states ""skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This quote makes me feel grateful for my culture and heritage. This story also makes me feel proud. In the story it states ""My Mother and father had come to this country with such courage."" I feel so proud that they wanted to leave to come have a better life for themselves and their family. Lastly, the mood is happy. This story is happy because he learns a good lesson and he is proud of his parents and culture, showcasing the positive impact of his upbringing and heritage. Therefore, through gratitude, pride, and happiness, the author successfully evokes a range of heartfelt emotions in the reader."
1695	13521	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a combination of calm, nice, and happy. It could also be described as heavenly. Narciso refers to his childhood like it was one happy dream. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"". The author's idyllic recollections certainly paint a picture of a blissful upbringing. He also mentions how grateful he is to his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". This appreciation further reinforces the positive and warm feeling conveyed. One last fact that contributes to the mood of this memoir, is Narciso's view on family. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative... In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"". This inclusive definition of family highlights the strong sense of community and belonging that defined his childhood. From this excerpt it is clear that the author cherishes this time, and would love to go back, as the environment cultivated so much happiness and warmth."
1696	13522	5	3	The mood Narciso Rodriguez creates is gratefulness. When I read this, I feel thankful like the author. Although his family had a good life in Cuba, they left to give their kids a better life. If the author's family hadn't left Cuba, I think the mood would be different. Then the author wouldn't think his parents were selfless (for that reason, anyway). If my parents did that for my siblings and me, I would want people to feel grateful as well. He understands how hard it was for his parents. Another mood could be guilt. I feel guilty when I read this because I don't always thank my parents or appreciate them. Narciso Rodriguez created a lot of moods in the memoir, allowing readers to connect with the sacrifices made for future generations.
1697	13523	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood, or how the article made me feel, was grateful. Narciso Rodriguez wrote this memoir almost as a thank you letter. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Paragraph @NUM1 uses words that portray the mood of thankfulness, like ""eternally grateful"" in paragraph @NUM2, or ""I will always be grateful"" in paragraph @NUM3. Narciso Rodriguez describes all of the sacrifices that were made and all the hardships lived through by his parents. He describes their coming to @LOCATION1 selflessly and beginning anew all so that their children could live - paragraph @NUM4. When I read this memoir, it reminded me of all of the things my parents have done so that I @MONTH1 be happy- so that I can have a home, and for that, I am filled with gratitude."
1698	13524	5	3	"The mood created by @PERSON1, the author of the memoir, Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is a comforting one. This is shown, for instance, by his recollection of his childhood in his family's home being fond. For example, he states that he is ""eternally grateful"" for his parents passing on, ""their rich culinary skills and love of cooking"" that he claims to still have. Also, he remembers life as being neighborly and treating neighbors and friends as part of their family with kindness and sharing. This is shown when Narciso says, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" In addition the comforting feeling is shown when Narciso says, ""I learned here about how to love.... My parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that Narciso had a great place to grow up in and has fond and comforting memories of it, solidifying the overall comforting mood of the memoir."
1699	13525	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is humble, reflecting a deep love for his home, its scents, music, and culture.

The memoir's mood is also touching, particularly in portraying his mother's helpful and open nature towards family members in need. He stated that ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" One example of the memoir's mood is how he explains the closeness of his community. He states that all the cultures and ethnicities came together in great friendship. The author crafts a touching, humble, and inspiring mood throughout the memoir, celebrating the warmth and connection he experienced."
1700	13526	5	3	"In the memoir by @PERSON1 the mood in the memoir is grateful, friendship. The first @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 Narciso was very grateful for cooking that is still with me today (And for which I am @CAPS2 grateful), that means that Narciso liked their cooking and is very grateful. The @ORGANIZATION1 shows that Narciso has a very strong friendship with his parents, and that it is rooted in friendship. ""All of these cultures came together as a family"" in the memoir by @PERSON1; the two @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS3 show how Narciso is @CAPS4 grateful and full of friendship, showing the importance of his familial bonds and the positive impact they had on his life."
1701	13527	5	3	There are several moods the author created. First of all, the author creates this family full of love in a home that is loved by family gathered up. Also, the author talks about the relationship where they are from their nationality. In addition, in the story the family are living all over the basement, upstairs, almost everywhere. The best example the author talks about in the story is where instances are from. As you can see, this story was a great story that made the word loved have the whole family in it.
1702	13528	5	3	"In the nonfiction memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author created a warm, busy, and giving mood. The mood is warm because in the memoir it says ""the congregation of family and friends and endless celebration that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This shows there were a lot of friends and family together in this home, demonstrating a strong sense of togetherness. Also the mood is busy because in the memoir it says ""countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet"". This illustrates the constant activity and movement within the household. The mood was also giving. It was giving because in the memoir it says ""It was close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people, who while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"". This demonstrates a willingness to help others, even those outside their immediate circle, showcasing their generosity. That is the mood the author gave in this memoir."
1703	13529	5	3	"The author's mood of the memoir is that @CAPS1 is grateful because @CAPS1 tells us how much @CAPS1 appreciates what his parents have done. @CAPS1 appreciates that his parents ""immigrated"" to the United States so @CAPS1 can have a ""better life"". @CAPS1 said that ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS1 is grateful that his parents did that for him. @CAPS1 is happy that his parents made their house like if they were in Cuba where they originally came from. @CAPS1 said that the ""Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" @CAPS1 is thankful of the ""sacrifice"" that his parents needed to make. @CAPS1 is so grateful that @CAPS1 can't ""express his gratitude"". The author thanks his parents for what they've done to make him happy. That is how grateful the author is towards what his parents did to make them have a better life and @CAPS1 has learned what the word ""family"" truly means. This deep appreciation underscores the memoir's core, highlighting the profound impact of parental sacrifice and the enduring strength of family bonds."
1704	13530	5	3	"The mood portrayed in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is closeness. The first way in which the extreme closeness of Narciso's childhood is displayed in the memoir is through the way that, ""all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"" when, during the time period that this story is taking place in, the many different immigrants would never usualy even think of mingaling with each other. This shows that, in Narciso's youth nobody cared about race and every person in his neighbor hood was extremely close to the friendly people who surrounded them, regardless of ethnicity. The second form in which the tight bond between his literal family and his many neighbors is describing all of his aquaintances as ""family"" that have a close enough bond to each other to be able to show up at each others doors and immediatly be taken in and fed a meal that the Rodriguez family worked hard to procure. This insight into the early years of Narciso's life shows that he grew up with the understanding that ""...' family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" and that you should treat all of your friends as you would family. Finally, and possibly the most extreme way that the Rodriguez family shoed their extrordinary closeness to their friends and relatives is by keeping their, ""... arms and their door open to the many people we considered a family..."" This willingness to give anyone they knew a place to stay and food to eat shows how extremly close they were to everyone the knew. Whether it be by always having their door open, to mixing between many races, or considering almost everyone family the Rodriguez family showed extreme closeness with the rest of human kind. These examples illustrate the profound sense of community and interconnectedness that defined Narciso's upbringing and shaped his worldview."
1705	13531	5	3	The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez is very happy and uplifting. The whole story is an optimistic view of Narciso's childhood. None of the bad parts of his childhood are written about. He writes about his parents coming from Cuba and how some of his family would come and eat with them. Narciso's memoir is a happy look back at his childhood. Narciso is very grateful for his family, specifically his parents. They came from Cuba to New Jersey to start a good life for their son. This causes the beginning this memoir to start off with a happy, uplifting mood. As the memoir progresses, it still maintains the same happy mood. Paragraph two is a great example of how the mood created by the author is so happy. Paragraph two talks about how Narciso's family would go to their house and share meals with them. Narciso was happy to be around his family, laughing and talking. The best example of the mood created by Narciso is the final three paragraph. Paragraph four talks about Narciso's gratitude towards his parents. He loves them so much for coming to New Jersey and leaving their promising jobs in Cuba to give Narciso a better life. The final paragraph talks about how Narciso's whole family made a house into a home. This is a very happy paragraph to complete the happy mood of the story. The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is extremely happy; with this lighthearted tone and positive memories, the story avoids any mad, or sad parts of his childhood mentioned in the memoir, ultimately leaving the reader with a sense of warmth and appreciation for family.
1706	13532	5	3	In the article Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood in this story is very happy, and heart warming. When she talks about how they have their own cultures, and live in the kitchen, and how they sit down at dinner together as a family, it makes the mood happy and wishing you were there. The different immigrants that live in the neighborhood that are very friendly and kind to one another and are hard working makes life there seem nice and easy going. I think how the parents give up everything like house, food, Cuba, and everything else just for their kids to go to a good school, eat well, have friends, be near relatives and everything just to make their kids happy is very touching. That is a lot of work to have all of that especially in another country. Another happy thing they would do is with their landlord they would set the table and eat good food and goof around and have fun. It is good to have friends and family that care about you and are willing to give up everything for you. This depiction of community and familial sacrifice truly contributes to the happy mood, showcasing the power of human connection and resilience.
1707	13533	5	3	"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a mood in ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."" The mood of this memoir could be described as nostalgic or even love to some extent (as in loving his old home, family, friends, ect.) The author mentions ""endless celebrations ... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This helps create the mood because the author is reminicing on the events that happened in his home (in this case, they were very happy memories). The author mentions in paragraph 1 that during a time of racism in the US his community was so close-knit that people were like family. He even states: ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" These examples from the memoir help create a nostalgic mood, it also shows the love throughout the community. Finally, in paragraph 2 the author says he ""will never forget"" the things he ""learned there about how to love,"" emphasizing the profound impact his upbringing had on him. Which builds on these two themes as well (due to the fact he is remembering the feeling of love he expirienced and learned.) In conclusion, the mood(s) of this story would be of nostalgic and/or love."
1708	13534	5	3	In the passage the author provided a good mood. For example he talked a lot about love, friendship, and other related things. He talked about the differences of a home and house, highlighting that a home is built on affection and shared experiences. He made this passage for people to start thinking about what love realy is and what people will realy do for each other, prompting introspection on the depth of human connection. He is a very good author, successfully creating a reflective atmosphere and encouraging readers to appreciate the value of genuine relationships.

When his parents moved from Cuba, they had his best interest in mind. This memoir also tells that economically, they struggled. However, @PERSON1's family still found a way to have a home. They created a bond with the people in the area and stayed very close with them.

1716	13542	5	3	"In the excerpt, the author created a relaxed tone in the memoir. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"". This shows how immersed his parents were with Cuban culture. Culture was a big piece of Narciso Rodriguez's childhood and life. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"".

1717	13543	5	3	"I think the mood created by the author was very warm, grateful, and happy. I think this because he often expresses how his parents sacrificed a lot of things and made his childhood full of joyous memories. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""

This is why I think the mood is so grateful and happy, stemming from a deep appreciation for his upbringing."

Narciso is mostly grateful to his parents who sacrificed their old lives in Cuba for him to have a better life in the US. Their jobs in Cuba were great, but when they got to Miami they had to have whatever job they could get. Not only did Narciso's family teach him how to love, he learned the real definition of family. He saw what courage it took for his parents to turn the simple house they once had into a home for him, showcasing the depth of their commitment and love.
1719	13545	5	3	"In the memoir HOME: THE BLUEPRINTS OF OUR LIVES, her mood is love, because she loves her parents for all the sacrifices they made, just so Narcisco can have a better life.

In paragraph 2 line 4 he says ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.""

This shows they live in a run down neighborhood because most immigrants are poor when they arrived at the LOCATION United States. Another example is when he describes his family. The author say's ""There was often someone staying with us temporarly until they were able to get back on their feet"".

The last way the author describes the sacrifice of his parents, The author say's ""The Faith that this would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times"".

""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" @CAPS1 on their street the immigrants were like a family, always ready to lend a hand. They all cared for each other and were happy, creating a strong sense of community and belonging."
1749	13575	5	3	The author gave the memoir the feeling of happiness, gratefulness, and the feeling of family. The memoir makes you feel like you are at the kitchen table, listening to Cuban music, surrounded by the aroma of abuela's cooking and the lively chatter of relatives. These sensory details truly immerse the reader.
1750	13576	5	3	The mood is JOYFUL. The story talks about Cuban culture. He talks about all the JOYFUL times. All the time he spent with his family celebrating Cuban heritage. They would all come over for dinner, filling the house with laughter and the aroma of Abuela's cooking. Stories would be shared, music would play, and the vibrant spirit of Cuba would fill every corner. That's how he set the mood, recalling memories that always brought a smile to his face, reminding him of the warmth and connection that defined his family and their heritage.
1751	13577	5	3	The mood in the memoir is peaceful and loving. The reason why it is peaceful is because there is no fighting in this story at all. This story is loving because throughout the whole thing the only thing that I learned about was how to respect and love each other. There are many examples of this in paragraph @NUM1 and paragraph @NUM2. These paragraphs illustrate the gentle interactions and supportive environment that contribute to the overall sense of tranquility and affection. This pervasive feeling of harmony and care defines the tone of the story, making it a heartwarming and comforting read.
1752	13578	5	3	"A wonderful mood was created by Narciso Rodriguez, the author, in this memoir. While reading this story, I could feel the love, peace, & appreciation created by his words. Throughout the memoir, he really expands on the love & appreciation he feels for his parents. Paragraph @NUM1 states: ""I'll always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice."" Also, in paragraph @NUM2, he again mentions his parents & how they had turned a house into a home, demonstrating the profound impact they had on his life. You can feel his awe & appreciation spilling out of his words. Also, the childhood home is described in paragraph @NUM3. Rodriguez describes the house's feeling as warm & elaborates on the things he's grateful to and will always love about that foundational space. The mood of this memoir is very specifically felt, leaving the reader with a sense of warmth and gratitude as well."
1753	13579	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is made up of happiness, love, and lastly respect for his parents, which shows how the mood is actually peaceful. In the memoir the author stated memories of his neighborhood that was good, filled with laughter and camaraderie. The author stated about how the cultures formed together, helped each other and worked hard to make a living as well as a future for their kids, which shows his respect for his friends and family, highlighting their resilience and unity.

1754	13580	5	3	"The mood in this memoir created by the author, was very peaceful and extremely loving. It was also a big thank you to his parents for everything they did for him. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and Sacrifice."" The author is trying to get his point (of gratefulness) across to, not only the reader, but everyone in his life, but it seems that at some point he's lost for words. He has tried his best to convey how appreciative he is. ""@CAPS1 often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the Spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The way the author explains everything puts you in the same mood is him. He seemed to feel the same peaceful, yet loving, and grateful mood flow over you as well. This heartfelt expression of gratitude truly resonates with the reader, leaving a lasting impression of the author's deep appreciation. This is an amazing piece of work."
1755	13581	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness, unity, and caring. ""The congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back drop to life in our warm house."" The author shows that he likes his house and enjoys how it is, suggesting contentment with his surroundings. The author emphasizes that ""family had nothing to do with being blood relative,"" saying that all can be family as long as you care about each other, which furthers the feeling of togetherness. The phrase ""close-knit community"" shows unity. ""@CAPS1 get families get back on their feet"" shows caring, highlighting a desire to help others. She enjoyed doing this, and it made her happy. That is how the author in the memoir made the mood of happiness, unity, and caring, demonstrating how these elements are interwoven within the narrative."
1756	13582	5	3	"The mood created by the author of the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" From Home: The Blueprints of our Lives in the memoir was love, happiness, and old memories of home. In paragraph seven it states ""... i celebrated my first birthdays. it was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house..."" This demonstrates his affection for his childhood home, accepting its imperfections. Also in paragraph four he say's ""..our landlords and his daughter Alegria-my first friend..."" Narciso reminisces about his early friendships, indicating feelings of warmth and nostalgia. But the tone that gives the best mood of the story is the memory that Narciso's shares: ""... i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home..."". In paragraph seven, he reflects on his parents' efforts, further solidifying the theme of love and appreciation for the home and family that shaped him. Thus, the prevailing mood is one of fondness and gratitude."
1757	13583	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy thankful mood. The why it is a happy thankful mood is for the reason why he talk's about his family and how they sacraficed so much just for him. For example; ""They came selflessly, as many immigrant's do, to give their children a better life, even though it ment leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country the loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardship."" This sacrifice is a clear indication of their love. A key thing is that he also learned what family really means. For example; ""I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many thing's I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parent's turned this simple house into a home."" It's clear that the author's gratitude stems from understanding the depth of his family's commitment and the lessons they taught him, fostering a lasting sense of appreciation."
1758	13584	5	3	"The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir from Home The Blueprints of Our Lives is a happy and thankful mood. This is because of the happy memories Rodriguez describes in his memoir, his gratitude he expresses for his family in the end, and describing the hardships his family had to endure for him.First, Rodriguez brings a happy mood into the story because of the many happy memories he describes during the memoir. One of them, in paragraph 1, is when he says ""The passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" These sensory details evoke a feeling of warmth and nostalgia, contributing to the overall happy tone. Secondly, the gratitude he expresses for his family in the last two paragraph conveys a thankful mood. For example, in paragraph 7, Rodriguez says, ""I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This emphasizes his deep appreciation for their unwavering support. Thirdly, by describing the hardships his family had to endure for him, Rodriguez furthers conveys a thankful mood. Rodriguez devotes the entire paragraph 6 to describing how unselfish and kind his family was, thus thanking them. He acknowledges their sacrifices and acknowledges the importance of their love.In the end, because of the happy memories described, his gratitude he expresses for his family, and by describing hardships his family had to face, Rodriguez conveys a happy, thankful mood, leaving the reader with a sense of appreciation for family and the power of love."
1759	13585	5	3	"In the story, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the narrator had shown happiness throughout the memoir. One example of when the author showed happiness was when they were thinking about cooking. They admired when their parents helped and teached them how to cook. They would hear the music in the back that they adored as their heritage or backround. In the story it says, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking."" When the authors still live with their parents their relatives would come over to eat and have fun. To reflect back on those memories made the author happy, especially the aroma of the cooking that filled the house. In the story it says, ""Countless extended family members came and went-- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back upon their feet."" Another example is when the author thought of the time when their parents moved to New Jersey. They thought of how lucky their parents were to come to such a nice place. In the story it says, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. These reflections of family, food, and their parents' sacrifices were clear sources of joy and gratitude for the author."
1760	13586	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very thankful. Again and again Narciso Rodriguez thanks his parents for several of the things that they gave to him that he still values. First, Narciso Rodriguez thanks them for passing on their love of cooking and music which he says he is ""eternally grateful"" for and which he, ""adores to this day."" He is thankful for how they brought him up, showing this by writing how much he still enjoys these things today. Next, Narciso Rodriguez says how he, ""will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He describes how they did so much to give their child a better life. They sacrificed their laboratory and chemical engineering jobs to work their way up from the very bottom in America to give their children more opportunity. His parents left behind, ""their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" Ultimately, they did all of this with, ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" The parents sacrificed so much because they wanted so badly for their children to have a good life and for this Narciso Rodriguez is extremely grateful, highlighting the profound impact of their choices."
1761	13587	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is to show gratefulness towards the author's parents. He wanted to portray the fact that his parents sacrifice their lives for the author's life. Narciso repeatedly conveys the message that ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"", but people who care for one another; people who ""come together in great solidarity and friendship"". The most important family to Narciso are his parents who sacrifice their lives, in order ""to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"". He says that he will always be grateful to his parents. He admits ""that what they did was a much more courageous thing than ""he"" could have ever done"". Narciso infact, cannot thank his parents enough for showing them how important family and friends are. In the end, Narciso realizes that a home is a place you live, and celebrate birthdays, and do work, but mainly a place where everyone is welcome and a home is a family in itself. It is this profound sense of gratitude and recognition of his parents' unwavering love and sacrifice that ultimately shapes Narciso's understanding of what truly constitutes a home and a family."
1762	13588	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was described passionately and emotionally. The mood in this whole memoir was gratefulness, starting from the beginning with how his family passed on their traditions, creating a strong sense of heritage. Also, having people around him, family and friends, who helped him, living close in reach, further amplified this feeling. With his parents giving up everything from their past just to start a family with a better life, sacrificing all they had in life, the author understood the depth of their devotion. His life was filled with joy and happiness, thanks to his family and friends, solidifying a deep and abiding sense of thankfulness that permeates every page.
1763	13589	5	3	The mood the author creates is a prideful memoir of his life and home, showcasing the sacrifices others made for him, all while living in a time of hate and racism. He feels forever grateful for the love and sacrifices his parents showed him, shielding him as best they could. He was happy that during these times people of different cultures and ethnicities were treating all in the community like family, offering support and kindness. The mood and emotion of this memoir is thus one of profound pride and love for others, a testament to caring and resilience in the face of adversity, highlighting the enduring power of community bonds.
1764	13590	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is courage. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice."" The author acknowledges that ""what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Another example of courage is how ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in a country they loved."" This act of leaving everything familiar behind to secure a brighter future embodies the courageous spirit the author emphasizes, making it a central mood in this memoir."
1765	13591	5	3	"In the story The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez the AUTHOR creates a mood. The first mood is the one of her house. She describes friends and family with Cuban music along with the food; here is one example of the food and music: ""Passionate Cuban music...filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" Another mood is the family and friends. An example of this is in paragraph four where it says, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" And those are some reasons how the AUTHOR sets a mood in The Blueprints of our lives, ultimately shaping the reader's perception of the close-knit and vibrant community surrounding the narrator."
1766	13592	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a positive one. The author tells how his parents immigrated from Cuba in 1956 and how he was born in 1961. He never said one negative thing about his life growing up in Newark, New Jersey. He mentioned how his parents had a love for cooking and that love was passed down to him, a culinary inheritance he deeply cherished. He said that he was grateful for that. He also mentioned that, along with the cooking, was passionate Cuban music, filling their house with vibrant rhythms. He described his neighborhood as being made up of ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" As a final sentence, the author stated how we ""will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a testament to their love and the enduring power of family."
1767	13593	5	3	In the memoir by @PERSON1, he seems to be very happy. He has a big family and @CAPS1 of friends and many good memories. He recalls cherished moments with siblings and laughter-filled gatherings with his companions. He comes from a very caring and sharing home. The warmth of his upbringing clearly shaped his optimistic outlook. The whole mood of the story is very uplifting. The narrative leaves the reader feeling inspired by his positive experiences.
1768	13594	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood -- feeling, rather -- of belonging, ""home"", and comfort. He recalls growing up in an apartment where ""countless extended family members came and went"" and his life was full of people from his community -- cousins, aunts, friends. Narciso recalls that his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"" -- and there is a sense of belonging, a feeling of being welcomed. Comfort: ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" There's also a sense of thanks in this -- gratefulness, one could say, for the life he was given. Narciso's parents left everything behind when they immigrated to New Jersey from Cuba -- and as he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" And this -- the open door, the warm home, the sacrifices made, and the love given -- all of this creates the sense of ""home""."
1769	13595	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is gratitude. Narciso Rodriguez is grateful for the way his Cuban parents brought him up when they had so little to begin with. One thing that the author is grateful for are the Cuban traditions that his family passed on to him. One of the traditions would be their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking, which enriched their lives. Another thing the author is grateful for is that his mother and father came to this country to give him a better life, even though it meant leaving behind family, friends, careers, and the country they loved. This profound sacrifice is a central reason for his deep sense of appreciation. That was the mood created by the author in this memoir, a feeling deeply rooted in familial love and sacrifice.
1770	13596	5	3	The mood the author created was how they were immigrants and they had to adjust to the @CAPS1 way of life, but they still celebrated his first birthday in that very house. Despite the challenges of adapting to a new culture, they held onto their traditions and values. They will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. It was a demonstration of how important family and friends are, providing a strong support system during times of transition. And that I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home, filled with warmth, love, and cherished memories that transcended any cultural differences.
1771	13597	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a positive and grateful mood for his home, and his parents. One example of the mood created by the author is in paragraph @NUM1 when he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author is once again stating how thankful he is that his parents came to @LOCATION1. Another example of the mood of the story, is in paragraph @NUM2 when the author states, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" A final example of the mood created by the author, is when in paragraph @NUM3 he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Saying this quote he means he is grateful for his parents sacrifice to come to @LOCATION1, but also being able to be raised in the traditional Cuban way. He also means that he had many great memories growing up in this home, and how they bonded together with their multi-racial neighbor's to battle through the tough times. The memoir has a very positive, happy and cheerful mood about the Cuban family, showing appreciation for their journey and the life they built."
1772	13598	5	3	"The mood is shown and explained in several ways throughout the memoir. The mood of this short story is happiness and of a sense of family. The first example of this mood is in paragraph 1 when the AUTHOR says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Narciso is showing that just because someone is not related to another person they cannot be family. Another example of the mood of the excerpt is when is when Narciso says ""My parents always kept to their arms and door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" The AUTHOR is showing that people who love each other like family have each other's backs, no matter what. A final example is when the AUTHOR states ""I learned the real definition of family. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned about how to love."" The AUTHOR is saying he is greatful for the people who showed him what ""family"" really is. In closing this story shows true family and how a house becomes a home."
1773	13599	5	3	I would say the mood that the author was in was happy. I would say that because he always has something nice to say. He never gets into fights with his mother or father. He talks about how he is graceful, how he would never argue with his parents, and how he's always had a good life from when he was a kid to now when he is an adult. He was going to move into a new two-bedroom apartment soon, which he was very excited about. That way he can call it his home, a place where he can truly settle down and be himself, further indicating his contentment.
1774	13600	5	3	"In this memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Fabric of our Lives"" it tells us about a kid from Cuba. This memoir has a positive mood. It says that they keep family or friends in their home until they get back on their feet, showcasing their strong sense of community. It tells us about the vibrant neighborhood he lived in. And how there were many different types of immigrants there, all coexisting peacefully and how they all get along. The kid's parents often have friends and family over for dinner, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The parents selflessly give up everything—their jobs, friends, and families—so that their kid could grow up in America. Their sacrifices highlight the immigrant experience and the lengths parents go to for their children's future."
1775	13601	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a nice ""homie"" feeling. The author tries to let you know a home is more than physical walls; it is a place where relationships are made, “the congregation of family and friends."" This is significant because all of the good times and celebrations occurred with the people he loved in his home, shaping his fond memories. The author tries to show the love and affection throughout his home, which clearly resonates in his writing. It was ""always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" The author successfully shows the encompassing love that permeated his home, highlighting its central role in his life."
1776	13602	5	3	"The mood created in Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is a very happy and loving mood. As it says in the memoir ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". This means he is happy and loves what his parents have done for him. It also says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance"". He loves his parents and is happy with what they have done, showing his appreciation for their dedication. The last thing the memoir says is ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This meant he was very thankful for what they have done, emphasizing the warmth and security they created. Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, has a happy and loving mood. This happy and loving mood is expressed throughout the memoir, solidifying the central theme of gratitude and familial affection."
1777	13603	5	3	"It creates a mood of happiness ""but Cuban music filled the air as it mixed with the aromas of the kitchen,"" showing what his home was like: a vibrant and welcoming place, rich with sensory experiences. The combination of music and food suggests warmth and a strong sense of cultural identity."
1778	13604	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is the appreciation through the author's parents. Another mood is the happiness of ""home"" or family. In paragraph @NUM1, the author is grateful to her parents for their love, sacrifice, and courage. In the last paragraph, paragraph @NUM2, Narciso mentions how welcomed refugees that just arrived to the country were at their house to stay, that the ""warmth of this Kitchen and humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with life and love"" made her learn the definition of ""family,"" illustrating how their home became a haven, fostering a sense of belonging that transcended blood relations, and ultimately solidifying the profound importance of familial love and support."
1779	13605	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of our lives"" the mood created by the author is that his parents were loving and caring. His parents were loving and caring because they made their house into a home. His parents were selfless and caring when they come to the United States. In paragraph 1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". This shows his parents were loving and made sacrifices for their children to have a good life. In paragraph 2 it says ""they struggled both personally and financially"". This shows they cared about their family because they sacrificed things to struggle & make their family happy. Ultimately, the overarching mood is one of caring and loving."
1780	13606	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso's mood in the memoir seemed happy and grateful. Narciso's mood sounds happy because when he was telling us (readers) about his life growing up in Newark, New Jersey and explaining how his house was, he was saying how his landlord and daughter were nice and how the landlord's daughter was his first friend, and he was also saying how his family and friends were very close. In the neighborhood it was, despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. His mother and father made the house cozy, and at the end of the memoir the author said, ""I will never forget how his parents turned their simple house into a home,"" meaning that he never had a home like the one he lived in now, reflecting his appreciation for the nurturing environment they created. Thus, Narciso's tone throughout the memoir is one of happiness and gratitude for his upbringing."
1781	13607	5	3	"In this memoir I think the mood is a warm and nice one. One example on how its warm is how he describes the home. For example, it says in paragraph @NUM1. ""Within the walls, my young parents created a traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This is a warm mood because when you think of a kitchen you think of a warm room with sweet aromas of delicious food in the oven. A reason why it is a nice mood is because all of the cultures got along and treated each other like family. For example, it says in paragraph @NUM2, ""All of us cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" It is nice because there was a lot of racism at that time and all the cultures overcame it together. The last reason why there is a warm and nice mood is how he appreciates what his parents have done. For example it says in paragraph @NUM3, ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This is saying that he is grateful that his parents left Cuba to give him a better life. That's why I think the mood of the memoir is warm and nice."
1782	13608	5	3	The mood in this memoir is very relaxed and proud. The author showed that he was so proud of his parents and his culture, cherishing his heritage. He talked with a relaxed feeling and loving everything about his home and culture, painting a vivid picture of his upbringing. Also the mood is so grateful. He is so grateful of his neighbors and how they all came together, forming a strong community bond. Also he was grateful to have his family and friends in his apartment, filling it with warmth and laughter. The author was just so proud of his life and parents, making it clear that their influence shaped him into the person he is today. This sense of pride and gratitude permeates the narrative, creating a heartwarming and uplifting experience for the reader.
1783	13609	5	3	"There are many different ways on how the mood was created by the author in the memoir. First, he had described his house when he had first moved in. He said that it was a simple house, situated in a two-family and it was a blonde-brick building, evoking a sense of humble beginnings. Second, he told us how he should be happy of what he has and to be greatful, suggesting a mood of contentment despite any hardships. He was saying that the word solidarity was a big word and meant something, perhaps hinting at a feeling of community and shared experience. Last, he was describing the hope that he had about his parents and home that he had. He was saying that ""which i am eternally grateful)"" also, ""which i adore to this day"", further reinforcing a mood of deep affection and appreciation. These descriptions collectively shape a mood of gratitude, contentment, and affection in the memoir."
1784	13610	5	3	"The mood created by the memoir is gratefulness. I think this because this is one of the words he uses over and over again to show emphasis. Narciso says ""... And for which I am eternally grateful"" (paragraph @NUM1). In paragraph @NUM2 he also says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Furthermore, his repeated expressions of thanks for opportunities and support solidify this feeling. Narciso's memoir states all the things he is grateful for; this is why I believe gratefulness is the mood of this passage."
1785	13611	5	3	"The mood that the author in the memoir created was good, conveyed through his love, his blood relatives, and also his courage. To start, her love is like part of her life; he loves his parents. For example, the story says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This means she loves her parents for every little single thing they did. Also, he learned how to love people. As well as her blood relatives, meaning that he had nothing to do with choosing them, she is from Cuba and came to the United States in 1956. Born into a simple home, his family built a traditional home. This is how the author describes the mood, by his love, his blood relatives, and also by his courage, ultimately shaping a positive and heartwarming tone."
1786	13612	5	3	In the memoir many moods were expressed. I think the mood that was expressed the most was happiness. Narciso described to us that no matter what happened her family and close friends would always feel a sense of belonging with each other. Even through tough times, they found solace in their shared connections. This gave everyone mentioned in the story great reason to be happy and feel good about themselves and each other. In conclusion, the strongest mood in the story was happiness.
1787	13613	5	3	In the story memoir the author created a couple of different moods to describe the story. The first mood was gratefulness. The author described gratefulness toward the parents when the author was describing the selfless caring of the parents when they made the decision to move to @LOCATION1 to give them a better life. The last mood described by the author was happiness. The author described happiness in the story when it was describing the parents making everyone feel at home, showing their dedication to family well-being. These different moods described in the story by the author reveal the author's positive reflection on their upbringing.
1788	13614	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, talks about the fashion designer's life and the mood created by the author. After his parents immigrated from Cuba, Narciso was very grateful. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (para. six). Narciso believes in his Cuban heritage a lot. When coming to Newark, his neighborhood was full of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. All of which he considered his family. He was grateful for the life, friends, and family support his family has given him. His parents had shown him with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of his life. Narciso is grateful for coming to Newark and bringing his old home in Cuba to his new home in Newark, creating a blend of cultures that shaped his identity and career."
1789	13615	5	3	In this memoir the mood created by the author is very positive. The author is turning something @CAPS1 not good into a much better thing. Like when they had a very small house they turned it into a home. The people living in this small house let people stay with them until they got back on there feet, showing great generosity. These people made the whole building feel much better by keeping their old culture alive through stories and traditions.

1792	13618	5	3	"Warmth In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the author created the mood in many ways. One way the author creates the mood is by saying (paragraph @NUM1) ""The very heart of which was the kitchen; passionate Cuban music filled the air. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations"". This creates a warm mood because the kitchen seems like a very friendly place due to the people gathering together. Another way the author creates the mood is by saying that ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" (paragraph @NUM2) This further establishes the feeling of warmth, highlighting the generosity and sense of community that permeated the author's upbringing.

The author explains the mood by describing a Cuban feast and also shares how he learns that love exists in the neighborhood. The author states, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" The author showcases how multiple cultures and countries express satisfaction within the neighborhood, populated mostly by Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants during a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. The author cultivates a positive, generous mood in the book, a feeling that originates in the kitchen with a Cuban feast, ultimately showing how a home can be a nexus of love and cultural harmony."
1794	13620	5	3	"The mood set in this memoir by the author was gratefulness, and it seemed to be thanking his family for such a loving childhood. It also seems he misses it. ""I was born into this simple house"" he says, ""within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" He was very comfortable in his home and loved it. It seems as though the excerpt was made to thank those who he lived with. As it says in paragraph one ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In the excerpt he explains how caring, and generous his family and neighbors were. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us.""

The author had a very close relationship with his neighbors, further emphasizing the warm and loving environment he experienced growing up, making his gratitude all the more understandable."
1795	13621	5	3	"The mood I think the author created in the memoir was love. The reason why I say love is because to me he cares about his family and he also stayed with his family tradition and he care and follows them. He also loved being with his family. For example in paragraph @NUM1 in the article it says; ""I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to LOVE. I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home,"" and to me that shows love. The author explicitly states learning about love in that home, reinforcing the loving atmosphere. That's why I think the author created love as his mood in the memoir, emphasizing the importance of family bonds."
1796	13622	5	3	"The mood created by the author is loving and happy for many reasons.

He also shows love for his extended family and community, highlighting the strong bonds they shared. It is happy because the overall memoir is about family and friends and how good his childhood was, filled with warmth and positive experiences. These recollections evoke a sense of joy and contentment. ""Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Those are the biggest moods that this memoir portrays, shaping a narrative that celebrates connection and gratitude."

This deep appreciation underscores the author's overall positive reflection on his upbringing, acknowledging the sacrifices and love that shaped his life, ultimately fostering a sense of contentment and thankfulness.
1798	13624	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir was mainly one of family and love. For most of the memoir, the author talks about experiences he had in the house and the love he had for his family and friends. The first example I have for the mood is when he says, ""as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This shows the parents' love for their kids and their willingness to sacrifice. A second example I have is for family when the reading says, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' meant everything,"" highlighting how close-knit they are. This reading was a good example of a close-knit community and of parental sacrifices for their kids' well-being, ultimately establishing a heartwarming and loving tone."
1799	13625	5	3	"The mood in the author's story is happy and grateful. Happy because even though it was a new country, they came with a purpose and are living it with their culture which is passed down family to family. ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends and careers in the country they loved."" They built a new life, embracing new opportunities while cherishing their heritage. Also grateful because he sees what his parents did and does for him so he could be happy. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" ""I was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love!"" It's this combination of cultural pride and deep appreciation that defines the joyful and thankful tone of the author's reflection."
1800	13626	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is proud. The author was proud because he was growing up as a loving, caring child in the US. Also, he was proud that even though his family moved to the US from Cuba, he still practices his Cuban culture. Another reason that he was proud is that he has loving parents that want him to be successful in life. His parents helped him keep up with his culture by having family come over. ""My Aunt Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary regularly joined us at our table."" (p. 1) This quote shows that Narciso Rodriguez's family came to join his parents and him for dinner. These gatherings helped to reinforce his Cuban identity. Narciso’s family gave up everything, including leaving Cuba, so he can have a better life. A life that his family can be proud of, and, ultimately, that he can be proud of as well."
1801	13627	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is nonfiction. The mood is that because Narciso Rodriguez is telling about his past, and it is about the life he once lived in New Jersey, in a Cuban, Italian, and Spanish neighborhood. The house was transformed into a home by his parents, his surrogate grandparents, and himself. The home he lived in was a blonde-bricked apartment, filled with Cuban Aromas and Cuban musics. The mood became joyful because of the Family's love of Cuban Music, and Cuban cooking, (which is really good), filling the air with vibrant energy. The mood also is represented with the Family, a loving and caring family in a nice apartment building, creating a safe and welcoming atmosphere. The mood is non-fiction, joyful, loving, and caring; I know this because the ""home"" is so pleasant to be inside, radiating warmth and affection."
1802	13628	5	3	The mood was created by the author in the memoir and specific information. The mood is like something in the sky, that's why I think about the mood; it's vast, perhaps even a little overwhelming, and colors everything. It shapes how the events are perceived and felt.
1803	13629	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood created by the author was loving, caring, and appreciative. Loving is what they did most because they basicly called everyone thier family. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says that ""My parents always kept thier arms and thier door open to the many people we call family, knowing that they would do the same for us"". Another mood was caring, because they wanted thier children to have a better life. A example is ""My mother and father had to come to this country with such courage, to give thier children a better life, leaving thier friends, families, and career in the country they loved"". This shows they care about thier kids. One last mood is appreciative. ""The barriers to work were strong and high, my parents had to accept that they both might not be able to find the Jobs they deserve, they had to start thier life over. This highlights how the author feels about the sacrifices made. These are the moods that was created by the author."
1804	13630	5	3	"The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives is Love and Nostalgia. Love is shown in this excerpt by how grateful he is for his parents and how he feels about them. In paragraph one he says ""I often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Nostalgia is shown by the way Narciso described the house he grew up in. Stated in paragraph two that ""Here, in innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Love and Nostalgia are expressed all throughout this memoir, and I stated just a few examples of it, demonstrating the powerful emotions Rodriguez evokes through his reflections."
1805	13631	5	3	The author created such a specific mood for this memoir. She KICKS off by telling a little history of how she came to be in MIAMI but quickly changed it to what her home was like. Narciso emphasized the importance of her culture but more importantly her family and friends. She talked about how the latin music, the big cuban cooking all made what is her home. She focuses more on the gratitude of her parents even more than her heritage and family bonds. She's focused on how her parents made a house a home, highlighting their love and dedication. Ultimately, the memoir showcases how family can create a sense of belonging and warmth, making any space feel like home.
