1	8863	4	3	The author concludes the story with this because gardens cannot grow with snow on the ground. So she figures when all the snow is melted she'll try to grow another one. I feel as if she wasn’t happy enough to grow another garden; I think she should be more interested in growing it than disappointed. It seems like she views it as a chore to be done when the weather permits, rather than an activity filled with potential joy and discovery, suggesting a less than enthusiastic approach to the next attempt.
2	8864	4	3	The narrator has that in with Paragraph because it all makes sense and it goes along together. The narrator says that when the geese come out and the hibiscus is budding is because it is once more again springtime. The return of the geese and the hibiscus's budding are clear indicators of the season. It's a time of renewal and rebirth that the narrator associates with the paragraph's coherence. Therefore, the connection between the natural signs of spring and the paragraph's logical flow underscores a sense of harmony and understanding.
3	8865	4	3	The author concludes the story with that passage to show the importance of the inspiration Saeng gets from the hibiscus plant. Saeng, throughout the story was comforted by the hibiscus plant because it reminded her of home and her grandmother's garden. The plant during the winter metaphorically explains Saeng's attitude towards her new country and her driving test; the hibiscus plant in the winter is not as beautiful in the bitter cold, but it adapts and survives, and returns to its beautiful state in the spring. Saeng is bitter about her new country and driving test, but is adapting, and will be inspired by the beautiful state of the hibiscus in the spring to try her test again, hopeful for a different outcome. In conclusion, the author ended the story in that way to stress importance in the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus plant.
4	8866	4	3	The author ended the story with this paragraph because it shows change. The snow melting represents change from cold to warm, symbolizing the thawing of a previous rigid mindset. The geese returning represents a new life, as in coming back to something semi-new and familiar, yet seen with fresh eyes. Just like the author is going back to drivers ed, ready to approach it with renewed determination. The hibiscus budding represents growth, both literal and figurative. The author will be older and more knowledgeable and more skilled than before, indicating that this return is not a failure but a step in a continued journey of self-improvement and learning, ultimately signifying a positive transformation.
5	8867	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph of, ìWinter Hibiscusî, because it takes us back to things that happened in the story. Saeng failed the test before, a source of disappointment. In the spring the hibiscus will be budding again, a symbol of hope. Saeng realized that many of the things she thought were strange, were almost familiar to her now, a sign of her growing adaptation. The calls of the snow geese were almost familiar to her. The snow melting will tell her that it is now spring, a promise of renewal. Some of the things that might happen as a result of spring coming might be that Saeng will pass the test, finally overcoming this hurdle. Her mother will be proud of her, validating her efforts. Also, Saeng will start to become accustomed to her new country and her new surroundings and stop reminiscing as intensely about her life back in Vietnam, embracing her present and future.
6	8868	4	3	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author wanted to tell about when Saeng will take the test again. The author conveys the passage of time by describing the coming of spring. In spring, the snows have melted, and signs of new life appear with the geese returning and the hibiscus budding. This paragraph provides a vivid image connected to renewal and makes the reader understand the setting of Saeng’s next attempt easier, effectively framing it as a fresh start. This is why the author includes this paragraph in the story, grounding Saeng's future endeavor in the optimistic imagery of spring.
7	8869	4	3	"The story ended with the author saying, ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is upset about spending @NUM1 on a plant that she had felt was different than the plant at home. She is stating that she is not going to take the test of buying one again until the geese return and the Hibiscus budds, symbolizing a renewed sense of hope and a fresh start after her disappointment. Saeng's vow marks a pause, a period of reflection before she is ready to confront the challenge again, aligning her decision with the natural cycle of rebirth."
8	8870	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph helps bring the story to a closing. In the paragraph she is basically saying when the geese return and my flower is budding I'll be prepared enough to take the test. She'll be prepared because she'll be adapted enough and she'll have experienced enough just like the plant and the geese. She is comparing her life to the lives of the geese and the life of her flower, suggesting that just as they follow natural cycles of growth and return, she too will be ready when the time is right, signifying a hopeful and natural conclusion to her journey.
9	8871	4	3	The author would conclude the story with that paragraph because she failed the test before, a stinging memory that fuels her current determination, and she desperately wants to pass it this time to prove something to herself. It makes you wonder if she will pass it or not, leaving the reader in suspense about her future success and the potential consequences of either outcome.
10	8872	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by Minfong Ho, it concludes with a good ending. The girl buys a hibiscus that reminds her of home in Thailand. She goes home and tells her mother she failed her test but bought the plant instead. While she was planting it, she saw geese flying overhead, and she was reminded of the rice paddies back home. America was starting to feel more like home, and she was happier. In the text she says, ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now."" She is willing to give the test another try and is now confident that she will pass it. America is now starting to feel a little more like home, showing that she is adapting and finding comfort in her new environment."
11	8873	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story started out by Saeng failing the test, going out and buying a plant to comfort her and confessing to her mom. The plant related to her by the memories of her homeland, and when she failed that test she felt very depressed and sad. She cried to show her pain and bought a plant to cheer her up, connecting it to happier times. As she told her mom she felt the pain again but, her mother, understanding her distress, made her favorite food and helped her plant the plant. She knew that it wasn’t like the old plant but, it represented the thought and memories, and she knew that she couldn’t just give up, so when the time was right, she was going to try the test again. It relates because it helps the readers understand the story a little better and shows that she wasn’t going to just quit, highlighting her resilience. Her mother was very understanding, providing both emotional support and a tangible symbol of hope and perseverance, and when she goes to retake the test, she will be prepared, not just academically, but also emotionally strengthened by her experience.
12	8874	4	3	I think he concluded the story with that paragraph because he described the cyclical nature of things in the story and then reported it. So, when the geese left, the story suggests they will inevitably return and then leave again, mirroring life's rhythms; that's what I think taking the test again means, a recurring cycle.
13	8875	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when everything starts coming back, the fragmented memories and lost sensations returning to her, she will finally feel whole enough, present enough, to face the daunting test. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, signaling a hopeful, if uncertain, step forward in her journey.
14	8876	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show a sense of determination that Saeng posesses. When Saeng comes back and shows her mother the hibiscus plant, she is very upset, with tears in her eyes. Her mother at first is disappointed in her for buying the plant, but is then understanding when she realizes that Saeng was distraught over leaving her old home. The mother offers to help Saeng plant the hibiscus, which comforts Saeng a little bit, helping her gain the determination she needs to recover and adjust to her new surroundings. The story says ìAlmost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.î This quote states that Saeng realizes that things at home, while different, can eventually become comfortable and routine, just like things were in her old country. The author uses the term ìfamiliarî to express that Saeng is starting to accept the fact that some things will be different, but she will eventually get used to it, making her view on life more positive and solidifying her resolve to build a new life.
15	8877	4	3	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because in the paragraph there is a lot said that is the main part of this story. For example all the names and talks about the seasons and their comparisons and differences, and it talks about different buddings, like when you get your mids, your nuggets, and headies of the plant. Because hibiscus is a new form of something nice, the paragraph serves as a comprehensive summary, encapsulating the core themes and elements explored throughout the narrative.
16	8878	4	3	He states this as the conclusion because it shows the faith that she has in the flower and how it will bring her luck for her upcoming test. She feels like the familiar flower is out of place, just as she is in her unfamiliar surroundings, and they can relate to somethings, creating a sense of comfort and shared experience which ultimately reinforces her belief in its lucky properties.
17	8879	4	3	I believe the author concludes the story with Saeng because it shows when she is reminded of home. I believe she thought she could pass the test when the flower was blooming and reminded her of home. For example, Saeng mumbled, ìNot like the kind we had before.î This suggests to me that she was probably homesick, missing the familiar blooms of her homeland. Then when spring comes and the flower blooms, its unique fragrance and vibrant color could give her the strength and renewed determination to pass the test. This connection to her roots provides her with a sense of comfort and motivation. This is why I believe the author ended with this paragraph, highlighting the importance of home and memory in Saeng's journey.
18	8880	4	3	The author uses it because Saeng got confidence back from planting the hibiscus and everything that happened that year. So now she’s ready, and that’s what the author wanted the reader to figure out, demonstrating Saeng's growth and newfound self-assurance as a direct result of her experiences.
19	8881	4	3	"The author concludes the story this way because Saeng failed the test, the hibiscus comforts her, and she feels she is similar to the geese. For example, Saeng says ìI-I failed the test.î She has admitted to failing the test and is upset about it and wants to ìtake that test again."" Furthermore, this shows her determination. Saeng says,"" And that rich sweet scent- that was familiar, too, ìwhile describing the hibiscus. The familiarity of the plant comforts her and will allow her to build up the courage to ìtake the test again.î Ultimately, it gives her hope. Finally, at one point Saeng thinks to herself, ""the quiet repetition of season opon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese.î Saeng feels similar to the geese in this way and this allows her to decide to take the test ì when the snow melts and the geese return.î The author concludes the story strongly, describing how Saeng failed the test, how the hibiscus comforts her and she feels similar to the geese; these details all contribute to Saeng's renewed resolve to try again."
20	8882	4	3	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph because she will be reminded of her homeland and going home. The reason I say that is because the geese are returning home and she wants to return as well, signaling a longing for familiar surroundings. Also, the hibiscus will be budding in the wild, just like back home, further reinforcing her connection to her roots and desire to return to a place of natural beauty and comfort. These images of returning geese and blossoming hibiscus collectively evoke a sense of nostalgia and anticipation for her own homecoming.
21	8883	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph by teaching Saeng how to be confident and vow silently, In order to teach her more lessons because of the fact she failed the test in the middle of the passage. Saeng tells her mother that when the snow is gone in the spring time she will retake the test that she failed. Her mother was very upset when she found out that Saeng failed the test the first time, but now seems to realize that perseverance and inner resolve are just as important as passing any single examination, highlighting the lesson learned.
22	8884	4	3	They probably ended it like that to build suspense or leave the reader on a good note because someone might think things are going to get better for them in December, and Saeng might get her license in December. They might get more money in December.
23	8885	4	3	"In *Winter Hibiscus*, by Minfong Ho, the main character, Saeng, undergoes many obstacles as she tries to adapt to her new country, which is very different from her home. The author chooses to end the story as, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author meant to end the story in this fashion to ensure the reader that Saeng has found new hope, which is symbolized by the hibiscus flower. Now, along with budding new hope, the flower also carries a sentimental value, reminding her about her home. Sometimes, the best way to overcome your obstacles is to embrace them, as she did in the greenhouse, tending to the hibiscus, then that leaves room to start anew, allowing her to envision a brighter future and indicating her resilience in facing challenges ahead."
24	8886	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that just because you fail once you shouldn't give up. Saeng's initial disappointment is clear, but the story ends on a note of hope. From what was expressed in the paragraph it was implied to me that Saeng will become stronger by spring and be able to pass the test. She now understands what is required of her and has time to prepare, suggesting a renewed commitment. This underscores the larger theme of perseverance and reinforces the idea that setbacks are simply opportunities for growth and that Saeng's journey is far from over, leading to the strong possibility of her success.
25	8887	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because all things have routines and things they have to do to survive. The geese fly south for the warm months so they don’t die from the cold. The flower that dies in the winter is brought back to life in the spring. This pertains to Saeng because when the geese and the flower come back, she will face her own cycle, taking the test of trying to fit in, in her new country, just as nature adapts and perseveres; that is why the author chose this to end the story.
26	8888	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author ends with the last specified paragraph, ""When they came back...then I will take that test again,"" because it leaves many un-answered questions the reader might have, drawing attention and potentially enticing them to read her next piece of work. The reader is left pondering the significance of ""I failed the test,"" and wanting to know more about ""her gentle grandmother,"" ""Mrs. Lambert,"" and what constitutes ""home"" for the narrator. Another reason the author might end the story this way is to have a dramatic effect on the reader. The reader is left to assume and imagine what is to come. Will she pass the test? Will she go home? What will happen to her? All we know is, ""when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" suggesting a cyclical return and a renewed attempt. Ultimately, the author likely ended the story with that paragraph for dramatic effect, leaving the reader with lingering questions and a sense of anticipation."
27	8889	4	3	"I think that she ended the story like that because it means that she is getting used to all the seasons and their changes. ""In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" She will wait to take the test once it’s not cold anymore, so she will wait until the geese come again, which will be spring by then, and she will feel ready. I think that she is also trying to say that when the snow melts and the geese are there again she will have prepared for the test and pass it with renewed confidence. This is I think she ended it like this because the seasons and their associated symbols now hold a personal significance to her, representing her own cycle of growth and learning."
28	8890	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how everything is changing and adapting to the change. Saeng decides that with this change, she can also adapt to her new life by going back and passing the driver's test again. The hibiscus, a vibrant reminder of her homeland, also represents how something from her past has come to America and must now survive in a new environment. When it begins to bud, a symbol of resilience and growth, Saeng will feel empowered to start adapting to America by passing her driver's test. It’s all about trying to become accustomed to changes, both internal and external. When Saeng feels bad for failing, that’s why something familiar and comforting from her past, like the hibiscus, is such a source of strength and hope, reminding her of her own potential for growth.
29	8891	4	3	"By ending the story with the idea of retaking a test in the spring, the author sets a feeling of starting fresh and perservering. For example, when the author says ""when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding,"" she shows the idea of starting a fresh new life in the spring by returning to their home and the hibiscus is starting fresh by budding again. This is why spring is when Saeng wants to start fresh and retake the test, signifying a new opportunity. The paragraph also shows that Saeng, like the hibiscus, is perservering. The hibiscus is perservering by making it through the winter and blooming again, while Saeng is perservering by retaking the test, demonstrating resilience and determination. The author ends with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up, emphasizing the theme of hope and continued effort."
30	8892	4	3	The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph because Saeng feels most comfortable taking the test again when what she explained happens. Saeng misses where she came from a lot. She promised herself that she would take the test again when that happens. With Saeng saying that, it makes you wonder why she won't take the test again until the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. It makes her feel really comfortable when that does happen, bringing her a sense of peace and connection to her roots that she needs to face the challenge.
31	8893	4	3	The concluding paragraph explains her next goal: obtaining her driver's license. She had to take the written test but failed it, much to her disappointment. She then paid over nineteen dollars for the small potted plant at the local nursery. It reminded her of the vibrant greenery that flourished in her old home's garden. She will have confidence in the spring because the plant, despite being uprooted, grew to its new home, suggesting that she too will grow and thrive in her new environment, finding her own roots and sense of belonging.
32	8894	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because, although she said ìI-I failed the test,î Saeng said, by failing a test doesn’t mean that it’s the end of everything. She will take the test in the spring and she will do her best, so she will likely have more confidence next time she takes the test.
33	8895	4	3	The author concludes the story, ìWinter Hibiscus,î with this paragraph for several relevant reasons. By concluding the story in this way, it shows Saengís growth and more willingness to strive and do her best. When she says she will take the test again, it shows her gain of confidence and her beginning to gain comfort in the place that is not her home country. She is now striving and working toward doing her best to become successful and making the very best of the given situation, indicating a positive shift in her attitude. The author is trying to give more depth and meaning to the study in this way. Saeng went from being nervous and worried when saying, ìI-I failed the test,î to now setting a goal for herself to take it again the time the bud blooms next year. Basically, the author did a full circle by ending the story in this way, moving from speaking of the test to sharing the flower experience with her mother, to stating that she will re-take the test next year, thus emphasizing her resilience and determination.
34	8896	4	3	The author concludes with that paragraph because it shows that despite her sorrow and discomfort, Saeng is able to remain hopeful. In the story, Saeng sees a hibiscus which makes her very homesick for her native country of Vietnam, reminding her of what she left behind. The reader also learns that she failed a test and feels out of place in her new environment, compounding her sense of isolation. However, the hibiscus symbolizes hope and comfort, offering a connection to her past and a promise for her future. The author chooses to conclude with that paragraph because despite Saeng’s hardships, the hibiscus helps her realize that she can overcome her obstacles and be hopeful of the future, suggesting a resilience that allows her to face the challenges ahead.
35	8897	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when Saeng and her mother go back to their home, the flowers were more beautiful than the flowers where they are living now. She wants to plant flowers that are going to remind her of her home and bring a piece of that beauty with them. In the story, Saeng's mother said that these flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here; this winter hibiscus her mother wanted her to know that the only thing that matters is that the plant can last through winter, symbolizing resilience and the ability to adapt to a new environment, which is what they themselves are trying to do.
36	8898	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wanted to show just cause Saeng failed that test don't mean she giving up. She said when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take it again. What the author means is that right now she has failed, but over time she can study and learn more to get ready to retake it. And by the time she ready to take the test the snow with have went away every should be hot out the birds come back and the flower is growing fine. She will take it. And how author ended it lets us know she going to take it but how he use the words let us know that she will not only take it but pass it too, signaling her determination and future success.
37	8899	4	3	The author concludes the story with that because the hibiscus started budding and she’s happy now. So she’s saying after the geese come back and the snow melt, she’s to do it all over again, facing the cycle of seasons and life's challenges with renewed hope each time the hibiscus blooms.
38	8900	4	3	The reason the author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” ends it the way she does is so that we know we can never give up. She fails her driving test the first time, and me being less than a year from taking the test myself, I understand the anxiety. No matter how many times I fail the test, I will never give up. We need to persevere through every problem we go through in life. If we don’t and we just give up, we will never get anything done in life. She vows in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding, she will take the test again. I hope I pass my driving test the first time, just like I did the learner’s permit test. Also, you can’t give up on anything at all, even something small like working; if you stop working, you will lose your job. Never give up, because perseverance, like the promise of spring, ultimately brings new opportunities.
39	8901	4	3	The author added that sentence to the story to show how much Saeng cared about the snow and the plants. She says that she much rather do gardening than school work, preferring the feel of soil to the sight of textbooks. She loves planting new things, nurturing them from tiny seeds to blossoming life. This highlights her deep connection to the natural world, suggesting a passion that transcends academic pursuits.
40	8902	4	3	"The reason why the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because it shows that Saeng is starting to expect the new place she is in. Throughout the story it says how she feels out of place just like the ""winter hibiscus."" Then later in the story she says how, ""many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become, through quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" That quote means that most things she thought of as strange she is now getting used to slowly, which means she is adapting. So, the reason why she says the last paragraph is to show that when everything changes back to spring, the geese come back, and the hibiscus is budding, ""then she will take that test again."" Therefore the author puts the conclusion on the story because it shows how she will adapt as well as the hibiscus, highlighting her growing sense of belonging and anticipation for the future."
41	8903	4	3	The writer leaves the reader with a sense of hope for the future by concluding with this paragraph. Even though the narrator buys the plant in sadness, after she fails her driving test and is missing her home, it is still a symbol of hope. She means that when the flower is blooming, her hope will be also and she will try again, maybe this time with success. Right now she might be sad and scared, but she knows that things will work out, and she will be fine. She is finally settling into her new life and says that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.” She means that even though she misses her homeland so much, she is slowly getting used to her new home, and her new life. And maybe by the spring she will be happy and comfortable here, comfortable enough to try her driving test again. The hibiscus represents both the longing for the past and the hope for the future.
42	8904	4	3	"I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is most comfortable when she is surrounded by things from her homeland. She thinks she will be ready to take the test when she sees the ducks again, and when the hibiscus begins to bud. The narrator says, ""High hedges, tall and high, had surrounded their garden"" is evidence that Saeng had hibiscus in Vietnam, and the story of the well reminds her of it, reinforcing the connection to her past. The narrator also says, ""Overhead, a flock of geese, their faint looks clear and -yes-familiar to Saeng now,"" proves that the geese symbolize home also, providing a sense of belonging and familiarity in a new environment, and thus she can reconcile her future and her past."
43	8905	4	3	I believe the author concludes with that quote for an assortment of reasons. One is to show that the character isn’t just going to give up, that her failing isn’t the end for her. This imparts a moral of never giving up. It feels as if the character is referring to the hibiscus sentimentally. “The hibiscus will be budding” which implies that she herself will branch out and learn more. By springtime, she would have learned and experienced enough to try to pass the test again. The hibiscus also reminds her of her home, and looking at it will give her the courage to pull through and face her challenges, like her test. The ending quote wraps up the story, highlighting the character’s will to persevere and always try again.
44	8906	4	3	"The author uses this concluding paragraph to draw the whole story together. She speaks of the driving test, geese, and the hibiscus plant – three subjects found in the story. When she says ""when the snow melts and the geese return"", she is referring to the geese mentioned when she says ""She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky"". She went through a change, much like the geese do every winter as they migrate and adapt. She realizes ""that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become...familiar to her now"". We all have to go through changes; Saeng just had a bigger one, adapting to a new culture and finding comfort in her surroundings."
45	8907	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wrote the same thing that it had in the paragraph and he wrote it in his story but added a little more details to it, weaving in complexities and obstacles along the way. He essentially took the essence of that paragraph and fleshed it out, developing the initial idea with richer descriptions and introducing compelling conflicts that tested the characters and advanced the plot, making the final paragraph a satisfying resolution to the expanded narrative.
46	8908	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng is respectful and how her feelings miss her homeland. The first example, when ""Saeng vowed silently to herself,"" shows her respect and longing for her homeland. It suggests she wants to try again, addressing her past failures. The line stating her desire to overcome her past failures reinforces this idea. The final line of the paragraph, ""then I will take that test again,"" emphasizes her desire for another chance, highlighting her resilience and connection to her roots."
47	8909	4	3	"The author had concluded this story with this paragraph to make it as if they were on a clean slate, like they had started over, so the past no longer haunts them. Saeng sounds as if she has a bit of relief after she takes her mom the plate, perhaps feeling a sense of duty fulfilled and a step towards reconciliation. I believe that she feels better because at the end of the paragraph she sounds sure of herself, a stark contrast to her earlier uncertainty. She sounds certain, as if she wants to start over, because she says ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” To me, she sounds like a brand new person, who has forgotten about the past and is ready to face the future with renewed determination."
48	8910	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the plant is noticed when she is coming home after failing the driving test. So she says when everything is right, meaning when her plant is flourishing, she will take the test again. The driving test is not all that important to her; she isn’t even sure she will pass it though, so she wants to go take it again when the plant she bought is budding and at its best point, symbolizing a time of personal growth and good fortune.
49	8911	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how much Saeng has grown because of this experience, and how determined she is. This last paragraph offers a sudden happy ending to a rather sad story, but gives the reader hope, knowing the main character is confident enough to try again. The whole story was filled with sadness about Saeng’s family having to move to a new country and start all over. However, the one thing that acts as an escape for them is their gardening. In Vietnam, they seemed to have a nice garden and enjoyed working with it very much. Now that they're in their new location, their garden and the plants in it remind them of that homeland, and how their life used to be. Although saddened by not passing her driving test, Saeng finds a plant that makes her happy and seems to rejuvenate her hope of passing the test. The final paragraph seals the deal, as it shows that she is again confident in herself because of the happy memories that she is thinking about, demonstrating her resilience and positive outlook for the future.
50	8912	4	3	The author used the last paragraph because the hibiscus is a symbol for Saeng. It shows that she will be ready when spring comes. When the plant is ready to bud, she will have faith about taking the test, drawing strength from the hibiscus's own growth. She'll probably want to nurture the plant, ensuring it thrives before she takes the test. When the plant buds, symbolizing her own readiness, Saeng won't have to worry about its initial care anymore, freeing her to focus on the test.
51	8913	4	3	"I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because Saeng is saying when the good time comes back around she will try for the test again because she had failed it. For example on page @NUM1 at the top she says ""I-I falled the test,"" showing her disappointment. This reinforces why the author concludes the story in this way, because it emphasizes that passing the test was important to Saeng, and she intends to persevere and try again when the favorable season of Spring returns."
52	8914	4	3	"""Winter Hibiscus"" is about a girl, Saeng, who moved from Vietnam to the United States. After she fails her driver’s test, she walks home and finds a hibiscus. “She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair…” She goes to a flower shop to see if it can be purchased. She pays a lot of money for the plant because it is rare and valuable. It is special to her because she used to have hibiscus plants in Vietnam, reminders of her old home. She brings the plant home and tells her mom that it reminds her of Vietnam. The mom says that it reminds her of Vietnam too, bringing back memories of their life before. The mom is not happy with how much Saeng paid for it, thinking of their current financial situation. She plants it in her garden. When the hibiscus was lowered in the ground, a flock of geese flew by, as if welcoming it to its new home. When the hibiscus returns in the spring, Saeng will take her driver’s test again. In the spring, all the flowers start to bud and bloom, signaling a time of renewal. Everything is new again. Saeng will have a new chance to pass her test, symbolizing a fresh start in a new country."
53	8915	4	3	"I think that is included because she is comparing herself to a flower. When she grows again like a flower, she will go prove to the past that test. She’s saying there's always a second chance, and she wants to tell everyone that it’s not too late to fix a miss or a mistake. For an example, ""they said there were many things that she had thought of strangely, season upon season,"" showing her resilience and determination to overcome past challenges and see things differently, ultimately illustrating the enduring hope for a fresh start."
54	8916	4	3	"The author concludes the story like that because she wants everybody to know how she feels about the hibiscus. She felt like the hibiscus was a wonderful plant. She described its leaves as ""smooth and cool"" toward the end of the first page. When she first saw the plant back in Vietnam she thought that is just grew wildly. Then when she saw it in the United States she was surprised that it grew in a pot. For example she described the smell of the hibiscus as a ""sweet scent."" This is why she concluded the story like this; because of how she felt about the plant, and she clearly wanted to convey her admiration for its beauty and adaptability."
55	8917	4	3	The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows Saeng's passion for gardening. Her willingness to take the test signifies her commitment to nurturing plant life. She's eager to see if her plants can thrive when spring arrives. The anticipation of the hibiscus budding fuels her resolve, and she will attempt to cultivate it, illustrating how anxious Saeng is for gardening and to try and get the hibiscus to grow during the spring, demonstrating her dedication to bringing life to her garden.
56	8918	4	3	The author concludes the story with this to mean that when everything is back to normal and beautiful, that is when Saeng will take the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she likes working in the garden in the spring. Also, it means that Saeng feels that she does better in school during the spring time, suggesting a connection between her academic performance and the revitalizing energy of the season.
57	8919	4	3	Change and disappointment are enough to over-come. Some people have an arid fear of change. For Saeng, the main character from ìwinter Hibiscus,î change comes in the form of a move to @LOCATION1, a place vastly different from her previous home. Everything around her is different and new, presenting unexpected challenges. Coupled with the disappointment of failing her driver's exam, the feeling of living helpless overwhelms her. After buying a winter hibiscus plant, she vows to take the test again when it blooms in the spring. The resiliance of the winter flower and the memories it represents inspire Saeng to try again, showcasing her determination to adapt and thrive despite initial setbacks.
58	8920	4	3	I think the author wanted to express Saeng's emotions when she took a vow, and also to express the author's own feelings about that moment. The statement, in addition to portraying Saeng's commitment and inner state, was also likely intended to pique readers' interest. Primarily, though, it seems its purpose was to aid comprehension of the significance surrounding Saeng's decision and its impact.
59	8921	4	3	"For shadowing, future reference, continuous behavior—all are reasons why that is the last paragraph. They foreshadow because she states her future intentions. She is referencing what she plans to do, maintaining a continuous behavior. She says she will do something again next year, indicating sustained action. She says, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Thus, foreshadowing, future reference, and continuous behavior are strong reasons why her statement is significant, effectively portraying her planned actions for the coming year."
60	8922	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story like this to show a sense of continuation in life. In the story, Saeng takes a test and fails. She goes out and buys a hibiscus plant for well over what she should have paid for it. Her test is to try to get over the memories of her real home that Saeng now only cries about when she thinks of it. To Saeng, the plant represents memories and a life that she once had, but no longer does, however does want it back. Her vow to herself is that when the geese come flying back over her, a sign of the changing seasons and the cyclical nature of life, she will go back to the greenhouse that reminds her so much of her home and try once again to say “home” without breaking down, and without having something extremely expensive, revealing her hope for healing and a return to a sense of normalcy.
61	8923	4	3	"In 'Winter hibiscus' by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator never clearly indicates what test Saeng has failed. However, through subject matter and word choice it is clear that the test is not only important to Saeng and her mother, but also to her new life in @LOCATION1, America. Throughout the story Saeng's longing for her homeland is overpowering. The flood of memories that came back to her when she purchases the hibiscus, are obviously painful and part of her everyday life. Saeng is working hard to keep her memories of Vietnam alive, while knowing that she must learn to live the @CAPS2 American customs and lifestyle. There are some things she doesn't need to change, like passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits alive; she can use them as motivation. This is why the last sentence of the story is so empowering, because she has learned to use the @NUM1 two things together – memory and change, ""when this hibiscus is budding I will take that test again,"" showing her determination to succeed while honoring her past."
62	8924	4	3	"The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to show that the girl had adapted to her new country. Saeng missed her home deeply. It was hard for her to say her country was home without crying. ""It's not like the wind we had at-at-,"" she'd often lament. She also spent @MONEY1 on a plant because it reminded her of home and provided a sense of comfort. One could infer she adapted because she was familiar with the season change and the comfort it brings, and it states when the geese return she is going to take the test again, demonstrating her resilience and determination to integrate into her new life."
63	8925	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes Saeng feel more at home. For example it says, ""the snow melt, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" I think the author says this because all the things in that sentence remind her of home and offer her a sense of hope. The return of the geese and the blossoming hibiscus, for example, are natural signs of renewal and familiar aspects of her homeland. Therefore, when winter is over and these signs of life reappear, she will feel more connected to her roots and better prepared to face the test."
64	8926	4	3	The reason why the author ended with Saeng vowed is because she is very committed. She failed the first time, but now she really wants to pass it, so she is waiting until the snow melts and the geese return, and as the hibiscus is budding, she will come back, her resolve strengthened by the passage of time and the promise of spring.
65	8927	4	3	I think that the author concluded the story like that because of who throw out the whole Story the plot was in the winter. She might wanted to try it in a different season to see if she might to better with the whot setvation and explore how the characters would react under different environmental conditions. That is why I think the author concluded the story like that.
66	8928	4	3	I think the author finished the story with this paragraph for the following reasons. Saeng really means she will take the test in spring. I say that because she says when the snow melts and geese return, meaning next spring she will take the test again. She is saying this with confidence because she started to add more descriptive details about the coming season, showing her anticipation and resolve. For example, she added “hibiscus is budding.” Saeng is determined to pass the test, as evidenced by her focus on the positive signs of renewal and growth, suggesting a fresh start and renewed effort; this is why it was the last paragraph, highlighting her hope and what she meant by it, suggesting a cyclical return to the challenge with renewed vigor.
67	8929	4	3	The author concludes the story with in the spring when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again, because she is saying there will be a new year. For example he failed it the first time she will wait until she tries again, signifying a fresh start and renewed hope. Another example is that she just wants to try until she gets her driving license, demonstrating perseverance and a commitment to achieving her goal. Ultimately, the return of spring symbolizes not just a change in seasons, but also the opportunity for repeated attempts and eventual success.
68	8930	4	3	In this story Saeng shows her mother how passionate she is with planting and her passion for plants. The author includes the paragraph in the story so that it can show how the character Saeng feels about her planting. One reason why this shows that she has passion for planting is because it says “I will try this test again,” meaning that if she is doing something that she enjoys doing then she will try it again and again until she is fully pleased. This persistence highlights her dedication and love for the process, revealing that Saeng's passion for planting drives her to overcome challenges and continuously improve her skills, solidifying her enthusiasm.
69	8931	4	3	The author concludes that in the paragraph. I think he concluded that in these because it shows a lot of confidence about her. For example when she said, “then I will take that test again.” It sounded very confident and made it where she can want to try if she fails the first time, demonstrating a resilient attitude and a belief in her ability to improve. This ultimately shapes the author's concluding perspective.
70	8932	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she has not given up on her dreams. Despite the setbacks and the daunting climb ahead, the memory of the small victories, the encouraging words, and the unwavering belief in her own potential continue to fuel her resolve. The path may be winding and arduous, but she remains committed to pursuing her aspirations, holding onto the hope that one day, she will reach the summit.
71	8933	4	3	Hope, a new beginning, adjustment—all are reasons why the speaker concludes by saying “when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” That hibiscus flower gives that girl hope because it reminds her of her grandmother and back home, how wonderful things were back there, and by the flower blooming, she realizes it could work out there too. She’ll also have a new beginning in the spring; by spring she should adjust to her surrounding and have new friends, things to do, and new memories to look back on, so looking back about fall won't be as bad. Ultimately, the flower will bring her hope and comfort along with her adjustment, allowing her to face the test again with renewed optimism.
72	8934	4	3	The author is saying that she’s not doing anything until it is a nice day outside. She wants it to be not too cold but not too hot either, so she can come out and play with her children. Then she said she will take her test again, waiting for a nice day outside; therefore, weather conditions are a motivating factor for her activities.
73	8935	4	3	The author ends the story with this conclusion to show that Saeng is very passionate about connecting her life in the United States, to how life was in Vietnam and bringing them together somehow. In the story, Saeng talks about how she misses home and how she is still trying to adapt to her new life away from the home she knew; when Saeng says that she has failed the test and wants to take it again, she means that she wants to show that she can survive in the United States without disappointing her mother. When Saeng spent $25 on a plant, her mom was in disbelief because Saeng knows how hard it is to survive. When the conclusion says, “I will take the test again,” it shows that Saeng is willing to try to make it in the United States from Vietnam, proving that she can make a better life for herself and her family by working hard, while still keeping traditions in Vietnam alive. Saeng simply wanted to make her new home feel like Vietnam by buying a plant she knew her mother would like, ultimately demonstrating her unwavering commitment to bridging her two worlds.
74	8936	4	3	The author might have concluded this story because it feels like a downfall. Which means he's at the bottom and has to make it to the top. He is going to start over and take the test again, but this time he is not going to fail, suggesting a path toward redemption and eventual success after this low point.
75	8937	4	3	"This last paragraph gives emotion to know she can't garden due to winter. In the winter time all of her plants die for the season. The author is just saying saeng is coming back, offering a sense of hope. After the snow, frosts and cold weather are gone, Saeng will come next season so she can continue with her gardening, plants and soil. As said, ""I will take the test again"" - saeng. Meaning Saeng will return and face the test of effort with her gardening and her mother next time/next season when life starts to grow again, signifying a cyclical return and renewed determination."
76	8938	4	3	I think that the author concludes with that paragraph as his ending because that is what the girl is going to be doing for the following year that is going to pass, and she will still be with her mother helping her out in the garden. Without friends, she is only letting her mom in. This makes it a fitting conclusion because it provides a sense of closure, highlighting the enduring bond between mother and daughter and suggesting a continuation of their shared life.
77	8939	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng has found hope from the hibiscus plant. Like the plant, Saeng is going to overcome an obstacle. She will try the driving test again, and the plant will overcome the harsh, brutal winter months. The plant will bloom in the spring and show its resilience during adversity. Saeng, too, will overcome the adversity she faced when failing her driving test and realizing how much she missed her homeland. Saeng too, in a sense, will bloom in the spring. The winter, representing her despair and homesickness, will not prevent her from living happily and taking the test over. The hibiscus reminds her of home. The story ends with the paragraph to show how the “Winter Hibiscus” has taught her something about overcoming obstacles, ultimately revealing her own inner strength and determination.
78	8940	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is going to accept her new home and recognize the similarities from her old home and hold memories close to help her overcome obstacles that she is facing in life. ""I've seen this kind blooming along the lake. It's flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters."" This sets similarities from their old home to their new home, demonstrating a connection despite the change in environment. This shows that things do change but they are also the same at their core. This leads to the conclusion because this is where Saeng realizes that she will always have the memories of her old home and will use them to help her overcome the troubles she's going through, finding strength in resilience and adaptation."
79	8941	4	3	The author ends the story the way she did to show how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are alike and how Saeng will overcome her obstacle when the plant overcomes its obstacle. Saeng’s obstacle is adjusting to her new life, and the first step in that is passing her driver’s test. The reader knows she has to pass because Saeng tells her mother, “I-I failed the [first] one.” The hibiscus must make it through the winter; it also has to adjust to new surroundings to survive, just like Saeng. The mother says to Saeng, “...but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters [now].” So, if the winter hibiscus’ job, or hurdle that it has to jump, is to make it, to stay alive during the winter months, then its job will be done in the spring. The author ends the story with Saeng telling herself, “...in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” [and pass it]. If Saeng’s obstacle is completing, and passing the driver’s test, and she passes in the spring, right as the hibiscus passes its “test,” the symbolism between the two, showing determined spirits to adapt, will grow deeper because they will adapt and pass their obstacle at the same time. This parallel resolution underscores the theme of resilience and the ability to thrive in new environments.
80	8942	4	3	I think that the story came back to this because that is what the story starts off with. It all started with Saeng going to take a test, specifically her driver's test, but she did not pass it. So when the weather is better, and perhaps she's had more practice, she would have a better time trying to pass that test. This is why I think she came back to the test, to ultimately achieve her goal of getting her license.
81	8943	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story this way is because she wanted to leave the reader in suspense, wanting more. You can tell because it never really says what the test is, adding to the mystery. She wanted you to try and guess what the test is, and perhaps even ponder its significance. When Saeng walked up to her mother, she had told her that she failed the test, but the nature of that test remains elusive, leaving the reader to contemplate the possible reasons for her failure and ultimately, the story's unanswered questions.
82	8944	4	3	"The author ends the story with that paragraph to give us insight into a potential next story. I think there will be another story because there are clues to support my theory. Just at the beginning of the paragraph, it hints at future events right when they come back. Then, at the end, it states, ""then I will take the test again."" It didn't say ""happily ever after"" or anything similar; it just stated those personal changes mentioned. So I think the author will write another story so we could see if Saeng will pass her test, leaving the possibility open and suggesting a continuation of Saeng's journey."
83	8945	4	3	The author ended with this paragraph because it is an example of how everything gets a fresh start in the spring. An example of this is that the geese will return home after the winter to start a new family, and also in the winter the hibiscus leaves will die, and then in the spring they will have a new start. I think the author uses this paragraph last because it’s a metaphor of how everything will get a fresh start, and also Saeng will get a new chance to take her driving test just like the plant and geese will get a new chance at life, suggesting a hopeful outlook for her future endeavors.
84	8946	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because these geese coming back symbolize Saeng’s determination and hope that she needs to pass the driving test. Like the geese who migrate and return, she will wait for the winter to pass so that she can pass the test. The coming of spring also symbolizes renewal and birth, a fresh start. Saeng will have the chance again to pass the driving test with renewed faith and encouragement, a sense of rebirth after her setback. This is a great way to end the story because it is really deep and makes the reader think about the meaning of the scene and how the geese, hibiscus plant, and spring arriving effect the conclusion of the story, leaving them with a sense of optimism for Saeng’s future.
85	8947	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to say that he will wake up in springtime when the snow melts and geese return. Also I think that the author likes the setting of spring, also to see the sunny skies and geese floating in a pond. I also would like that setting because it gives me more ideas, and it's a very lovely setting to be around. That is why I think the author picked that paragraph to conclude the story, offering a sense of hope and renewal at the end.
86	8948	4	3	"The short story, Winter Hibiscus, is about a girl who moved with her mother to America. The story tells about the girl's transition into the different culture. During the story, the author makes references to the daughter having to pass a test. At the end of the story the author wrote “In the spring…then I will take that test again.” In the text, the girl says “it’s-it’s not a real one,” when referring to the winter hibiscus plant she bought. The reader could infer that this quote means that the girl has memories of home, but they are not the real thing. Also the author wrote “…much preferred it to the Big Mac"". This quote shows that she misses her own culture & cannot adapt to the American one that she lives in now. In conclusion, the girl's test may be that she needs to be able to handle change & also be able to recall memories of her homeland with happiness instead of sadness."
87	8949	4	3	The author concludes the story with that ending because he wanted to show the reader “if you just try, you might like it,” and that’s why the girl said she would come back next spring when the snows melt so she can take the test again, demonstrating her newfound willingness to persevere despite initial difficulties.
88	8950	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it brings everything together. One way it ties everything together is by revisiting what happened in the beginning and connecting it with why she had bought the flower in the first place. It also connects Saeng's old memories from Vietnam to her new way of life in the United States. The story states ""carefully Saeng picked it up and smiled. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs."" This shows how the flower she found in the flower shop evoked memories from Vietnam, bridging her past and present. This connection between her past and present life is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph, providing a sense of closure and understanding of Saeng's journey."
89	8951	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it's telling/showing us that Saeng is going to try to pass the test in the spring. Getting that hibiscus reminded her of her homeland and it gave her memories of then. And it also made her believe in herself and want to get there and try again. It made her hopeful. The author mentions ""when snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" to help indicate that it's going to be spring when she tries to take her test again, suggesting a time of renewal and a fresh start for Saeng."
90	8952	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because, after all that has happened, like she failed the test, he wanted the ending to be remembered as a happy thing. He also wanted the end to show how something bad happened, but next, she was going to do it again. The author wanted to show that she wouldn't give up; she goes after what she wants, and he wanted that resilience to be the lasting impression of the story.
91	8953	4	3	The author concludes the story the way that they did to signify that the girl will not give up trying to pass her test and will adapt to her new found home and make it what her home in Vietnam was to her. The girl is reminiscent of her past life and wishes to go back and have the life she had in her home country. When she is homesick, she perseveres in her studies and embraces her new environment, indicating her determination to create a fulfilling life despite the challenges, thereby suggesting a hopeful outlook for her future.
92	8954	4	3	"The Author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it is resolutive to the entire reading before it. In the story Saeng (the girl) had been stressed from failing the @CAPS1 test. She was also saddened by the memory of the hibiscus plant back in her native country Vietnam. At the end of the story when it says ìwhen the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" ,(Ho) the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding symbolize change and adoption. Saeng will need to change and adapt to a new life to pass the test and feel better. These images suggest a hopeful future, a contrast to her present struggles with cultural adjustment. This is why the Author @CAPS2 Ho, of the story ìWinter Hibiscusî used a strong, symbolistic and resolutive end to her story."
93	8955	4	3	After Saeng fails her driverís test, she gives up hope for the future. The sight of the hibiscus plant reminds her to never give up, no matter how tough the situation. In the story, Saengís mother says, ìIts flowers arenít as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. Thatís what matters.î This quote shows how even though it's not an object of beauty, it can do what it takes to survive. Saeng feels that she is also like the hibiscus, having the strength to be able to survive in a new environment. Even though she is new to this country, Saeng had proved that no matter how big the situation, anything can be overcomed if you believe in yourself and your family, ultimately illustrating her resilience and ability to adapt.
94	8956	4	3	The author probably used this as the last paragraph to show that at this time next year she is going to take the test again. The author writes this paragraph to show that she failed the test when the geese were going away for winter and the hibiscus was blooming, circumstances suggesting a less-than-ideal testing environment and perhaps highlighting the author's disappointment as nature prepared for a dormant season, resolving to try again with renewed determination.
95	8957	4	3	The author concludes the story the way he/she did because it shows how much the plant truly means. S'aeng is going to wait till the flower blooms because it means so much to her; she will nurture it until then. The flower represents her and her driving test. When the hibiscus is ready to bloom, she will be ready to drive. The plant gives her hope for a new tomorrow, a new chance. The last paragraph helps the reader realize how much the plant means to the girl, its significance. It makes her feel more at home, and her home makes her feel stranger; makes her joyful and happy after the misery of failing the driving test, giving her something to look forward to.
96	8958	4	3	"She concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants him to come again @DATE1. She says ""when the snow melts."" She wants to look at the events again and take care of them, hoping for another visit and a chance to revisit their shared experiences."
97	8959	4	3	In this short story, Saeng vows to take the test again in the spring because she knows that she will be able to pass it once she has accepted living in this new place. After Saeng moved, she was very upset and missed her old home, family, and lifestyle. This prevented her from focusing on the test and the necessary studying. However, once she realized that the flowers are beautiful in her new home too, she began to accept the changes around her. The geese being familiar to her symbolizes that she is adjusting to her new lifestyle and finding comfort in the familiar. Saeng also probably made this vow because she didn't want her mother to be disappointed in her again, as she greatly values her mother's opinion. After seeing her mother's disappointment mixed with loving kindness, Saeng was even more determined to pass the test the next time. When Saeng takes the test again in the spring, she will be ready because she has adjusted to and accepted her new life, allowing her to fully dedicate herself to her studies.
98	8960	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because in the being of the story her family moved to the United States from Vietnam. Saeng was walking home from failing her driver's test. She sees a familiar plant. Later she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased. So she gets the plant seeds and plants them so when they start to bloom she will go to her driving test she failed. I believe she will use the flowers for good luck. That is why I believe the author concludes that paragraph in the story, emphasizing Saeng's hope and determination to succeed, connecting her cultural roots with her future endeavors.
99	8961	4	3	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome obstacles, & the next time she has these reminders she will succeed. When she says “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before had become... almost familiar to her now” & this is saying she is getting used to the changes in her new life. This hints at her growing resilience and adaptability, suggesting future success in navigating unfamiliar situations. So the end paragraph effectively reflects these ideas of growth and the potential for future triumph.
100	8962	4	3	In the story, ìWinter Hibiscus,î the author concludes the story with the paragraph for a few reasons. One reason is that she is trying to overcome change and wants to make the situation better. She tries doing that by taking the test again, demonstrating her resilience. The author also concludes with the paragraph because she feels heartbroken that life is not going her way and that she needs to do something about it, highlighting her sense of agency. That's why the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show you if she is determined or not, and ultimately, to reveal whether she will persevere through adversity or not.
101	8963	4	3	I think that the author concluded the story with that paragraph because she is going to see if she can adapt to the new country. This is a good way to leave off the story because you don’t know if she will or not; it leaves you on a cliff hanger. I also think this is a good way to leave it off because she could write a sequel to it and make a series out of it, exploring the challenges and triumphs of adjusting to a completely different culture and way of life.
102	8964	4	3	The author concludes this with the story because the snow is pretty and geese are animals that make it pretty, so they want you to think that our outdoors is the nicest thing around. This imagery of pleasant natural elements likely serves to reinforce a positive perception of the environment being described, leaving the reader with a favorable impression overall.
103	8965	4	3	"The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with that paragraph to show Saeng starting over. The imagery of ""spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" connects to her life, suggesting she is starting fresh in a way. Although she might miss her old life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine-toothed comb, she is making an effort, shown by her decision to ""take that test again."" By retaking the test, she demonstrates that she is not ready to give in to the feeling of loss and to her grief, signifying her resilience and willingness to embrace her new life despite the challenges."
104	8966	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows all of this stuff going on will probably definitely come back up again. Just like how he said the geese will come back every year, so he is definitely saying that all of this will come back up. That is what I think, suggesting a cyclical nature to the events and issues presented.
105	8967	4	3	I think that the author made that the concluding sentence because it means that when Saeng is ready then she will take the test again, implying it's a matter of personal readiness rather than inherent ability. I think that she is comparing herself to the snow, the geese, and the hibiscus. I think so because she says that when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then she will take the test again, using these natural signs as metaphors for her own internal development. So I think that she is saying that she is not ready for the test and when she does get ready, after a period of growth and preparation symbolized by the changing seasons, then that is when she will take it.
106	8968	4	3	The author's conclusion to the story shows how Saeng interpreted the experience of that day. She uses a spring time setting to show when her confidence in herself is reborn. Seeing her hibiscus bud in the spring will give herself a newfound integrity to go try that driving test again, representing a personal resurgence and the courage to face her challenges anew.
107	8969	4	3	Hope, positiveness, helpfulness—all are reasons the author concludes the story with this paragraph. The last paragraph gives the readers a sense that Saeng has hope because she is willing to take the test again, suggesting a belief in a better future. Since she is going to take the test again, it also indicates she wants to help her mother, understanding her mother's aspirations. The last paragraph also gave me the feeling that Saeng has a positive attitude. She bought a flower to replace the dead ones, symbolizing renewal, and she stated that she will re-take the test in the spring, showing resilience. Furthermore, Saeng is helpful to her mother. Saeng finished digging the hole for the new flower for her mother, so her mom could go make dinner, easing her mother's burdens. Saeng also saw the feeling her mom felt when she found out Saeng did not pass the test, motivating her to re-take the test out of consideration. Saeng was feeling just about what any other new kid probably would have felt. She was scared, but through everything Saeng had hope, a positive attitude, and she was helpful, illustrating her admirable character and the uplifting message of the story.
108	8970	4	3	"To her the hibiscus was a test. Saeng felt she failed the test of letting go of the past and embracing ""now."" The hibiscus reminded her of home, so she spent over @MONEY1 on it, knowing she and her mother needed the money for necessities. Essentially, she felt as though she failed a test of prioritizing the present."
109	8971	4	3	"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because they want you to understand Saeng's strength. One reason I think they also end the story like that because she knows inside that when her plant is strong and not covered in snow that she will be strong, and that's when she wants to take her driving test. For example, when she said, ""When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" it shows she connects her personal resilience to the hibiscus's growth. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph, emphasizing Saeng’s hope and determination are intertwined with the natural world."
110	8972	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the main character, Saeng, and her mother moved from their homeland to a new place where everything felt different. She was having a hard time adapting to this new environment, and Saeng even failed an important test, a setback that deeply discouraged her. She tried to reconnect with her memories of home, seeking solace in familiar thoughts and feelings. It was then that she bought the winter hibiscus, hoping its presence would serve as a constant reminder of her roots. However, as she planted the hibiscus, a shift occurred within her. Instead of just longing for the past, she became determined to embrace her present and future. She resolved to retake the test, setting a personal deadline for herself, coinciding with the hibiscus's budding. The author is concluding by conveying hope and determination for Saeng to adapt to her new home, suggesting that even in unfamiliar soil, she can find the strength to bloom.
111	8973	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it adds the uplifting message that Saeng will be able to overcome the obstacles of living in an unfamiliar country. First; the Canada geese represent a piece of her new home because she reasons ìreluctantlyî that they are familiar to her now, This depicts her ability to adapt to her new environment. In addition, she also equates spring to when the hibiscus is budding and the hibiscus is a symbol of herself because both are trying to live in a country that is not their own. Therefore, the hibiscus budding represents her being able to live comfortably in America. Finally, she vows that she will take her drivers test again. Her intial failure to pass the test showed her inability to become a part of America, but if she passes it. Then she will have successfully adapted. Overall, the author of this story concludes with this paragraph because it contains the theme of the passage through an uplifting message of resilience and hope for a brighter future in her new home.
112	8974	4	3	In the story ìWinter Hibiscusî by Minfong ho, the ending includes the hibiscus budding and retaking the test to make a connection between the two. The geese are also included in the end to show the new country she has adapted to because she recognizes when the geese come and go, marking the changing seasons of her new home. The budding of the hibiscus is to her much more than just a flower. It shows the rejuvenation of new life within her, signaling hope and growth, just as flowers tend to bud in the spring. That is also why she chooses to take the test because her ìbuddingî will occur in the spring, and she will have newly born confidence for the upcoming test, reflecting her newfound resilience. That is why the geese, hibiscus, and the test are all included in the end of the story to show the connection between her past home and adaptation to a new lifestyle, symbolizing her journey of embracing change and finding strength in her new environment.
113	8975	4	3	She will try gardening again after the geese and flowers return, hopeful for a fresh start. She wants to have the best garden around, filled with vibrant colors and fragrant herbs. She wants to keep the tradition going, passing down the knowledge and love for gardening to future generations.
114	8976	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng didn’t think the winter hibiscus was in the ground anymore, and she feared that when she got back, all of her plants would be gone due to the snow. So, she resolved that she would take that test again, meaning she would start back at the first steps of nurturing her plants and flowers, recommitting to their care with renewed determination.
115	8977	4	3	"The author concludes, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because Saeng doesn't want to give up yet."" In the story Saeng mumbled, ""I mean, not like the kind at-at- "" She found that she was still too shaky to say the words 'accident' at home. Saeng was still upset because she misses her home in Vietnam and the familiar comforts it offered. When Saeng puts the hibiscus in the ground she feels more alive and Saeng wants to feel at home in the United States and start anew. Saeng isn't going to give up driving but to try, harder and harder to pass the test, finding a sense of purpose in her persistence."
116	8978	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it’s related to what she thinks. When her smile of welcome warmed, Saeng-ìcheep skipped over, alive. To “you’re back,” she saw cheerfully. It’s past time. ""What took you so long?"" Now, ""did it go? Did you?"" She feels very relieved, it’s related to the success of the endeavor. It provides a sense of closure."
117	8979	4	3	ìWhen they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î The story ìwinter hibiscusî ended with this paragraph because it will be a fresh start for Saeng. It will be spring out and the geese will come back to her home where she lives now, which now has the hibiscus to remind her of her old home and its beauty. The paragraph also compares Saeng to the hibiscus, reinforcing the theme of resilience. In the story her mother says, ìIíve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers arenít as pretty, but it is strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. Thatís what matters.î Saeng is the winter hibiscus thatís strong enough to make it through winter, and failing the test wonít matter until spring when she will take it and pass, symbolizing her adaptation and growth. Thatís represented when the hibiscus is in bloom, suggesting renewed hope and determination. I also think the story ended this way because it ties in Saengís feelings throughout the story of her new home and old home, bridging her past and present. Itís also showing her ability to conquer obstacles, mirroring the hibiscus's survival. She is going to forget about failing the driving test and work to pass it in the spring, demonstrating her optimistic outlook and ability to persevere.
118	8980	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because the hibiscus makes them overcome obstacles. She wanted to take the test again so she can prove to her mum that she can pass it. I also think that because the hibiscus gives them strength, she got more confident in herself to pass the test, showing the hibiscus's positive influence on her determination.
119	8981	4	3	The author chose to end the story this way for several reasons. Some of the reasons is that it creates a feeling of hope in the reader, tells us we always have another chance and the importance of persistence. The ending paragraph creates a feeling of hope since it shows how everything will return and others will be another chance. The author chose to put this in the text since it creates a happy note to end on and give the reader happiness of knowing there is hope. Another reason the author chose to end the story with this paragraph is that it tells the reader that you always get another chance no matter what you do. The author wanted to impart this on the reader since it is an important lesson to know, suggesting resilience is key. The ending also tells the reader that persistance is very important in life and almost essential to live. The author shows this by talking about the snow melting, the geese returning and the flower blooming which are things that happen constantly and almost stop because they refuse to give up and die. Therefore, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph for several reasons. The author chose to end it this way since the paragraph gives a lot of hope to the reader and gives the idea of a second chance, offering comfort and reassurance. The author also chose to end with this paragraph since it has several analogies to persistance which is vital in life, solidifying the theme and leaving a lasting impression.
120	8982	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is saying that Saeng likes to do things in the spring when she sees flowers growing because she feels like she is at home, so she feels more confident about passing the test, finding comfort and assurance in the familiar beauty of the season.
121	8983	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concluded the story with the quote ""when they come back, Saeng's vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" The author put this paragraph as the concluding thought to stress that Saeng is determined to make a change. She failed the test but wants to take it again, demonstrating her resilience. Her grandmother's resemblance is in the flower so if the flower buds, then her grandmother will be back in a sense, offering a tangible connection to her past. When her grandmother ""comes back"" then Saeng will feel as if her grandmother is giving her strength and encouragement to try the test again, fueled by memory and love. This cyclical return of nature mirrors Saeng's own renewed commitment."
122	8984	4	3	The author ends with that paragraph to show how Saeng, like the budding Hibiscus, will get a new start in the spring and overcome obstacles. Just as the Hibiscus, though seemingly dormant in winter, holds the promise of vibrant blooms, Saeng, after facing hardships, possesses the inner strength to flourish again. The imagery of the Hibiscus, known for its resilience and beauty, mirrors Saeng's own potential for growth and renewal, suggesting she will find her own vibrant expression despite the challenges she has encountered, demonstrating her capacity to overcome adversity and blossom anew.
123	8985	4	3	"The author concludes the story with, ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I think the author used that conclusion to make the reader want to finish the story on their own, imagining Saeng's future success or struggles. Or, the author could write another story to finish it, detailing Saeng's renewed attempt. Most authors conclude their stories like this, leaving a sense of possibility so the reader is in control about the ending and Saeng's ultimate fate."
124	8986	4	3	Based on my understanding of the story I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to emphasize what will happen as well as to get the reader to thinking and build the excitement and with questions as well as thoughts in the head after reading the passage. It serves to capture the reader's attention as to what follows, wondering if she survives and adapts to the lifestyle she was not used to, and tests her ability to survive the different types of seasons, ultimately conveying that no matter what you face in life, there are always more obstacles ahead of you, leaving the reader pondering her fate and resilience.
125	8987	4	3	The author chose to end the story with that paragraph for emotional meanings. The last paragraph is saying she will re-take the test when the hibiscus is blooming in the spring. She hopes that the blooming hibiscus will give her strength to pass the test. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland and gives her comfort, connecting her to familiar sights and memories. Saeng hopes the sight of the blooming hibiscus will remind her of her home and give her strength to pass the test, bolstering her resolve with a sense of belonging.
126	8988	4	3	The author ends the story in this way because the plant and leaving of the geese represent change to Saeng. The hibiscus isn't the same as she remembers from back home, highlighting the differences she's experiencing. The budding of the hibiscus shows Saeng's happiness stemming from a connection to home. This paragraph shows that the familiarity of the budding plant gives Saeng courage and the ability to overcome her obstacle, the upcoming driving test. The geese in this paragraph represent the keeping of time and the cyclical nature of life. The plant will bud at the time the geese return in the spring, reinforcing this sense of renewal. If the author hadn't included this final paragraph, the full effect of memories for Saeng and their influence on her present wouldn't have been fully portrayed. This implies that Saeng was initially unable to overcome her obstacle because of the newness of this place and her feelings of displacement. When the buds bring her a sense of home and familiarity, she will be able to defeat the obstacle of her driving test because of newfound confidence, thereby proving how important a sense of belonging can be to overcoming personal challenges.
127	8989	4	3	The author includes that because it show that she is not given up. Since she is not given up she can have more trys, increasing her chances of eventual success. This persistence highlights her determination.
128	8990	4	3	"There are many reasons why the author chose to conclude the story with Saeng vowing to attempt the driver's test again. At first, the story begins with a tone of sadness, setting the fact ""as Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test."" This quote sets the tone as sadness because she has failed a very important test, and she is walking alone. ""She sees a familiar plant"" is when the hope comes back into the story. When she brings the plant she purchased to her mother, her mother also seems delighted. ""Where did you get it?"" her mother asked, and Saeng replied, ""I bought it."" She bought it for more money than her mother said for all of the seeds in the garden. As time went on, it was clear to her mother that the plant signifies strength and hope to her daughter, and she ended up delighted with the plant as well. The author chose to conclude the story with Saeng vowing to attempt the driver's test again because her mother felt hope from the plant, which made Saeng happy and gave her courage to try the driver's test again."
129	8991	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes the story longer and it gives it a good ending, providing closure and a sense of resolution for the reader.
130	8992	4	3	the Author concluded the story with this paragraph because the Author was trying to let us know what happened after the story was done, and tried to make it clear. That's why I think that the Author came up with that idea to conclude with that paragraph, to provide a sense of closure.
131	8993	4	3	The author concludes this paragraph because Saeng is going to wait until winter is over so she can have a fresh beginning in the spring. She wants to try again with her own garden because the last time she messed up and tilled the plants too deeply. Saeng wants to become a gardener, following in her mother's footsteps, and she understands that patience is key to a successful harvest.
132	8994	4	3	The author of this essay includes those sentences as the conclusion to make it clear that she will realize that they are coming back. The cyclical nature of trends, once seemingly relegated to the past, inevitably re-emerges, often in altered forms, shaped by new contexts and sensibilities. Though initially dismissed as outdated or irrelevant, these resurrected styles gradually gain traction, fueled by nostalgia, innovation, or a simple desire for something different. Recognizing this pattern allows for a more nuanced understanding of cultural evolution. Ultimately, the anticipation builds, a quiet certainty that the echoes of what was will resonate again, and she will realize that they are coming back.
133	8995	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snowÖî to show that Saeng got stronger. She got stronger because she adjusted to her new home and new environment, learning to navigate the challenges of a different culture and climate. Saeng is more confident in herself to take the test again. She doesnít want to cry again, like she did in her last test, demonstrating a newfound resilience. Being more confident and more adjusted is the reason why she has become stronger, and the reason why she wants to take the test again is because she is stronger, ready to face the future with a renewed sense of determination.
134	8996	4	3	Confidence, persistence, memories ñ all things that Saeng has that helps explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph. Since Saeng moved from her own country, she has not been very happy; she was upset pretty much the whole time and misses everyone and everything from Vietnam; everything she sees reminds her of it. That last paragraph, where it says, ìthen I will take that test again,î shows that she has confidence in herself and wants to try harder next time. She shows persistence when she says she will try again and hopefully, she wonít give up. Saeng misses almost everything from Vietnam, even the food. She also misses her family and how they look and dress. Her memories were probably holding her back from concentrating hard on her driver's test; she knows she wanted to do good so she bought the flower in hopes that would make her feel better. Hopefully, Saengís life will get better in the United States and she will learn to love this country, ultimately finding happiness and a sense of belonging in her new home.
135	8997	4	3	Because with the blooming of the hibiscus plant comes new hope. In the story, she sees the hibiscus as representative of her old life, burdened by past events. With the budding of the plant, symbolizing growth and resilience, starts a new chapter in the young girl’s life, filled with possibilities for the future, ultimately helping her move forward.
136	8998	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he's trying to prove his point. I think that Saeng was comparing herself to the flower. For example the flower was originally a wild flower and then it was planted in a pot. Saeng was a free happy girl but then she had to move to the city. Both the flower and Saeng feel like they are out of place. Since in the story Saeng is similar to the flower then at the end of the story I think that Saeng thinks that if the flower can survive the winter then she can survive in the city and she can pass the test. This is why I think that the author finished with that paragraph to get his message across, emphasizing the theme of resilience and adaptation in the face of change.
137	8999	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story like that is because he or she wants to show Saeng is determined to not fail that drivers test. The author wants to leave Saeng on a good note so she wont be sad after her initial disappointment. When she takes the test again shell be better prepared, having learned from her mistakes, and know what shes expecting. Shell have a better winter, filled with the freedom a driver's license brings, and a renewed sense of confidence.
138	9000	4	3	I think the author concludes the story as he or she did to teach a lesson. No matter what stands in your way or no matter what slows you down never give up. You should keep on trying, pushing through obstacles and setbacks. If you fail something, try again and again until you get it right, demonstrating resilience and determination. This persistence, the author suggests, is ultimately the key to overcoming challenges and achieving success.
139	9001	4	3	Memories, hard work – All are reasons why the author concludes the story with this: “When They come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, Then I will take the test again.” First, courage, because she failed her test first, so it takes some guts and willpower to go back and even try it again. Also, because when she remembers her grandmother, it upsets her, so that definitely takes courage and the human willpower to do her test a second time. Next, memories. I think she keeps wanting to do this test because she has had so many good memories with her grandmother and doesn’t want to ever forget them; but again, it goes back to the willpower, or the want to, to go back and do the test a second time. Last, all the hard work, because she knows what her grandmother meant to her, and through all the things, or hard work, that her grandmother put out, she saw and wants to honor or appreciate all of the stuff that her grandmother did for her. These are the reasons that I think the author ended with that paragraph rather than some other paragraph, showing Saeng's determination to honor her grandmother's legacy.
140	9002	4	3	The author includes the last paragraph to show that she still has hope. It is the last sentence because the author, Fong Ho, wants to show that when all seems lost and you're at the end of the line, you can always hope for the better; when spring comes, so will a new beginning, not only for Saeng's plant but also for her life in a different country, highlighting the enduring power of optimism even amidst challenging circumstances.
141	9003	4	3	"The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî chose to end the story with that paragraph to reenforce the theme of the story and conclude with a hopeful tone. The theme of the story is adjusting to new circumstances and making the best out of each change. ""Saeng vowed silently to herself"" tells the audience that Saeng is making an effort to fit in and find the good in her new life. The hopeful tone that is created is a way to show that Saeng is willing to accept changes in life and wants to do her best to overcome obstacles. She says, ìI will take that test againî. The test represents the obstacles she will overcome when efforts applied. The hibiscus in the sentence ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding..."" symbolizes starting over. The budding hibiscus is compared to Saeng with a fresh start and determination to achieve her goals of adjusting to a new lifestyle, suggesting resilience and growth. The author chose this paragraph to conclude the selection to highlight the theme and symbolize a new start, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism about Saeng's future."
142	9004	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that statement because the audience can then compare Saeng and the hibiscus. After reading that statement, I realized Saeng and the hibiscus are alike because they are both going to make it through and come out on top, (Saeng getting her license and the hibiscus blooming), highlighting their resilience. The author might have ended the story with that statement because it shows that Saeng is committed to working toward her goal and won’t give up, mirroring the hibiscus's persistent beauty. Saeng vowed silently to herself, “I will take that test again,” showing her unwavering determination. Finally, I think the author concluded the story with that statement because it gives the audience the satisfaction of knowing what is going to happen to Saeng but leaving a little mystery for the audience to fill in how they want. For example, I know Saeng is going to take the test again and I believe she will pass it, while another person reading it might believe she failed again and had to retake it again, allowing for a personalized interpretation of Saeng's journey and ultimate success.
143	9005	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to let the reader compare the girl to the geese and the hibiscus. The geese leave for the winter and then come back in the spring, however, the geese also show how the girl is going to come back and take the driver's test again in the spring. The hibiscus dies off over the winter and starts budding again in the spring, this shows that winter is its weakness. Like the hibiscus, the girl overcomes her weakness of not being able to drive by remembering her homeland and drawing strength from it. The author puts this paragraph at the end of the story so you can see that the girl, much like the returning geese and the resilient hibiscus, will also find her way back and bloom again.
144	9006	4	3	I think the author concluded the story with that phrase because it shows she will mature. She is saying that she was not ready for all the challenges she was going to face, as seen in her initial struggles to adapt to the new environment. For example she did not pass her test but instead of crying about it she just said I will take it again next year, displaying resilience. In the story she also longed for her homeland, which she truly missed. She coped with this by buying a winter hibiscus to remind her not only of her homeland but also of her grandmother, who nurtured her love for it. Overall the main character showed depth and maturity throughout the piece, suggesting a hopeful path forward despite the difficulties.
145	9007	4	3	The author concludes the story the way that she does because it shows Saeng’s willingness to adapt to her surroundings, just like the hibiscus. Saeng needs to adapt to her new home in Minnesota, and the hibiscus needs to adapt for the upcoming winter. Saeng vows to herself, “When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding…” We learn from this, you can tell that Saeng has hope for both herself and the hibiscus. Initially, Saeng was very reluctant to accept her home. She says of the hibiscus, “it’s not like the kind we had before.” But she realized that the hibiscus could be a reminder of home as well as a reminder to change for her new home. She knew that if the hibiscus could survive the winter, she could survive living somewhere new, and it's this shared struggle that ultimately gives her strength.
146	9008	4	3	The author concludes this story with the promise Saeng made to herself to take the test again, come springtime, because Saeng is having trouble adapting to her new home, and she won’t give up on fitting in after only one failure. Remembering her home and the life she left behind, knowing she will never be able to return, are painful thoughts for Saeng, but memories of it also help her cope with her loss. The hibiscus and other familiar flowers she found comforted her, because they reminded her of home and provided a small piece of familiarity in an unfamiliar place. At springtime when the geese return and the hibiscus starts blooming, Saeng will feel ready again to take the test, the spring represents the chance for another try, and a new beginning for her in this new land.
147	9009	4	3	The author concludes the story with the last paragraph. The author chose this ending because the sentence informs you Saeng will take the test again. In paragraph @NUM1, Saeng tells her mother she failed the test. So, by the time spring comes around, the hibiscus will start budding, and Saeng will retake the test. Also, the geese left their home temporarily because of the snow. So, she sort of compares herself to the geese because she misses her home. The geese will return when the time is right, just as Saeng will try again, which is what the author concludes in the story’s final paragraph.
148	9010	4	3	I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because the plant represents Saeng's determination to survive. In other words, the hibiscus budding suggests a parallel to Saeng's own budding potential, bringing her good luck for her next driving test after the winter season when the hibiscus blooms again. Also, the reason why the author concluded the sentence is to show Saeng's plan for the future, filled with renewed hope and resilience mirroring the hibiscus's persistence.
149	9011	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. This paragraph shows that Saeng will not give up; she will wait for next time to come around to take the test. It also means she will be well prepared and will have a list of confidence in passing this test. It gives the reader an idea that Saeng will not give up and she will complete the test. Her mother will be proud of her for it, and it shows Saeng will never give up on her dreams. Just like when she said ""let's plant it, right now,"" this example shows that even though Saeng had failed the test and disappointed her mother, she will never give up, and she still has hope in the plant, just like how her mother has hope for Saeng’s future success. This parallel between Saeng's determination and the planting of the hibiscus highlights her resilient spirit."
150	9012	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is talking about when Saeng vowed silently, reflecting on a past connection to her mother and the plants in her garden. Saeng was thinking about the cyclical nature of life, wondering what changes the return of Spring would bring. She pondered how things would be when the snow melts, and with the geese returning, she resolved to face the test again. That is what she vowed silently to herself. Thus, the author concludes by highlighting Saeng's resilience and quiet determination in the face of challenges.
151	9013	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. @PERSON1, a girl, had learned a valuable lesson that day alongside her mother. Despite spending @MONEY1 on melon seeds, much to her mother's initial dismay, their gamble paid off handsomely. Every thing turn on it, like they had egg omlets with bits of melon, a testament to how unexpected joy can blossom from the simplest of seeds, solidifying their bond.
152	9014	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because she wants to show that after everything that happened, Saeng will move on and try hard. For example, when she said, “When they come back in the spring, When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” suggesting renewed determination. By ending the story like this, it leaves the reader with a sense of hope and anticipation, because they do not know if the geese will return, symbolizing an uncertain future. The author seems to be showing the reader that Saeng is starting to adapt to her new country and make it like her old one. For example, when the mother said, “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus,” it illustrates resilience in the face of hardship. This shows that they want their new country to be more like their old one, finding familiar comforts in a new land, and when it is, she will be happy. Therefore, the author concludes this story with this paragraph to show how she will adapt to the change in her environment, embracing change while holding onto hope for the future.
153	9015	4	3	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because she can not wait until spring because her plant will bud and it will remind her of her homeland again. She can not wait to take the test in spring because she would have been able to stay, and she might pass the test in the spring because she did not pass it the first time she took the test. Maybe she concluded the story with this paragraph because she might like the spring and she cannot wait for it to come, signifying a period of renewal and hope.
154	9016	4	3	I believe there is a meaningful reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think that the author will feel more comfortable and ready to take the test. I was able to come to this conclusion because by waiting for winter to be over to take the test again, she is giving herself time to prepare and to mentally regroup. Also, she is waiting for the hibiscus plant to bud. I was able to extract from the fact that she wants to wait for the hibiscus is the presence of comfort; the whole story revolves around how Saeng was able to comfort herself by reminiscing on her past experiences in Vietnam. When she feels that an important part of her life is returning, that she can become comfortable and focused. I think the author would conclude the story with this paragraph is because the author wants to stress the importance of this flower involving how Saeng lives her life, suggesting that her connection to her roots and the promise of renewal will ultimately empower her.
155	9017	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show she has hope. She believes that she can pass the test when everything is back to normal, in the spring, and the disruption of her move has subsided. In the spring the geese will return to the pond, and the hibiscus will be budding in the garden. This makes her feel more at home because it was always like this before she moved, a familiar and comforting cycle. Also she likes the geese and the hibiscus, finding beauty in their presence, and these things might make her feel more comfortable and secure in her new environment. This is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show she has hope, suggesting a return to normalcy will bring renewed confidence.
156	9018	4	3	The author concluded the story with this paragraph he/she wanted to compare Saeng's life with the plant. For example, in the story Saeng had just failed her driving test, and then she saw a plant that reminded her of homeland. From the flower shop to the house, she is comparing her homeland to the flower which shows how she relates to it. So the concluding paragraph shows how when the hibiscus is budding and starts a new phase, she will too and go for her driver's license, drawing strength from the hibiscus's resilience and hopeful bloom to face her own challenges anew.
157	9019	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng's determination to adapt to the change in her life. In the story, Saeng fails her driver's test and is struggling to adapt to her new life in the United States. However, when she sees that the hibiscus and geese are familiar, she is determined to adapt as well. Saeng buys a hibiscus because it reminds her of home, comforting her while simultaneously making her miss her old home more. The hibiscus can survive in both her homeland and the United States, so it helps Saeng realize that she can as well. The author includes the geese because they help Saeng realize that she is becoming more familiar with things in the United States, so she can continue to adapt. Saeng says that she now recognizes the 'V' shape of the geese. Realizing that she is becoming more accustomed to the United States and that she is able to survive helps her reach the determination to retake and pass her driving test, solidifying her resolve to build a life there. The author includes it to summarize the story's theme of adapting to change, showcasing Saeng's journey towards embracing her new environment.
158	9020	4	3	I think that the author put that sentence in to get a little personal with the character, fostering a sense of connection so you can relate to that person and understand their motivations more deeply. This brief glimpse into their inner world helps bridge the gap between reader and character.
159	9021	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the importance of new beginnings and to accentuate the theme in the story. The theme is that one must overcome hardships and seek new beginnings. The springtime is a representation of a new beginning, a chance to shed the past. So, the new beginning of spring will allow her to start all over again on the driver's test, approaching it with renewed hope. Also, the author uses the paragraph to show the symbolic qualities of everyday things; nature holds meaning. Just how the hibiscus reminded her of home life and provided comfort, the geese will remind her of springtime and the promise of a fresh start, reinforcing the story's central theme of resilience.
160	9022	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" the author Minfong Ho concludes the story with that paragraph because it was a way of saying she's going to forget about what happened in the past with her failing her test, accepting it as part of her adjustment to a new culture, and she's going to do better the next time. It's like the author is saying she will be reborn again like the hibiscus, when the spring comes, full of renewed potential. Through the story Saeng had to adjust to a new environment and school system, just like the hibiscus had to adapt to the cold winter. And the hibiscus, blooming unexpectedly in winter, inspired Saeng to do well where she's at and to persevere despite the challenges. So it’s a new beginning for Saeng, after all her learning from the hibiscus, representing hope and resilience in the face of adversity."
161	9023	4	3	It’s kind of like a theme for the story. The hibiscus inspires her to want to do things. I guess it brings memories of her home country and makes her want to try new things. This is significant to the story because it shows you how important the hibiscus was to Saeng, how it connects her to her past, and how it motivates her present actions, ultimately shaping her journey in a new land.
162	9024	4	3	I think the author chose to end the story this way to show that the girl is remembering her past and being at ease. With the flower, she attains a sense of peace, perhaps recalling simpler times or a connection to nature she had forgotten. The writer wants to convey that no matter what you are used to, even after hardship or displacement, you can find something that can bring you happiness and a sense of focus, offering solace and a reminder of beauty in the world. Ultimately, the flower serves as a symbol of hope and the enduring human capacity to find joy in unexpected places.
163	9025	4	3	She is determined to pass that test and is not going to give up until she passes it. She knew the road ahead would be challenging, filled with late nights studying and countless practice problems. But the feeling of almost succeeding, of understanding the concepts just enough to taste victory, fueled her resolve. The library became her second home, the textbooks her constant companions. Each failed attempt only strengthened her will, reinforcing her belief that with enough effort, she would conquer this obstacle and ultimately achieve her goal.
164	9026	4	3	The reason why I feel the author ended the story with this paragraph is because she is showing how the character has matured and how the character grew in her circumstance, demonstrating resilience. This shows that because you failed once doesn’t mean you’re going to fail again, highlighting a crucial lesson in perseverance. Also, it’s okay to feel out of place; there is always going to be a time in life where a new beginning is going to start, so it is your choice to take that chance or be stuck in your own ways, but the decision is always up to you, ultimately emphasizing the character's agency in shaping their future.
165	9027	4	3	"In Minfong Ho's short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" she ends the story by saying, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. ìI-I failed the testî"". As many kids do, Saeng failed her driving test, and she is crucially upset about it. Nobody wants to fail at something, and it is almost a humiliating experience to have failed at a test, knowing that others have already successfully passed. With the quote in the introduction paragraph, it was written as a sign of symbolism. When the geese return back north, it is to show that they are ready to ""start over"" again or to ""try again."" When the hibiscus is budding, it is trying to ""start life"" again. Saeng seeing objects doing things over and over again empowers her to want to succeed and try again, finding strength in nature's cycles. She realizes it is just a part of life and that in order to succeed you have to fail. Minfong concludes with that quote because she understands that no matter what the obstacle, you must press forward and keep trying in order to succeed. She realizes success can only come from hard work and commitment, and that that is what makes a great, strong individual."
166	9028	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the paragraph with that sentence is because he wants to let the reader know that it's not over. He wants the reader to know @ORGANIZATION1 will not forget, suggesting a lingering sense of injustice or a commitment to future action. And also that all this will happen again, implying a cyclical nature to the events described and a warning of impending repetition.
167	9029	4	3	The author concludes the ending as ìI will take that test againî meaning that the things she going through now is going to happen again but next time she will be prepared. Saeng has a very difficult time moving to another country and getting comfortable in the place; the mother supports her as she goes through winter. The hibiscus that she bought is a symbol that represents more than itself; in this text of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho shows this hibiscus that she bought when she was in the worst time. She went through winter with the hibiscus, and at the last paragraph of the story expresses ìwhen the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddingî; she is thinking of the future and how she ìSaeng vowed silently to herself in the spring. She canít wait until winter is over and is just waiting for the spring to come, embodying hope and resilience as she looks forward to a new beginning, suggesting she will face future challenges with renewed strength and determination.
168	9030	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to tell us what she does once she gets back in the spring. That means when she gets back, she will then be taking care of the plants and resuming her gardening. When she gets back she wants the snow to melt and everything to awaken with new life. That is what the author is telling me from the story, showing her anticipation for the return of warmer weather and the chance to nurture her garden once again.
169	9031	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to ensure the reader that she will say again. Also, the author concludes the story this way to show the reader that no matter where you go in life it will always be something and or someone there to assure you of everything. The author also wanted the reader to feel a sense of similarity to the character, meaning no matter how out of place you feel, there's always something you can relate to, offering a comforting sense of connection and shared experience. This reinforces the idea that even in unfamiliar situations, common ground can be found, assuring us that we are not alone in our feelings of displacement.
170	9032	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph so that we buy his coming book, or so that we get more excited. The cliffhanger ending and unresolved questions are clearly designed to pique our interest. By leaving key plot threads dangling, the author hopes to entice us to seek answers in the next installment, thus ensuring a readership eager for the continuation of the narrative.
171	9033	4	3	"In this story the author decides to end the story with this paragraph, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" because she wants to take the test when everything is pleasant, for example, she wants everything she likes in her environment such as the flowers, the geese and the weather. Another reason why I say the author ends the story with that paragraph is because she wants to be in an environment like the one that she was in her home country, for example, there was no snow; it was like springtime all year round. This hopeful image of the return of spring and familiar comforts motivates her to try again, making it a fitting and conclusive end. This is why I say that the author ended the story with that paragraph."
172	9034	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she is comforted by the memories of her homeland and really appreciates the beauty of tropical plants. She believes that since it is winter and the hibiscus is not budding, that cannot pass the test until it is. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. This shows how much she really does believe in the beauty of her homeland and the tropical plants because she is thinking back to other times where things have been strange during the winter and better in the spring and warmer seasons when the plants are budding, so she believes that she will actually pass the drivers test when she feel comfortable, when the plants have budded, indicating her deep connection to the natural cycles of her home and her reliance on them for reassurance.
173	9035	4	3	The geese flying south for the winter and the hibiscus budding are normal things to Saeng. The author wanted to conclude the story with this to show that Saeng felt comfort in things that she was accustomed to. Saeng wanted to have the geese and hibiscus there to feel more comfortable while taking her driving test. Saeng still longs for home and does not quite feel like she fits in the U.S. The hibiscus gives her that comfort feeling like she is home again, in Vietnam. Saeng still feels homesick because she wants things to be how they were. The plants in the greenhouse, along with the disappointment of failing her driving test, bring her to the emotional state that she was in. In the second to last paragraph, the author talks about the feeling of repetition Saeng has when seeing the v formation. Saeng feels that in the winter she will not have the same comfort feeling as when she can see the hibiscus and the geese flying overhead. It says when Saeng arrived in the new country she had nothing that was familiar to her. Now she gets that feeling from the geese and plants. The author concluding by saying Saeng will take her driving test when the winter ends is a good closing because it gives you some insight as to what Saeng is going to do, signifying a hope for a fresh start and renewed comfort in familiar signs of home when spring arrives.
174	9036	4	3	"I think the author concludes the sentence then they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"" is that because it was winter and the school was likely closed. When the geese come back it will be spring, and with the thaw and the hibiscus budding, it will be time to go back to school, making it a fitting time for Saeng to retake the test."
175	9037	4	3	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes his story with an odd ending. “’when they come back,’ Saeng vowed silently to herself, ‘in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding. then I will take that test again.’” I believe that beyond the literal meaning the author is showing how Saeng is adapting to the new country. By failing her driver’s test she also failed in adapting and accepting the new country. This failure represents her struggle to navigate a new culture and its requirements. By vowing to try again it also shows that she is willing to give the country another chance. It signifies a renewed commitment to integration, a willingness to learn and overcome challenges. “She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home…” I believe that this is showing that she still didn’t consider this country her home. She was still stuck on her past, her roots. The hibiscus, a symbol of hope and resilience, blooming in the winter, mirrors Saeng's own potential to flourish in this new land, suggesting that she will eventually embrace her new home and find her place within it.
176	9038	4	3	The author concludes this story in the paragraph to show that Saeng won't stop, just because she failed the first time. The setback with her initial attempt only fuels her determination. It also shows that she is not going to let certain things keep her down, highlighting her resilience and unwavering spirit in the face of obstacles. This ending emphasizes her persistent nature and implies future successes despite current challenges.
177	9039	4	3	The last sentence of a story is usually the most meaningful. I believe the author ended the story this way for many reasons. For example, I think the author did this to leave the reader with a strong sense of determination. The story quotes, ìI will take that test again.î By use of the word will, the author shows the girl's determination. She didnít say she would try to, she said she will, without a doubt implying a firm resolve. I also think the author ended this way to emphasize the theme of new beginnings. The story quotes, ìwhen they come back... in the spring... I will take that test again.î This shows that in spring, the new beginning of life, she will take the test, linking her renewed effort with the season of rebirth and hope. This is why I believe the author ended the story this way, effectively solidifying the themes of perseverance and fresh starts in the reader's mind.
178	9040	4	3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” made a good choice to conclude the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This paragraph hints to the reader that Saeng intends to combine her new and old lives. Her old life is represented by the hibiscus; she used to the constants from back home, like the familiar plant. The geese symbolize her new life; they have become “almost familiar to her now,” a part of her present reality. The obstacle she faces is passing the driving test, a symbol of independence and integration into her new environment. The author implies that in the spring, when the old and new parts of Saeng’s life are combined, Saeng will be able to overcome her “obstacle,” and all will be well. With the geese in the ground, symbolizing her settled new life alongside the blooming hibiscus, Saeng’s life will have come full circle, suggesting a harmonious blend of her past and present, ultimately leading to her success.
179	9041	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it's important when she says when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding; these are markers of time and change. Then she says she will take that test again, to tell the reader when she anticipates a renewed sense of readiness. That's why it's in the story, to indicate a future point determined by the cyclical nature of seasons and personal growth when she feels prepared to face that challenge again.
180	9042	4	3	In the story ìWinter Hibiscusî by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it emphasizes that Saeng is willing to retake the test when it comes back, showcasing her resilience. I also think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the story the second to last paragraph says, ìAlmost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of the season upon season, almost familiar to her now.î This sentence shows me that Saeng is slowly getting used to the new place, indicating a significant shift in her perspective. Also how she is changing her mind about the plant and the fact that even though it's not the same, it can still have meaning for her. Therefore, I think the author made a good choice in ending the story with this paragraph, as it effectively encapsulates Saeng's evolving acceptance and adaptation to her new environment.
181	9043	4	3	The last paragraph states ìin the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.î I believe the author has ended with that paragraph to state the fact when her new home is like her old home maybe she will feel more confident and more in her place, instead of cold winter total opposite of where she use to live. The blooming hibiscus, the return of geese, and the melting snow all symbolize a return to life and familiarity. The feeling of her old home, in her new home will make her more positive and comfortable. So then she will take the test feeling at home and pass. She anticipates a sense of belonging and renewed optimism, leading to success.
182	9044	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author expresses how Saeng believes in the power of her memories, and only when she changes and adapts to the culture will she have the courage to retake the test she failed. Saeng misses her home and struggles to see similarities between her new and old lives. ""She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" Saeng, initially resistant to the move, begins to embrace new experiences while cherishing old memories. At first, everything felt foreign, but now she is starting to find comfort in her new surroundings. ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again."" The ending paragraph, reflecting Saeng's changing feelings, offers hope for her new life. She gradually gains confidence, knowing that with it, she can retake her test and succeed. The author illustrates the positive potential of change through adaptation. While life may not always be perfect, courage can create a happy home filled with both new and cherished old memories, as Saeng begins to realize in the final paragraph."
183	9045	4	3	The authour meerly states the obvious within this story of shortness. This exerpt mainly means that when spring arrives she will return to the Green house or area with all the plants. When she gets there, the girll will atempt to act the plant that grews wild in her home country and bring it to her new home. This simple act symbolizes her yearning for connection to her roots and a desire to recreate a piece of her past in her present.
184	9046	4	3	The reason the author concludes the story with that kind of paragraph, I think heís trying to show Saeng as the type of person to not give up and always to keep growing just like the hibiscus plant. And because she realizes that most of the things that she thought as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her. Saeng notices that she will still have next season when the plant has grown and the geese fly into a distinctive V again, suggesting a cyclical renewal and her own potential for continued personal development alongside the natural world, solidifying the theme of resilience.
185	9047	4	3	"Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph because to show how Saeng feels. In the paragraph, Saeng said ""I will take that test again,"" which signifies her determination to persevere. It doesn't necessarily mean going through the *exact* same experiences, but rather facing similar challenges with renewed resolve. Her statement suggests a commitment to learning and improving, indicating a willingness to confront obstacles and ultimately succeed. This demonstrates Saeng's growth and resilience, showing that she will continue striving despite setbacks."
186	9048	4	3	The author ends the story this way to show that there can always be a happy ending. The geese came back, their familiar honking filling the air once more, and the girl was happy because of it, her heart soaring with a joy she thought she had lost forever. The return symbolized hope and the cyclical nature of life, suggesting that even after periods of loss and sadness, renewal is possible.
187	9049	4	3	The author concluded the story with his paragraph because these are all things that she isnt going to give up on. She is trying to say that when everything she believes in successed thats when she is going to take her driving test. Her mother says that the flower is never going ti give up and itís strong enough to live through the winter. The geese are going to always come back. That is exactly what she is going to do with her test. She is not going to give up on the test, she is going to keep trying untill she passes, mirroring the flower's resilience and the geese's unwavering return. This symbolizes her determination to persevere and ultimately achieve her goal.
188	9050	4	3	Saeng feels more comfortable in the spring because it reminds her of home, a place where the chill of winter was unknown. She probably never experienced snow or winter before, so the stark landscape and biting winds offer no familiar comfort. Nothing in this time of year reminds her of home. In the spring, however, it does; the geese return, their honking calls echoing a familiar melody, and the hibiscus, with their vibrant blooms, grow again. These sights and sounds make everything feel like its her home again. Confidence is what she receives when spring comes again, a renewed sense of belonging that strengthens her spirit and allows her to thrive.
189	9051	4	3	"The author concludes the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" with that paragraph because it sums up everything the hibiscus has given Saeng for strength and courage. Just like the hibiscus, Saeng felt out of place in this new country, and the hibiscus helps her realize the importance in adapting to her survival in order to live happily. She can’t always be dwelling in the past but learn to like where she lives now. Therefore, when the author writes, ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" it is a direct symbol of Saeng budding or opening her mind to the new ways, like learning to drive, and embracing her new life with renewed hope."
190	9052	4	3	I believe the author of “Winter Hibiscus” used this for the last paragraph because it is saying when she sees that hibiscus it will give her memories of home again, memories that will bring encouragement for the test. The geese symbolize Saeng's determination to pass the test and try in the new country. Saeng explains, “she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the dusk.” This quote creates a vivid image that lets me know Saeng will take the test when she has encouragement from not only the geese but also the hibiscus, ultimately showing her resolve.
191	9053	4	3	The author concludes with that paragraph because it is in a way letting you know that everything’s going to be alright. Saeng is going to retry her driver's test again, showing resilience, and everything is back to the way she likes best, offering a sense of comfort. It gives you a sense of hope that everything is going to be alright with her and her future endeavors. Also, that she is going to start making the best out of life, embracing new opportunities and challenges with a positive attitude. I believe it's saying that everything will work out eventually, which is why I think the author concludes with that paragraph, leaving the reader with a feeling of optimism.
192	9054	4	3	The Author uses this paragraph to **END** the Story because it shows how Saeng wants to adapt to this country and she is allready beging to understand it and like it. When it **says** ìand this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test againî It is a metaphor about herself when the **hibiscus** begins to bloom and **grow**, just as she is starting to bloom and **grow**. This is why the Author endeded with this passage, to show Saeng’s hope and budding potential.
193	9055	4	3	Saeng said that when the tree she bought starts budding she will take the test over. She means that without that plant she just does not feel like taking the test. She does not because the plant was with her, her whole life, almost like a good luck charm. She also thinks that she can not do it, without that plant, feeling its presence is necessary for her success. Saeng means that since she’s had a plant like that her whole life then she thinks she needs it for the test, but I don’t think she really needs it. I guess it just “comforts” her, providing a sense of familiarity and security that helps ease her anxiety. Ultimately, while the plant offers her psychological support, her ability to pass the test lies within her own knowledge and skills.
194	9056	4	3	The author didn't think that Saeng was ready to take the test until she knew more about it. Saeng had a lot on her mind, especially thoughts of gardening, since she didn't have any friends in school and didn't want to go there because she would have nobody to talk to. It's good that Saeng vowed to take the test, because she will never know if she would do good or bad otherwise. So, the author realized that Saeng will take the test and, with her determination, likely pass it.
195	9057	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memories of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring. This is due to the fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautiful for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country, allowing her to feel more connected to her past as she navigates her present.
196	9058	4	3	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the story in a unique way that demonstrates a will to survive. For example, the author writes and explains how the plants ""dok faeng-noi"" have adapted to their cold environment, differently from those back home. This demonstrates the idea of survival because the plant migrated to a place that seemed warm but later faced cold conditions; it found ways to change and adapt, driven by the instinct to survive. Specifically, the text notes how the plant learned to bloom even in the harsh winter, a clear example of adaptation. Another example in the text is Saeng telling herself that in the spring she will try and take the test again. This demonstrates the will to survive because when Saeng failed the test, she felt melancholy and failure. The fact that she has the courage to prepare for the test in spring shows how a human being wants to live, and for her to live in a new country, she must adapt by passing that test, ultimately becoming a survivor, determined to build a new life despite the initial setback. Through both the plant's adaptation and Saeng's determination, Ho underscores the profound human and natural drive to persevere and flourish."
197	9059	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the story about snows on the roads. He shows people how to watch where they are going, focusing on the treacherous conditions. In conclusion, the paragraph shows he made it through the snowstorm, finally arriving at his destination, safe but mindful of the journey's dangers.
198	9060	4	3	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng vows to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding, ""then I will take the test again."" The author concludes with this paragraph because the hibiscus brings her comfort from home and confidence. “Almost familiar to her now,” this quote from the story shows that things are starting to be right and she is starting to feel comforted by making her realize that where she is living now can be similar to where she used to live. When around the hibiscus it brings back memories of the flowers that they used to have where they lived. Both the mother and the daughter appreciate the flower they found because it is similar to what they had back home. For example, in the story the mother says, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” This shows that they appreciate its similarity to the old hibiscus. In conclusion, the author concludes this story with that paragraph because it helps readers to understand the importance of the girl's memory of where she used to live, suggesting that home can be found and rebuilt even in new and unfamiliar places."
199	9061	4	3	"The author chose this end to show that Saeng hasn't given up on how she is living yet. It shows that even though she really loved her hometown, and feels and remembers a lot back then, she is still willing to persevere. She had taken the test and failed; living where she was living then just seemed like too much pressure on her. Although she hasn't quite adapted thoroughly, she will try her best to overcome situations that are brought upon her. It gives the reader hope by ending the story like this, instead of just leaving the reader at she bought a flower after failing a test and moves on with her life. For example, when she failed the test she seemed distressed and very angry. ""I-I-I failed the test,"" Saeng said. ""For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shedding it to bits."" It angered Saeng how she had to leave her happy past life for one that is different and challenging, but she is willing to make the best of it. When faced with a challenge, extreme emotional situations occur. Saeng just needed hope, and the author chose this to portray to the reader that there is a chance of hope, a chance for a brighter future despite current difficulties."
200	9062	4	3	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho ends the story as she does to highlight the complex emotions and shifting perspectives of Saeng, the young protagonist adjusting to a new life in America. The open-ended conclusion, where Saeng contemplates the winter hibiscus, allows readers to ponder the ongoing negotiation of identity and belonging. It is a symbol of resilience and adaptation in an unfamiliar environment. The author leaves us with a sense of hope. The author's ending choices effectively underscore the nuanced process of cultural assimilation and the enduring power of heritage, leaving the reader to contemplate Saeng's journey."
201	9063	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it wraps it all up and sums it into one. It is explaining that she is looking forward to the spring when the hibiscus is blooming again, symbolizing a renewed sense of hope and beauty after a period of difficulty.
202	9064	4	3	"The reason why at the end of the story she ended it with ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the shows melt & the gees return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the againî"" is because shes making the statement that the birds have where they live all the time & the plant can live here & not when she has & still live shes saying she can to if she tries so she will wait till birds came back are ok the plant buds living in her new home so everything will be okey then she will be able to take the test because she understand & believe she will feel safer & a lot better. She sees the resilience of nature as a reflection of her own potential for adaptation and growth in a new environment. The return of the birds and the blossoming of the hibiscus symbolize hope and the promise of a fresh start, reinforcing her belief that she too can flourish. Thus, she will feel safer and more confident when the time comes to face the test again."
203	9065	4	3	The story ended like this for my reasons. First of all, he ended the story to make the readers think about what will happen next, pondering the possibilities and outcomes if there is a part two. Secondly, it leaves the option open so he can make a part two should he choose to. That is why he ended the story like that, providing a cliffhanger and planting the seeds for a potential continuation.
204	9066	4	3	She vowed this because just as the geese would return she shall, also as they test themselves to learn and grow she would. Furthermore she **embraced** the test of love, survival, and family tradition, she would know that coming back was destiny. In example, they come to raise their young for the journey that they shall face and help them to realise that they always will come back because their lives started there and to always escape cold and mankind that wants to harm their lives. The winter months are very harsh there so they know that they have to leave just to **survive**. She learns the lessons of family, freedom, life, and survival, solidifying her resolve to return, just as the geese do, guided by instinct and a deep connection to her origins.
205	9067	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he made a commitment to himself of taking the test all over again. He probably said that because there’s always a next time for everything. Mostly, the reason he said it was to remind himself that there's always another try at everything, offering a sense of hope and renewed determination. Finally, that most people should know that everyone gets a second chance, reinforcing the idea of resilience and the opportunity for improvement.
206	9068	4	3	The author concludes the story like this because the seasons are changing and there finishing their cycle and starting a new one, suggesting a sense of renewal. Thus, I think this is a good way to end a story like this because it kinda sets a mood and a feel at the end of the story, offering a reflective and perhaps hopeful tone as the narrative concludes.
207	9069	4	3	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with this paragraph because it conveys the theme of the story, adjusting to changes in life. So many things have changed for Saeng and she hasn’t fully adjusted yet to the way of life. Yet she learns that she needs to be determined to adapt and survive like the hibiscus. The text states, “In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding” The hibiscus teaches Saeng to never give up, like the hibiscus doesn’t give up and survives during the winter. She learns to be determined and even though she failed the test the first time, her memories have helped her and she is going to go for it again. These ideas are in the last paragraph because they summarize the idea of not giving up even if you feel out of place, highlighting her resilience. She has slowly gotten used to this new place and recognizes the seasons now as she thinks this last thought, signifying her growing acceptance and adaptation.
208	9070	4	3	To set a tone and to talk about how they look. That little paragraph can also start another book or get you into studying things. It could also compare your life with the geese's life, explaining hardships you went through. In doing so, a narrative bridge is built, inviting reflection on shared struggles and resilience, perhaps even sparking a deeper interest in ornithology or inspiring a new literary work based on these observations. This offers a lens through which we can appreciate their beauty and draw parallels to our own journeys.
209	9071	4	3	The author chooses to end this story like this for many reasons. Throughout the story, the author gives you hints of Saeng being homesick, missing her familiar surroundings and the comfort of her culture. He relates this to the flower, a symbol of resilience, being strong enough to survive the winter months, suggesting that Saeng, too, will survive this difficult period of adjustment. Although the flower isn’t the same as she had at home, representing the changes in Saeng's life and environment, change is inevitable, and at least she can hold on to that small piece of home. So I believe the author decides to end the story with this image of hope and perseverance, to say just like the plant, she’ll survive and try to adjust in the spring, blossoming in her new environment, also like her driving test, she will learn and hopefully succeed, demonstrating her ability to adapt and thrive.
210	9072	4	3	The author concluded like that because he was the one to score the lines below what you write, assigning a score of level and key better. He was surprised to kindly be separated by for there by up so blese, giving one a high score of will sweit all at you up to the end; therefore, the author concludes.
211	9073	4	3	"I believe that the author included this paragraph to show that she didn't give up, to show that she kept trying after she failed. Saeng said to her mother ""I failed the test,"" revealing an initial setback. This detail is important because it highlights her resilience and determination to persevere. The inclusion of this scene makes her sound proud and happy to try the test over again, demonstrating a positive attitude toward challenges. The text shows how determined she was going to sound when faced with another opportunity. Thus, the author uses this moment to portray Saeng as someone who embraces challenges and is willing to learn from her mistakes."
212	9074	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it lets the reader know that there is still a chance for Saeng; she is not giving up on herself or the test. While reading you will find that Saeng is comforted by memories of her homeland, and obviously this move to another country was hard on her. In the story the author writes, ìIt felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center- just as she had known it would feel.î The feeling and scent of the hibiscus flower comforted her, reminding her of home. She then proceeded to purchase the plant, because she failed the test she needed something to lift her spirits back up once again. The author decided to end the story with Saeng stating that once ìthis hibiscus plant is budding,then l will take that test againî because as the reader should have learned by now, the hibiscus plant has been the only positive aspect in her life since the move, a tangible connection to her past. It is giving her motivation to once again take the driverís test, and it is also letting the reader know that Saeng is not giving up hope for her future in this new place.
213	9075	4	3	Minfong Ho concluded the story ìWinter Hibiscusî with a strong paragraph to show the passion and will of Saeng in her new home to complete the test. When the closing sentences states that Saeng ìvowedî to pass the test, it shows her determination to fight, showcasing resilience in the face of a challenging new environment. This will could be from the memories of her grandmother and the flowers that reminded her so closely of her old home, fueling her resolve. Saengs courage to face her homesickness is the seed of the story, and by ending it with such a bold statement, Minfong Ho blooms this seemingly sad tale into a story of willpower and drive to pass her test. ìWinter Hibiscusî is a passage of heartache, despair, and yerning for a past life. By closing the story with the uplifting promise from Saeng, Minfong Ho puts a happy ending to a possibly sad tale.
214	9076	4	3	The author concludes the story with this because the season is ending and also the story is ending, mirroring each other in their respective conclusions. Just as the vibrant colors of autumn fade into the starkness of winter, the narrative arc reaches its natural resolution. The falling leaves symbolize not only the end of the growing season but also the culmination of the events and relationships explored within the story. The characters, like the landscape around them, have undergone a transformation, and the ending provides a sense of closure, fittingly aligning with the seasonal shift.
215	9077	4	3	The author concludes the story with this type of paragraph because the author knows it’s bound to happen again. I know this because in that paragraph it says “in the spring…I will take this test again”. She is just preparing herself for next year, understanding the cyclical nature of her experience. This anticipation of a repeat performance, tinged with resignation and perhaps a touch of resolve, is why I think this paragraph ended the story, encapsulating the ongoing challenge she faces.
216	9078	4	3	Saeng was thinking to herself after dinner about the test. She knew that she could do much better than before, now understanding her past mistakes. And she made a vow to herself, a silent promise, saying that once winter finally ends and spring starts, she would take the test again, and this time she will pass it with flying colors, proving to herself what she is truly capable of.
217	9079	4	3	Saeng wants to take the test again when it is beautiful out and the hibiscus is budding. The plant shows the beautiful achievement of passing the test. The plant will help her pass the test by being strong, tough, and nicely finished. These characteristics represent the girl and the flower. The day was a good day and she wants to take the test on the same day. The plant was strong and tough. This represents the girl in that time she didn’t pass. She told her mother, who was very understanding about it. The plant represents beautiful things, and the geese represent beautiful things as well. The girl wants to do that on that time of day and thinks she will get it next time. When she completes and passes her test, she wants to come home to the beautiful surroundings to remember that day. The author concluded with that statement to represent the importance of the plant and the surroundings when she wants to pass the test, highlighting how these elements serve as a source of inspiration and a reminder of her resilience.
218	9080	4	3	"The author might have concluded the story with that paragraph, because she wanted to remind the reader how sincere ""Saeng"" was to the hibiscus flower. I say this because throughout the story @PERSON1 was very compassionate about the flower. I think she felt as though she could relate to the flower, and ending on that note emphasizes the deep connection and empathy she felt."
219	9081	4	3	The author ends with this paragraph because it symbolizes a new beginning. Saeng says, “I failed the test.” She is also really sad, but she is making a commitment to get a fresh start on life, just like how the world does every spring with renewed hope. The theme of the story is when life seems hard, take a new approach. She intends to retake the drivers test, viewing it as a chance to learn from her mistakes and try again, embodying the spirit of resilience and fresh starts.
220	9082	4	3	The author concludes the story with this to show that Saeng will be ready to take the test in time, but not before a period of adjustment. She first has to grow and adapt to the new surroundings, embracing her new life. Just like the hibiscus flower, uprooted from the familiar store and now planted outside, must adapt to its new environment to thrive. The geese are adapting to the surroundings by flying south for the winter, instinctively responding to the changing seasons. Saeng needs to still learn more and adapt before she can pass her driver's test, both practically and mentally. By ending the story with this paragraph, it shows that Saeng realizes what she needs to do. She needs to stop dwelling on where she used to live and begin her new life in a new country, embracing the challenges and opportunities it presents.
221	9083	4	3	"Minfong Ho ended her story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with an optimistic sentence. She concluded it this way because the main character of the story was beginning to lose hope. Saeng decided to retake the driving test when her hibiscus flower was blooming. This flower reminds her of her past life in Vietnam with her grandmother. ""Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb"". She preferred her life in Vietnam than hers in America. She was going to wait until ""this hibiscus is budding,"" so she can feel more comfortable and happy, drawing strength from the familiar comfort the flower provided. The author wanted to end it so Saeng would be happy, suggesting a hopeful future where she finds her place and rediscovers joy."
222	9084	4	3	"The author ended the story with that because she is sad and she wants to give hope to the reader that you should never give up on anything, always keep trying. Also it ends on a good note; if it was like ""I stayed up in my room crying"" that would not be a good ending. This ending gives hope to the reader and it also tells the reader to practice. This is because when spring comes around, the lady is going to practice driving so when she takes the test she won't fail. Also, the girl is getting happier at the end and that makes the reader happy. So in conclusion, that ending for the story was a good choice for many reasons, like making the reader happy, giving the reader courage to never give up, and to practice something if you fail it the first time; it also encourages readers to help their mother when she is planting or digging up plants, ultimately offering a message of perseverance and familial support."
223	9085	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to develop the theme and to project what the main character will do after she plants the hibiscus, I believe that the theme of this story is adjusting to changes in life and the author builds upon this theme in the final paragraph. In the ending paragraph, the author writes, ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î The author demonstrates how Saeng learns to adjust when things change in her life. In this instance, Saeng fails her driverís test and to deal with this setback, she buys a hibiscus to remind her of her homeland. The hibiscus symbolizes a new start, and Saeng plans to retake the test once the geese return, highlighting her resilience and adaptation to a new environment.
224	9086	4	3	So she did not forget to take the test again, having carefully marked it on her calendar this time.
225	9087	4	3	Saeng did not give up on herself. She said she would take it over again then she might pass it, showing resilience. You will not always pass on your first try it takes a while sometime, and that's perfectly normal. Saeng encourage you to never to give up just cause you did not get it on your first time; persistence is key. She also builds confidence in herself, believing in her ability to succeed eventually. That's why the author concluded the story that way, highlighting the importance of self-belief and perseverance in the face of setbacks.
226	9088	4	3	The author ended the story with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test in the spring, because he wanted to show that the geese and the hibiscus plant represent a sort of rebirth or revival to Saeng. He wanted to end the story on a positive note. Spring is an archetypal season. It is a season of birth and growing. Saeng saw the hibiscus after she failed the first test. It took her to her memories back in Vietnam, which comforted her. She believes that maybe when she sees the plant flourishing and the geese returning, she will experience that same revival again, feeling a renewed sense of hope and determination to succeed in her endeavors.
227	9089	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the last paragraph because Saeng failed the test at the beginning of the story. After going through the plants and learned new things, it is natural for Saeng to take the test again in the spring(end of the story). I think this because Saeng learned that she has to get used to being in America and the plant reminded her that she had to adapt when she saw the geese fly in the ""V"" formation; it was the same as back at home in Vietnam. She realized that life in America wasn't so different from Vietnam and she has to take that driver's test again in order to get used to living in America with all of its changes. I also think that it's proper to end the story with her taking the driver's test in spring because the geese will come back, and the hibiscus is budding, signifying a fresh start. This is a beginning for them as well as Saeng, suggesting renewed hope and adaptation in her new environment."
228	9090	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph showing that Saeng is willing to try again to get a plant that will remind her of her grandmother and remind her of her old home, where she might go back one day. So, she can see the near flower she loves and not the taken one, demonstrating her hope for the future and a connection to her past.
229	9091	4	3	In ìWinter Hibiscusî the author concludes the story the way he does to show that Saeng isnít giving up. In the spring she will see the plant and remember her home which will help her not feel as homesick. ìPlants she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood work.î This quote shows that when she sees familiar plants she is reminded of home, so in the spring when her plant blooms she will see it and feel more comforting and more at home, mitigating her feelings of displacement, which will help her find the strength to pass the driving test. So as the plant blooms, so does her comfort level, offering her a renewed sense of hope and resilience as she navigates her new life.
230	9092	4	3	What l think the author was talking about was snow, and it was added outside for the bay's matter, and the snow started to melt. The melting snow suggests a change in weather, perhaps a transition from winter to spring, concluding that the author used the detail of melting snow to subtly indicate a shift in the environment.
231	9093	4	3	He concluded the story with that sentence because it told that she learned a lesson in life. All the way back home, where she originally came from, she missed her friends and seeing her mother work out in the garden during this time of year when it's cold; I bet they're poor in one way. In conclusion, the author chose this sentence because it sounds like she learned a lesson in life and is even starting all over again, but with a better understanding born from her experience.
232	9094	4	3	Saeng says this in the paragraph because she wants to make her mother proud of her, especially after her initial disappointment with the test results. Therefore, she is going to take the test again after winter, hoping to demonstrate her dedication and improved understanding of the material.
233	9095	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is more about will power, because she loves the hibiscus, and what other way to end the story than by having her compare herself to the hibiscus? When she says, ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" she is saying the snow is slowing down the hibiscus, just as the failure is slowing her down. She is going to be reading to prepare, so that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding, she, too, will be budding by passing her test, thus showing her resilience."
234	9096	4	3	"In the article the author concludes the story with Saeng vowing to herself that ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because the spring and the hibiscus reminds her of home. For example in the article she gets shaky because she cant say home because she misses it too much. So she finds things that reminds her of it like a plant called dok faeng-noi. It’s not the real plant but she gets it to remind her where she comes from. In conclusion, Saeng finds a plant, she likes the spring because it reminds her home. How about what reminds you of home? Think about it."
235	9097	4	3	The reason that the author chose to end this story with this paragraph is to tell the reader that things get better as time goes on. Saeng failed the driverís test because she wasnt ready, lacking the necessary experience. The flower bloomed before it was ready and similarly withered. The author is saying you need to be patient and good things will come your way, suggesting that proper timing and preparation are crucial for success and lasting fulfillment.
236	9098	4	3	"The author chose to conclude the paragraph with the sentence ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring , when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because it shows how the strength of the hibiscus is related to Saeng's strength. In the story, after failing her driver's test, Saeng finds comfort in a hibiscus native to her country. When she gets home her mother says ""I've seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This shows that Saeng is faltering in her new foreign country. The end quote sums up that Saeng finds strength in the strength of the flowers, almost thinking ""if the flower can survive in a land away from its home, why can't I?"" The hibiscus, enduring a harsh climate far from its origin, becomes a symbol of resilience for Saeng, solidifying her resolve to persevere and try again."
237	9099	4	3	When she is ready and good she is saying she will take the test again. When she is ready and good and it is nice and beautiful out then she will have the confidence to take the test again, suggesting external factors also play a role in her readiness. The author was trying to tell us how she felt about letting her mom down, hinting at the pressure and disappointment she experienced. This feeling is compounded by her own internal assessment of her preparedness and the ideal conditions needed to succeed.
238	9100	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it's important to the story and closes it up. It's exploring that the girl is starting to adjust to the new area and is going to try harder to get along well there. So by saying she's going to take the test again, it means she's going to look at it in a new way. The author put this at the end to make sense of everything and show the girl had changed, demonstrating her willingness to adapt and integrate into her new environment.
239	9101	4	3	In the short story ìWinter hibiscusî The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author felt as though Saeng would be ready to take the test at that particular time. The preceding events, including her dedicated study and growing confidence, pointed towards this readiness. She had diligently absorbed the material, and her understanding of the concepts had deepened significantly. The author, observing her progress and newfound self-assurance, understood that Saeng had reached a point where putting her knowledge to the test would be both beneficial and potentially successful, thus solidifying the decision to conclude the narrative at this juncture of preparedness.
240	9102	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it's showing she still has hope. The image of the hibiscus, despite its challenges, blooming again symbolizes resilience and new beginnings, giving her hope and strength. In the spring, mirroring the hibiscus's rebirth, she will take her test again and will hope to pass it, carrying the hibiscus's strength with her. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism for her future endeavors.
241	9103	4	3	"In the last paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes by saying ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". I think the author concludes with this quote because it shows her determination to overcome this obstacle. For Saeng, the hibiscus represents comfort and the ability to overcome the challenges of her new life in America, reminding her of home. Saeng is very strong, and she believes in that determination, which comes from her past experiences of adapting to new environments. The author concluded with that because it ultimately showcases Saeng’s resolve and budding hope for the future."
242	9104	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author ends the story in that paragraph to show how meaningful that flower is to Saeng. The text stated, ""In the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the 'winter hibiscus' into it."" This shows the reader that it is very meaningful to Saeng to have this plant in her garden. Also, by having that conclusion statement it helps the reader understand the affection for her new country. It symbolizes her growing roots in a new land. Also, the conclusion paragraph shows comfort at a time of disappointment. In the story it said, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus."" This also shows the connection of Saeng and the flower and how it helps her through everything, representing her resilience and ability to adapt to a new environment. Ultimately, the winter hibiscus becomes a symbol of hope and perseverance for Saeng."
243	9105	4	3	Why I think she added this is because she needs time to grow like the plant before she takes the test again. Sometimes you need more time to pass your test, and that's okay. Going through school teaches more than stuff we need to know; it helps us grow up and understand life. I know myself as a tenth grader that I understand life more than I did in first. She still has a lot of growing mentally about her past and present, and that will take time, but it's a necessary step for her future success.
244	9106	4	3	"I believe that the author ended the story with this line to show that hope for the girl was still there and that even perhaps the flower had inspired her a lot. I believe that when she says ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"", She specifically chose this time for her to start over, and try again just as everything else mentioned is. When it says, ""and this hibiscus is budding"", it shows that the flower is blooming again, with a fresh start and beginning again just as she would try to do when she tries again to succeed at passing the test she must pass. It’s a period of renewal, mirroring her own desire for a fresh start. Also, the tone with which she said this showed hope; she was hopeful and determined that next time around she would certainly pass. This connection between the natural cycle of rebirth and her own aspirations clearly suggests that she finds strength and motivation in the resilience of nature, reinforcing the idea that she, too, can overcome her challenges."
245	9107	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that while this particular tale is over, Saeng's life will continue. The paragraph provides closure for the reader as well as explains that in time Saeng will take the test again, once she has further adapted to American culture. This ending suggests that her journey of assimilation is ongoing, and although she faced setbacks in this instance, her determination remains. Her future attempts will be informed by her experiences, signaling a hopeful outlook for her integration.
246	9108	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because wants her to be successful and do good. It’s a final, hopeful wish for the protagonist's future. The author sees potential in her, a chance to rise above her circumstances and make a positive impact on the world around her. This concluding sentiment reinforces the underlying theme of hope and the possibility of redemption, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism about the protagonist's journey.
247	9109	4	3	The response explains that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story centers on a plant's annual return around the same time each year. The paragraph likely signifies, in my interpretation, that with the plant's return in spring and the geese reappearing, it represents another challenge for the plant to thrive and endure, avoiding death.
248	9110	4	3	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph, showcasing Saeng's silent vow, emphasizes her unwavering determination. The hibiscus, reminiscent of the plant from ""home,"" represents her comfort and, more importantly, symbolizes her resolve in navigating her new life. The phrase ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now"" suggests Saeng's reflection on recognizing the geese, a moment that bolsters her self-assurance. The simile, ""like the Geese she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive v was etched,"" illustrates the enduring presence of hope within her. This final paragraph effectively ties together Saeng's newfound hope and beliefs, solidifying her commitment to persevering in her unfamiliar surroundings."
249	9111	4	3	Saeng vows this to herself at the end of the story to show that she will adapt to this change, just like the hibiscus will bud. She knows that it will be hard and take time, but in the end she will achieve approval and happiness. We see that it is already hard for her by the way she breaks down crying and the strained conversations she has with her mother, revealing the emotional toll of her new circumstances. She symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things are going to get better if she is not too stuck in the past, embracing the future with hope and resilience.
250	9112	4	3	The author concludes the paragraph with a statement that Saeng said, a very good statement. The author ended with this to show that she is motivated and determined to do this. She shows she is motivated in many ways. She says, “Here let me help you mother.” This shows that she is motivated by helping her mother finish what she started. She is also determined by saying, “almost reluctantly she realizes that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through a quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar now.” This shows that she wants to do something and she doesn’t think it is weird anymore, highlighting her acceptance and resolve. That is why the author concludes with that statement, emphasizing Saeng's shift in perspective and renewed commitment.
251	9113	4	3	The Author concludes the story with this When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is building then I will take that test again! because he or she are the ones who wrote the story. One information is her family moved to the united @ORGANIZATION1 from Vietnam. Second one is the Author could of made this story it was about her. Saeng fails her driving test. This experience, so soon after her family's move from Vietnam to the united @ORGANIZATION1, was disheartening. When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is building then I will take that test again!
252	9114	4	3	The author concludes ìWinter Hibiscusî with that paragraph to show the narrator realizes that even though sheís in a new country, some things are still the same, so she becomes determined to pass the test. For example, the narrator said, ìshe realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quick repetition of season upon season, familiar to her now.î This quote shows that the narrator has realized that even though aspects of how life has changed, some things remain the same. This also shows that some things, like the test, were strange to her, but now that she is familiar with it, she could pass it. The narrator also said, ìSaeng did not dare look at her mother in her eyes.î This quote shows that the narrator was disappointed with herself for not passing the test. This means that the test was very important to her with the added pressure to pass, and in spite of a new environment, she is ready to pass the test, but sheíll be more prepared next time. The theme of this story could be seen as overcoming things that discourage you. The narrator has gone through many changes recently, but finds consistency in the repetition of the seasons. This realization fuels her determination, demonstrating that familiarity and perseverance can help overcome challenges, even in a new land.
253	9115	4	3	The author shows a willingness to try harder in this story. She states that, ìIn the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î I think the author realizes that she is going to have to adapt. Also, saying that she will wait till the spring, means she is going to try again, and not give up, showing determination in the face of challenges. The author has a sentimental value to the hibiscus since she is waiting for the hibiscus to bud; I believe she is referring that hibiscus to her country. Since she has left her country, the hibiscus is the closest thing she has to it, and therefore, she will wait with the flower, drawing strength and inspiration from its growth as she prepares to face the test again. This connection to her homeland fuels her resolve to persevere.
254	9116	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng now thinks about images associated with memories in her new home, as well as images she remembers from Vietnam. At the beginning of the story, in the floral shop, she remembers her grandmother, as well as a well, a hibiscus hedge, and other things that remind her of certain feelings and experiences. At the end of the story, she uses both the hibiscus, which reminds her of her previous home and the feelings of nostalgia and longing, and the Canadian geese, which initially seemed foreign but now don't seem so unfamiliar to her anymore, to represent the passing of time and her growing acceptance. She now sees her new home as having familiar things in it attached to memories, just as her old home did, suggesting a sense of belonging is beginning to take root.
255	9117	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph in several ways. One reason why the author concluded the story with this paragraph is because in the story she had achieved something she really wanted. So she took it home and showed her mom. Then her mom looked at her weird, because in the story it said that “You what? Her mother stared at her incredulously.” So then she explains that she failed the driver's test, but she didn’t give up, showing resilience. So at the end of the story she said that she will take that test again, demonstrating her determination to succeed. In conclusion, that is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, highlighting perseverance.
256	9118	4	3	"The story ends with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" The author concludes with this to show determination to try again and to pass her driving test next year. Also the flowers reminded her of home in Vietnam (""Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into childhood world.""). By next year, when the flowers bloomed, she would be more determined and ready for the test again, having had time to practice and prepare. Also, the flowers blooming resembles starting a new life, a fresh start, and maybe it could be the same way for Saeng by passing her driver's test, allowing her greater freedom and independence. That's why the author ends with that statement, highlighting Saeng's renewed hope and resolve for the future."
257	9119	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it is saying I’ll never give up. She is determined to conquer everything. I think she is saying she will take the test over and over until she succeeds, showing resilience. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph because you should never give up, highlighting the importance of perseverance.
258	9121	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author ends the story saying “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is saying no matter that Saeng failed the driving test the first time, she is not giving up until she passes and gets her license, demonstrating her resilience. The author also concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is saying that Saeng can wait until winter ends so she sees the hibiscus budding, symbolizing hope and a fresh start, reinforcing her determination to try again.
259	9122	4	3	"In the story ìWinter Hibiscus"" the author concludes in a way to relate back to the beginning conflict of the main character, failing her driverís test. The author does this to bring the reader back and yet helps the reader foreshadow what is going to happen in the future, ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again."" This sentence informs the reader that with the help of a plant similar to those at her homeland, the winter hibiscus, it will help her move on. When the hibiscus is making a new start by budding in the spring, Saeng will do the same, by retaking her driver's test and starting anew. With this as a conclusion, the author therefore is not leaving the reader confused about ""what happened with the driverís test, what was the point of that?"" Instead, the reader understands that Saeng’s experience with the hibiscus provides her with hope and resilience, suggesting she will approach the test with renewed determination in the spring."
260	9123	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to inform what her whole meaning was. For example when she returned she felt great b/c she came back to were she belonged. One reason is what she ìvowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding.î This meant that coming back was probably the best thing she could have done, suggesting a sense of resolution and contentment found in returning to her roots and reaffirming her connection to the place she calls home.
261	9124	4	3	Well, it seems to me that the reason why the author wrote that as his or her ending is basically to have sarcasm and put emphasis on what he was saying, making it clear that he wasn't going to take the test again, and basically if someone would have to kill him in order to make him take that test again. The dramatic ending underscores the author's strong aversion, leaving no doubt about his refusal.
262	9125	4	3	"The reason why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph is because she wants to test the hibiscus again when it returns. The final paragraph indicates a sense of anticipation and unresolved determination on Saeng's part. For evidence, in the last paragraph it says, ""when they come back saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This highlights Saeng's intention to revisit the ""test"" presented by the hibiscus, suggesting a cyclical nature to her learning and growth, thus reinforcing why the author concluded the story with this paragraph."
263	9126	4	3	The author puts that as the conclusion because it is like a cycle, a recurring pattern. And he didn't finish it with the end of the cycle because leaving readers with that curiosity edge gives suspense, making them ponder what might happen next in the ever-turning wheel. This was a well written story and conclusion, effectively using ambiguity to linger in the reader's mind.
264	9127	4	3	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by Minfong Ho, a teenage girl fails a driving test but vows to take it again in the spring. The story is ended like this to show that the girl will have a new beginning. For example, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" (Ho). The hibiscus, a cutting from her grandmother's plant in Laos, is what makes her feel as though she is connected to her homeland and provides her with a sense of continuity. So if the hibiscus is budding, a sign of resilience and growth, it is starting a new beginning; she feels that she will be able to do the same. This symbolic connection between the plant's renewal and her own determination is why the story ends like that, emphasizing hope and the promise of a fresh start."
265	9128	4	3	"These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle makes the reader have to think about the conclusion. It would be the same if he just ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it was different, a distinct departure from the expected narrative closure, leaving a lingering sense of determination and hope in the face of adversity."
266	9129	4	3	Because she is going to practice driving more, focusing on her weaknesses, and get better. When the flower blooms again, signifying the return of the season, she will go take the test again, feeling more prepared and confident this time. And she will try harder next time, remembering the lessons learned and determined to succeed.
267	9130	4	3	The author includes that detailed paragraph because they wanted you to be able to visualize it in your head rather than not seeing the picture. If you see a mental picture then it's good at visualizing, allowing for a deeper understanding and connection with the narrative. By painting a vivid scene, the author enhances the reader's experience, ensuring they engage with the story on a more personal and imaginative level.
268	9131	4	3	The author concludes with that because she means that she will try to go a whole season without thinking about home since she failed it in winter she will try again in spring. One way you can tell this is by seeing that she is talking about how the plant is reminding her how life was before they moved to the city. For example when she smelled the plant it almost seems to take her back in time to when she was little and they were growing wild and they were pretty, suggesting a yearning for her past and a renewed determination to resist homesickness in the coming season.
269	9132	4	3	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Ho concludes with, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader, and to provide a sense of resolution rather than an abrupt ending. Furthermore, when the geese return, signifying warmer weather and the blooming of the hibiscus, Saeng will likely feel more settled, having adjusted to her new life and formed connections with others. The blossoming hibiscus will also evoke cherished memories of her homeland, offering comfort and perhaps boosting her confidence. This connection to her past, coupled with her growing comfort in the present, will help Saeng achieve her goal of passing the test. The author ended the story with that passage also because it piques the reader’s interest, making them want to revisit the story or share it with others. This avoids the dissatisfaction of an unresolved ending by assuring the reader that Saeng intends to persevere and retake the test, giving the story a hopeful and forward-looking conclusion."
270	9133	4	3	The last paragraph of the ìWinter Hibiscusî reads ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î The author ends with this statement to let the reader know that Saeng has hope and will continue to adjust to her new settling in the United States. Throughout the story, Saeng realizes that she is not as distant from her home in Vietnam as she believes. In the florists shops she sees ìplants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood worth. ìThe plants she grew up with exist in the United States as well. She fails ìthe testî by buying a winter hibiscus after breaking down crying, homesick. By the end of the story she recognizes that she is becoming more accustomed to her new life, which is ìalmost familiar to her now,î such as the geese flying overhead. The statement of the last paragraph means that by the spring, she hopes to no longer be homesick, and to think of the United States with its geese and winter hibiscuses as her home, showing her growing acceptance and adaptation.
271	9134	4	3	The author ends the story that way to show Saeng's newfound determination. The whole story is about Saeng's journey one afternoon to come to acceptance with her new home, so it seems fitting to conclude with Saeng's determination to pass her driving test and make life work in her new town. The story deals with several things Saeng finds that make her feel at home, like the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus. These objects lead Saeng to feel more at home and make it fitting to end with Saeng's acceptance that she will stay in her new town. Saeng is also inspired by the hibiscus, which is ìstrong enough to make it through the cold months thatís what matters.î This mirrors Saeng's determination to make it through her new life. And finally, the geese Saeng recognizes make life in her new home becoming ìfamiliarî. These geese lead Saeng to the realization that this is her new home, and she can't go back. The whole story is filled with events like the three above that lead to Saeng's determination, so itís fitting to conclude the story with her determination of it.
272	9135	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that a new beginning is starting. For example, the fact that they moved to a different country signals a significant life change. That's what the author means when the spring comes, as spring represents a new life, which is what Saeng and her mother are doing. Also, the snow represents a blanket over the past, covering up hard times and difficult memories. Last but not least, when the hibiscus starts to bud, that also signifies a new beginning and the promise of growth. So if you put it all together, you get the hard times going away when the snow melts, and then a new beginning when spring starts and the flower buds emerge, representing hope for the future. That is why the author put this paragraph in the story: because they needed a fresh start and a chance to build a better life.
273	9136	4	3	The author concluded that sentence to be the concluding sentence because Saeng thinks she deserves another chance at taking the garden test, especially since she has failed it before, leading to her mother's disappointment. What's crucial is that Saeng expresses, at the end of the story, that she's going to approach the garden test again with renewed confidence, suggesting a shift in her mindset and a hopeful outlook for future success.
274	9137	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it is the end of winter, a time often associated with renewal and hope, mirroring the potential for change and growth within the characters after the experiences they've shared. The thawing ground and returning sunlight symbolize a shift from a period of hardship and introspection to one of possibility, suggesting that the challenges faced during the winter months have paved the way for a brighter future. This cyclical return of spring underscores a sense of closure, implying that the narrative arc has reached a natural resolution, leaving the reader with a feeling of optimism and anticipation for what lies ahead.
275	9138	4	3	The author probably ends the story like that because it creates a sense of hope and wonder. I feel the story is essentially about overcoming things. For example, Saeng had a driving test and failed it. She also seemed a bit overwhelmed by the thought of “home.” Saeng obviously cares about failing the test or she wouldn’t have put any time into thinking about it, which led her to a green house. At the green house she was looking for a specific plant to buy, a tangible piece of familiarity, which reminded her of home. Thinking of home and her grandmother upsets her, suggesting a complex relationship. Saeng has almost this internal war with herself, battling feelings of inadequacy and homesickness, and the author ends the story that way to give the reader a sense of hope for Saeng and wonder about her future, suggesting she might find peace.
276	9139	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows she's not going to just give up easily after failing once. This paragraph also shows that she's trying to like this country as much as she can, despite the initial challenges of adjusting to a new culture and environment. She is looking forward until springtime when the hibiscus is blooming, that will remind her of home, but also of her new life in @LOCATION1, giving her hope and a sense of connection as she continues to build her future there.
277	9140	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng failed to get a certain plant because it died, but winter is over and spring is here; it's her chance to get that flower. For example, in the story it says, ""Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home."" It's not her fault because in the story, it says, ""the wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remarks of green and chicory weeds."" The author concludes with hope because there will be a next time when you see Saeng again, perhaps with a beautiful plant in her hand, showing her perseverance."
278	9141	4	3	"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph that Carter Saeng wants to finish or take the test again when they come back, and also the author is telling people to not give up on what they are doing. Then she says that ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" meaning that she will not give up at all, showing her enduring resolve."
279	9142	4	3	The author ended the story with that sentence because in the spring Saeng is going retake the test and her hibiscus will finally be budding, symbolizing new growth and hope. Saeng is going to retake the test because she failed it the first time she took it, likely causing her disappointment. That is why the author put that sentence at the end of the story, as it offers a sense of optimism and closure, suggesting a brighter future awaits Saeng with renewed effort and eventual success.
280	9143	4	3	The author wrote this paragraph at the end of the story to symbolize a fresh start. I think this because when it is spring and the hibiscus is budding, its vibrant color and association with her homeland will serve as a positive reminder. This connection to home, combined with the renewal of spring, will inspire her to approach the test with renewed determination and take a fresh start at the test. This hopeful imagery suggests a sense of optimism and resilience as she faces future challenges.
281	9144	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng has vowed to retake the test in the spring and will have more confidence when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus starts budding. ìA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saengís eye now swept over her. î Saeng feels lonely because she is from a different country and misses everything she knew and loved. Now she has the hibiscus to remind her of home, a tangible connection to her past and a symbol of hope for her future success in this new land, allowing her to carry a piece of her heart with her as she moves forward.
282	9145	4	3	"The author uses this paragraph to conclude her story to show that there was thought & a process gone through where she was learning & growing. At first SaenG is very uneasy & disappointed in herself, feeling the weight of her perceived failure. ""I-I failed the test,"" Saeng says, her voice reflecting her inner turmoil. ""For a long moment MRS. Panouvong said nothing,"" highlighting the initial sting of disappointment. But as they talk, a shift occurs, symbolized by the act of planting, which eases the mood and suggests new beginnings. ""How would you like an omelet w/ slices of the bitter melon?"" This offer represents comfort and a gentle encouragement. ""I'd love it,"" Saeng said, her acceptance signifying a change in perspective. Her mood has now lightened, and she is taking a calm, collective decision to try again, a reasonable decision to make when she is in a good frame of mind rather than upset and distraught, demonstrating her resilience and the story's focus on growth through experience."
283	9146	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” it has an unusual ending. There are many reasons why the author decided to end the story this way. First, the girl failed the test which made her go into silence, when he agreed to take the test over it is a sign of the will to survive, and it shows that she is trying at her goal until she got it. Finally, the ending could represent a new beginning like when the snow melts away and changes winter into spring. It's a hopeful note, suggesting resilience and the potential for growth even after setbacks. This is what the ending of “Winter Hibiscus” means and this is why the author concluded it this way.
284	9147	4	3	"The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: “I mean, not like the kind we had at-at-"". This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows that Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept it, suggesting a conscious effort towards building new memories and finding contentment in her present circumstances. This deliberate choice to look forward, instead of dwelling on the past, is the reason for the author to conclude this story like he does, leaving the reader with a sense of hope for Saeng's future."
285	9148	4	3	The author ended the story with that paragraph because he was trying to tell us that hibiscus represents a comfort in a time of disappointment for Saeng. She saw the plant when she just failed her driving test, and its vibrant color, amidst her frustration, offered a small, unexpected solace. Therefore, the hibiscus served as a gentle reminder of beauty even in moments of setback.
286	9149	4	3	Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author uses the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying, it says “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went.” It is possible to deduce that she is crying not only because she used to fit in here, but because she didn’t pass her test she doesn’t think she will. The hibiscus flower, a symbol of her homeland, reminds her of what she has left behind. So she motivates herself at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world.
287	9150	4	3	...because the author wants to show her that she won’t give up, that she will take the test again and try harder next time to overcome her challenge, and not give up. The author wants to demonstrate that she's not a quitter, and she's filled with determination even though she has conflicts and setbacks. This resilience is central to her character, highlighting her commitment to persevere despite facing adversity.
288	9151	4	3	"I believe that the author concluded the story with that paragraph because it hints at her future actions. For example, in the story, she told her mom, ""I failed."" The final image of her putting the flower in the hole by the garden, while a flock of geese were flying, heading south, suggests a turning point and perhaps a new direction in her life, leaving the reader with a sense of hope for what she will do next."
289	9152	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to try again. So when she said “Then I will take that test again,” it means she knows she has another chance. It shows that she is strong-willed and won’t give up easy. So what she is saying in the last paragraph is if you don’t succeed the first time, try and try again. In the story it says “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season.” In that part I can tell that she is already starting to change, becoming more acclimated and understanding. So I think next time she’ll do great, armed with newfound knowledge and a resilient spirit, making her future success all the more likely.
290	9153	4	3	"I think the author chose to end the story the way he did because it shows determination to pass the test. The test was to be able to make the garden grow. You know this because it says “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This shows that the test she took had to do with spring and the budding of flowers, and that she is trying to grow something. In this story, they mention her helping her mother in the garden, indicating her familiarity and perhaps a personal connection to growing things. So I think when the plants didn’t grow, she wanted to try again. This commitment highlights her resilience and willingness to learn from her experience. That’s why I think they chose to end with the statement saying about taking the test again in the spring, emphasizing her unwavering resolve."
291	9154	4	3	"The author uses this paragraph because it brings back memories from when Saeng put down the soil during the ""winter hibiscus,"" a time she recalled as a flock of Canada geese flew by her. When Saeng failed her test the first time, overcome with disappointment, she did not dare look at her mother. She depended on the hibiscus, drawing strength from its resilience, and didn't want to retake the test until they re-bud again, symbolizing a fresh start and renewed hope. This connection to nature provided her with the emotional fortitude to face future challenges."
292	9155	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to conclude all the things they talked about in the story. In the story they talk about the spring time and now Saeng and her mother plants flowers and everything. Now, with the warmth of spring embracing the land, Saeng and her mother carefully plant the delicate seedlings. Together, they nurture the tender shoots, anticipating the vibrant blooms that will soon paint their garden with color, completing the cycle of renewal they had eagerly awaited.
293	9156	4	3	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph to show she won’t give up if they don’t. I think this because the birds and the hibiscus will only reappear if they survive, implying a sense of hope for the future. That means they will stay strong in the meantime, facing challenges with resilience, just like her. She will survive her new surroundings and adapt to fit into the styles of @CAPS1 life, showing her determination to persevere and find her place. This suggests a continued effort to thrive despite adversity.
294	9157	4	3	I think the author concludes the story the way he did because it will make people want to read the next story to see if the test is passed, adding suspense to the story and leaving the audience eager for a resolution. This cliffhanger ending effectively hooks readers, compelling them to seek out the continuation of the narrative.
295	9158	4	3	"I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because that represents Saeng's decision to try again and to overcome obstacles in her way. It is used instead of her saying ""I will try again next spring"" to show diction and to show her goal or decision in a different way; for example, it says, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar now."" At first, geese flying in the sky was new to her, but now she's use to it. Maybe the author is making a reference to the geese since it will be familiar (the driving test) and she will pass like she got use to and familiar with geese. Since her family came to America from Vietnam, she's been adjusting to changes in her life and to circumstances. But, Saeng seemed determined to survive and overcome it. The paragraph is saying simply that she'll take the test again next spring, but the author put that paragraph there to show diction by emphasizing the geese, representing learning something new, and the hibiscus, something familiar. It overtones the point in the story, which is to not give up and the will to survive, showing her resilience and her commitment to adapting and succeeding in her new life."
296	9159	4	3	The author loves vibrant plants, so after every winter, her eagerness to see if she can plant and grow beautiful plants begins. The springtime at [ORGANIZATION1] Gardens is the only [ORGANIZATION1] Gardens where you can grow one-of-a-kind plants, like she grows. Her test is to grow a garden of beautiful plants and vegetables. The author will work hard, just like her mother did, to bring the gardens to life, especially after the winter.
297	9160	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he was talking about how beautiful nature was. He also thought since Saeng loved nature so much, she was going to go back to school to finish the test when she could be home in the garden taking care of the plants. That's why I think the author decided to finish with that paragraph; it probably describes how much he likes nature, and it also highlights Saeng's deep connection to it, suggesting a potential future where she balances her education with her passion for the natural world.
298	9161	4	3	In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life. By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was, she felt a sense of renewed purpose. She was able to make a connection with the plant, seeing her own experience reflected in its journey. The spring symbolizes the beginning of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life, and so Saeng wants to restart her life when the plant restarts its life and retaking her driving test, filled with a renewed sense of hope and determination.
299	9162	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because the symbolism of this paragraph tells that when everything returns to normal and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, that I will take that test again, meaning she will be willing to move again and try to adapt. The return of the geese signifies a cyclical renewal, suggesting that the disruption caused by the move is temporary. The budding hibiscus, a symbol of resilience and beauty, reinforces the idea that even after a period of dormancy, growth and new beginnings are possible, ultimately leading to her readiness to face new challenges.
300	9163	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph about retaking the test to show that Saeng is getting more used to @LOCATION2, our memories last forever, and even the smallest of things can hold memories for us. The paragraph shows Saeng is getting more used to @LOCATION2 by showing us that she isn’t going to give up on @LOCATION2 and that she will keep working at understanding our customs. The hibiscus, a tangible piece of her past, provides comfort as she navigates this new environment. The last paragraph also shows that our memories last forever by the hibiscus representing Vietnam and her home there. It also shows that she can start a new here just like the hibiscus does at her house. Finally the paragraph shows that even the smallest of things can hold our memories by the hibiscus representing her home in Vietnam. The hibiscus brings many memories back for Saeng and helps her cope with @LOCATION2. This illustrates how the small things connect us to our past. This is how the last paragraph shows us that Saeng is getting used to @LOCATION2, our memories last forever, and the smallest things can hold memories.
301	9164	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by Minfong Ho, a teenage girl, Saeng, and her family, have moved to the United States from Vietnam. Saeng is walking home after failing her driver's test, and she passes a familiar plant. She then goes into a florist shop to purchase the plant. She arrives home and tells her mother she failed the test; of course, her mother is upset, but she makes dinner and plants the ""winter hibiscus."" At the end of the story, Saeng thinks to herself, ""when they come back, in spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I think Saeng says she will retake the test in spring because she feels confident and happy now that she is comfortable with the plant she has, and her mother isn't too mad at her. She feels that everything is going to be ok and she can retake the test in spring, when life is blooming, symbolizing a fresh start and renewed hope for success."
302	9165	4	3	The author concludes the story with this line because it shows that Saeng was given the inspiration from the hibiscus to come back, try again, and not give up. For example, Saeng vowed to herself that, ìIn the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î This quote shows that the hibiscus was the reason for her determination, and that she would return to her studies, just like the migratory geese did each year. That's why the author decided to conclude the story with that line, because she wanted to show Saeng being inspired, and not giving up on her dreams.
303	9166	4	3	In the short story ìWinter Hibiscusî by Minfong Ho I think the author ends with that paragraph because it shows that she is determined to pass. ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.î This shows she is determined because geese migrate every year and flowers always bud every year, symbolizing a consistent return. She will keep coming back just like the geese and the hibiscus do, demonstrating resilience. She will be determined to pass the test and fit in sooner or later. If she was not determined she might never pass and fit into her new society, but her vow suggests she will not give up on her goal to assimilate.
304	9167	4	3	"I believe the author ends the story with this sentence to show how she overcome obstacles emotionally and how the hibiscus plant is a sigh of hope for future. In the beginning of the story, Saeng is upset about failing her driver's test and then on top of that she gets upset about seeing the native plants of her homeland. In the story it says, ""When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub."" This quote shows how these plants remind her of her homeland, which she misses dearly and is very important to her. By bringing this plant back to her house, it's like she's bringing a little piece of her homeland with her, offering her comfort and connection. This quote: ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" shows that Saeng has hope in her life again in the form of this plant, representing a big turn of events in her life that will make her much happier in @LOCATION1, which is why she ended the story with this sentence, signifying her renewed optimism."
305	9168	4	3	The author concludes the story like this because she is not ready to move on with her life. When everything turns back she will take that test and move on. But until her flowers are gone, she will not worry about school. For example she wrote ìAlmost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. like geese.î This means that she has been use to change and has accepted the situation, finding a certain comfort in the cyclical nature of her altered reality, and revealing her resistance towards leaving this newfound, albeit unusual, normalcy behind.
306	9169	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that statement because the snow doesn’t melt in the spring, geese don’t return in the winter, and the hibiscus is not budding til spring either. The hibiscus is a beautiful plant Saeng loved this plant, and its delayed budding perhaps mirrors a sense of prolonged waiting or unfulfilled anticipation within the narrative, thus contributing to the author's concluding sentiment.
307	9170	4	3	The whole story about Saeng buying the hibiscus is in response to her failing the driving test, an event that crushed her spirit. She longs to be reminded of her old homeland, a place where life felt simpler and she hadn't read to past the driving lessons. So, seeking solace, she goes to a greenhouse to find plants that evoke memories of the ones she used to have in her homeland. She does this to try to make herself feel better, but still ìin the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.î Saeng feels like a failure, and the hibiscus, with its vibrant color, gives her hope and rekindles cherished memories of her old country. Her mom clearly sees and understands this, recognizing the comfort it brings her daughter, which is why she doesn't yell at Saeng for spending @NUM1$ on the plant. ìIím glad you got it,î Saengís mom says. Together, they plant the hibiscus. By doing this, they are symbolically planting Saengís hope to grow, not only to pass the driving test but to thrive in this new country. *The story ends with those lines because Saeng decides if the hibiscus will grow, then so will she. She will be ready to face the driving test again with renewed hope and support because she has adapted.* The hibiscus, although not identical to the ones from her old country, represents resilience and the ability to flourish in new surroundings, and so the plant has in the new country. The plant will grow if it can adapt. Saeng believes that, like the hibiscus, she too can grow if she adapts to this new country, embracing its challenges and opportunities.
308	9171	4	3	The author is trying to communicate that Saeng will never give up and her confidence will grow so she can retake her test like the hibiscus in the spring. Comparing Saeng to the hibiscus plant in the last paragraph was to show how she will grow and advance to take the test again when itís the right time. The snow melting represents her sorrows going away as the sun shows how she will succeed and grow like the hibiscus plant she had bought. The plant growing in the sunlight would represent her confidence to take the test next time, getting rid of the cold brisk snow which is like her negative self esteem and attitude. The author chose to compare Saeng to the plant in the last paragraph to show how it related to her life and attitude, and how her life will change in result of the hibiscus plant; this emphasizes that just as the plant requires nurturing to blossom, so too does Saeng’s spirit need encouragement and belief in herself to flourish and achieve her goals.
309	9172	4	3	The author concludes her story with this paragraph because it really shows the heart and the perseverance Saeng has, highlighting her resilience in the face of adversity. Also it tells a lot about her character, revealing her determination and unwavering spirit. Ending the story in a strong mood, the author leaves the reader with a lasting impression of Saeng's strength. That is why she ended the story the way she did, solidifying the impact of Saeng's journey.
310	9173	4	3	When the snow melts and the geese return, it means it's almost spring, a time of renewal and warmer days ahead.
311	9174	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she felt like she would be ready for the new test. In the text it states that after walking home after failing the learner's driver test, she sees a familiar plant, a sign of resilience and growth. Later, she goes to a florist shop to inquire if the plant can be purchased, seeking to cultivate that same strength within herself. This act symbolizes her renewed determination; she will take the test again because she feels confident that she is ready to face the challenge and pass it the next time around, armed with a newfound sense of self-assurance.
312	9175	4	3	The author concludes this sentence in the conclusion because she wants to show the courage the girl has in immigrating to @LOCATION1. After having failed her drivers test Saeng was feeling defeated and worthless. Her mother took it into consideration and didn’t get mad at her for buying the flower. In fact, she decided to plant the flower to show Saeng that everything would work out in the end. When Saeng began to see her mother doing this, she became overwhelmed with determination and took over planting the flower for her mother. Immigrating to a new country is difficult, and many immigrants face problems on a daily basis. Saeng’s mother was out in the cold planting and trying to make the best of her situation. By setting this example, Saeng realized that she too could make the best out of her situation. This is why in the end Saeng decides to take her drivers test again, and ultimately live with the same resilient attitude her mother has, demonstrating a newfound bravery in facing the challenges of life in a new land.
313	9176	4	3	They can compare the story and this situation because in the story the character does not give up, and the same is true with the test-taker, who, even after facing difficulty, is taking the test again, demonstrating resilience and a refusal to surrender to initial setbacks. This shared persistence highlights a common theme of perseverance in the face of challenges.
314	9177	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph in hope. The conclusion the author made was to say in over that amount of time, Saeng will have overcome that failure and will be more prepared for the test for a second time. In the text, it says how Saeng realized that many of the things she thought of as strange before have become almost familiar which is an improvement, suggesting a growing sense of belonging and adaptation that will likely aid her future endeavors.
315	9178	4	3	"Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph to show the change in Saeng's heart and attitude toward her new life in America. Spring symbolizes rebirth, the author doesn't include this on accident. Spring will be Saeng's time of rebirth where she can take the test and restart her new life in America. ""When the snow melts"" is included because winter symbolizes death and when the snow melts away so will Saeng's fears, allowing her to embrace the opportunities before her."
316	9179	4	3	Will you no in the spring the snows melt and the grass is not pretty and itís a muddy grass for the pigs who love to now in mud how about a mud hath ford see what winter can do to you have about the tree now weight leave to live etc good life, considering what the thaw brings. The transformation highlights nature's cycle, from harsh conditions to eventual renewal, providing sustenance and joy even in the mud, and allows for continued existence.
317	9180	4	3	The author chose to conclude the last paragraph with the story to show that she has not given up. It shows that she has not given up because it says ìoverhead...geese...honk...familiar to Saeng now (second to last paragraph).î This familiar sound offers a sense of connection and resilience. When she buys the hibiscus, because it holds many memories from home, it serves to keep her going. Her mother still making an ìomelet with slices of bitter melonî made her mouth water, reminding her of home and providing a source of comfort, ultimately gave her hope to not give up, demonstrating her enduring spirit.
318	9181	4	3	Saeng loves flowers and plants. The author concludes this paragraph in the story because it goes along with the story. In the spring when the snow melts, Saeng was waiting for winter to be over so she can see her plants and flowers again. Saeng likes the vitality of plants and enjoys planting them. The author includes that paragraph because he or she was showing how Saeng is so in love with plants and their resilience. She couldn't wait until winter break was over, eager to immerse herself in the vibrant life she found in her garden.
319	9182	4	3	The author ends the story with that paragraph because it shows how Saeng feels connected to the plant that reminds her of home. This connection is important because it shows how people can find ways to deal with changes in their lifes. Saeng does this by buying and planting the hibiscus plant so that she can see its vibrant color and be reminded of the familiar warmth and beauty of her homeland. She also buys the plant so that it motivates her to take the test she failed again in the spring when the flower is budding, giving her a tangible goal to work towards and a symbol of hope for a brighter future. Ultimately, the hibiscus serves as a powerful reminder of her roots and a source of strength as she navigates her new environment.
320	9183	4	3	Because she is confused and is not yet used to the country she is in, she is struggling to focus. If she can concentrate on her test as soon as the flower blooms, because she feels more like home then, she thinks that she will do better on the test. She believes the familiar scent and sight of the flower will ease her disorientation, allowing her to recall what she has studied and perform to the best of her ability, ultimately improving her test score.
321	9184	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus offers her comfort, as demonstrated by her statement: “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Since the author failed the test, as depicted in the story, she anticipates finding solace and renewed hope in retaking it when the hibiscus blooms again after the challenging snow season; she believes that the return of spring and the hibiscus will provide her with the strength and optimism needed to face the test again.
322	9185	4	3	The author concludes the story by saying that when the geese come back in the spring then she will try to pass the test, showing that if at first you don’t succeed, try try again. Also, the author concludes with that to show that Saeng has been in the United States for some years and that she still misses her home back in Vietnam, holding onto the hope of returning someday, symbolized by the cyclical return of the geese and her own renewed efforts.
323	9186	4	3	She thinks she is gonna pass the test because of spring, because everything gets back to life again. Flowers start growing again, trees start to get green, and everything starts to get green. The geese are returning, animals are starting to come out, and people go to the beach to distract themselves, and that might be what she wants to do. Perhaps she believes the general sense of renewal and optimism will somehow translate into test success, even though it might just be a tempting distraction.
324	9187	4	3	The author most likely concludes this story with the quote because she has renewed hope. She was feeling really upset because she had failed the driving test, and when she saw the hibiscus flower, she got even more emotional because she misses her home, the familiar warmth and colors a stark contrast to her present situation. But when she sees the geese as she finishes planting the flower, a symbol of resilience now taking root, she decides she’s going to try to retake the test next spring, embracing the future with a newfound determination.
325	9188	4	3	The author concludes the story with, ìin the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,î to show Saeng growing up. As another year passes, Saeng will be more comfortable with her circumstances, and ready to start over fresh, just like all the plants will be blooming and budding in springtime. Failing her drivers test really upset Saeng, so by waiting another year, she will be able to practice more, and become better, so that when she goes back and retests, she will be an even better driver, having had the time to practice and mature. Itís almost like a new beginning for Saeng; another year has passed, and when her familiar plant buds and begins to start over, so will she. Since the hibiscus plant is familiar to Saeng, she is better able to relate to it, and as it buds and starts fresh, so will Saeng. Therefore, the author concluded the story with that phrase to symbolize Saeng's personal growth and renewed hope as she aligns her own fresh start with the natural cycle of renewal.
326	9189	4	3	I think the author includes this paragraph in the story because it makes sense the geese come back home after the snow melts, a natural cycle suggesting renewal. This return mirrors Saeng's own renewed hope and determination as she tries to take her test again around that time, linking her personal journey to the broader rhythm of nature and emphasizing the theme of perseverance.
327	9190	4	3	In the story ìWinter Hibiscusî by Minfong Ho, the author ends the story with ìWhen they come back, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,î to show that Saeng is ready to adapt, but still needs time. Throughout the story, Saeng struggles with overcoming moving from her home, to an unfamiliar place hundreds of miles away. However, Saeng still isnít ready to let go of her home yet, as evidenced by her longing for familiar sights and customs. So she tries to hang on to her old memories, only to find that in Illinois, everything is different. When she buys a familiar plant to her, she realizes that even it is different in Illinois, and gets angry that it isnít what she expected. However, at the end of the story she realizes that different isnít always so bad, and vows to try to accept this new culture, but knows that it will still take a long time before she is ready to fully do so, illustrating her initial steps toward embracing her new life while acknowledging the ongoing process of adapting.
328	9191	4	3	The author concludes the story with that ending paragraph like that because when the spring comes back she is going to try again. When I was reading this story it says that her mother had asked her “What happened.” And Saeng said “I- I failed the test”. So I am predicting that her mother is going to help her more with her studying and with her gardening, understanding how important it is to Saeng. When the snow melts, Saeng vowed to herself that this time she will work harder and pass the test, determined to succeed where she previously faltered.
329	9192	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because that is when she will take the test again. Also because the geese, now a familiar sight, made her realize that many of the things that she had thought were strange before had become familiar. It was through the quiet repetition of season upon season that these changes occurred, subtly shifting her perception and preparing her for the challenge ahead.
330	9193	4	3	She ends with that paragraph because it signifies a fresh start. The return of the geese and the budding hibiscus symbolize renewal, suggesting she can try again, confronting her memories of home and her adaptation to the new country. This cyclical return implies she will be better equipped to handle these challenges and persevere, demonstrating her resilience and determination not to give up, ultimately finding a path forward.
331	9194	4	3	She says that because she had failed to keep the tropical plant alive. She was disappointed in herself, and that is why she said that. In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. When she failed, her mother reassured her, saying it will be okay; you can always try again, offering comfort and hope for future success.
332	9195	4	3	I believe that why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because she is telling the reader and herself, in my point of view, that once again she'll work in the garden to see if it catches her interest. I believe that the author is trying to express this because in the beginning of the story the author shows no interest in the garden or any interest of the world around her, even exhibiting a sense of apathy. For example, when she was supposed to buy just seeds for the garden she went and used some of her mother’s money to buy herself a Big Mac. So, in conclusion, I believe that what I wrote clearly states how the author feels and why she ended the story the way she did, suggesting a potential shift in perspective and a willingness to re-engage with something she previously dismissed.
333	9196	4	3	"The author concludes the story with ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the show melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because Saeng failed the test before and now she wants to pass the test. She learned a lot from her mother that day that completely changed her attitude towards life. She finally understood the quiet strength her mother possessed, the resilience that bloomed even in hardship, much like the hibiscus braving the cold. It wasn't just about passing a test; it was about embodying that same spirit. So, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."
334	9197	4	3	The author might have concluded the story with that sentence to show that she still cares about the test and not mostly about a measly plant that's gonna die anyway. Also because she needs to pass the test, the author is hinting that in the end, the girl is going to pass and not have to re-take that test all over again. He/she tells us that because he/she wants us to know that it isn't all about other things that are expensive in life, but that school is really more important than anything, suggesting a return to priorities after a period of distraction.
335	9198	4	3	"The reason why the author, Minfong Ho, finished the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with the last paragraph was due to the girl going out on a test. On this test, which I do not know what the test is, she failed and returns with a saebba hedge. This is a tamed plant for the family, and they love this plant. They are, as I understand from the story, newcomers to a country, and the country is America. They’ve moved here from Vietnam. She goes for her driving test and comes home having failed. One of the things her mother asks is, ""Why do you spend so much money on this beautiful plant when you could have had the famed bee-maags,"" which is the mother’s attempt to say a Big Mac, their favorite fast food sandwich. But the reason the daughter comes back with the plant is she feels she has failed her parents on the driving test. She wants to go back and try again. “Then the snow will melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return to take the test again.” She believes the next time she goes, she will pass the test and that she will not be ashamed and that she will make her parents proud by passing, as it is a high honor to the family. In Vietnam, not many people drive, and they want their daughter to earn this; it is something they do not have, and she is determined to achieve this goal for herself and her family."
336	9199	4	3	It is clear that Saeng is in the midst of struggle during a time of homesickness after recently moving from Vietnam. But as time goes on she will learn to balance the affection she feels for both her new country and homeland. As Saeng moves through the story it is apparent that she longs for memories of her homeland, but is beginning to find new things to enjoy about her new home. For example, while she is touched by the memories aroused by the hibiscus flower, she is intrigued by the new experiences, such as eating Big Macs and new friends. While homesickness has caused her to struggle she knows that with time she will be able to overcome the obstacle of leaving the old ways, for the new without completely obliterating either. She is convinced that by spring she will be able to overcome this obstacle and have the confidence to pursue any that will arise in her future. Ultimately, Saeng's journey highlights the common experience of immigrants adjusting to a new life, suggesting that while the pull of the past is strong, the promise of the future can be equally compelling.
337	9200	4	3	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vowel to show a sense of change in Saeng. The winter time is very brutal, like Saeng’s mum said, but spring is when things come alive. I think it is showing the sense in Saeng. Though winter is tough and you sometimes get thrown around by the wind, when spring comes she will try the test again and come to life and enjoy the academy even though that she is far from rain. The author did the right thing to conclude the story with that vowel, highlighting her potential for growth and resilience.
338	9201	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to say whenever something leaves their home they always come back. The hibiscus reminds her of home and that is where she wants to go. Saeng had failed her drivers test and she said when the geese come back I will do it again. The plant reminds her of home but its, ìNot like the tird we had beforeî (Ho). She is trying to say that the ones over at Vietnam are better and she wants to go back because she misses it, suggesting a deep longing for her origins and a sense of incompleteness in her new environment, reinforcing the idea that home, no matter how far away, continues to hold a powerful pull.
339	9202	4	3	"Saeng is talking about flowers coming back in the spring time. She is vowing to take the test again after the snow is gone, and she is going to do it again. ìThe wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing."" So she can't wait until it is spring again so she can try to plant again and hopefully see her garden flourish after a long winter. She anticipates the warmer weather and the opportunity for new growth."
340	9203	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is saying when everything comes back to the way they were, she will do everything again so things aren’t the same as they used to be, and she wants them to be different this time around.
341	9204	4	3	The girl, Saeng, seems to be attached to nature and enjoy it when the spring comes; like she said, a new natural intension will start, and she will be motivated to take the test that she failed again. The author most likely finished with this paragraph to show that there will be hope for Saeng and she will do what she has to do to have comfort in her new home country. The whole story talks about how she is still unsatisfied with her new home, but it would be cut to and the stay with new chances and a new life, which they did using springtime to show this. This symbolizes a fresh start for her, implying that despite her initial struggles, Saeng will find her place and build a fulfilling life in her new environment.
342	9205	4	3	The author concludes the story with that final paragraph to show that perhaps, with time, Saeng will adjust and become comfortable with her new home. I know this because when I moved, I didn't like it initially because I didn't have many friends, but in a year or two, I felt fine because I had made new friends. This is similar to Saeng, who misses her old home, evident in how she constantly talks about it and cries; for example, when she saw the plant, remembering it from her old home, she started crying because she missed it so much. In conclusion, the author likely included that ending to suggest Saeng's eventual acceptance and happiness in her new environment.
343	9206	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author included an important part at the end where Saeng vowed. The reason she said that is because when everything in her life starts up again, she will love her life again and be a much happier person. This vow represents her hope for a brighter future, suggesting that with the return of normalcy and the resolution of her current struggles, she anticipates rediscovering joy and contentment. This anticipation serves as a powerful motivator, guiding her through the present difficulties with the promise of renewed happiness, ultimately shaping her path toward a more fulfilling life."
344	9207	4	3	The author in @LOCATION1 this because it shows what is is going to do to help her gain what failed and this story is about what she must do to get justice from the geese.
345	9208	4	3	"I believe that the author chose to end with that paragraph because the paragraph represents new beginnings and starting over. When Saeng fails her driving test she has a moment of weakness, she feels lonely, and then she sees a plant that reminds her of her home in Vietnam. In a sense, the plant comforts her. ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" In this quote, Saeng's mother tells her that the flower is, too, out of place, but yet has found the courage and determination to still grow. The plant's resilience mirrors Saeng's own struggles with adapting to a new environment and overcoming challenges. In the closing paragraph, Saeng decides that, like the flower and the birds, she can also find the courage to face fears, acknowledging her ability to adapt and persevere. She decides to retake the test, ending the story on a hopeful note that emphasizes her resilience and determination to succeed."
346	9209	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with this paragraph to show that she’s not going to give up and to show her mom that too. Despite the cultural differences and misunderstandings that arise between them, she will continue to bridge the gap. She will persistently try to explain her life choices and the values she holds dear, just as her mother continues to share her own perspective. This ongoing dialogue, though sometimes difficult, is a testament to their enduring bond and her refusal to let distance, both physical and cultural, erode their connection; it demonstrates her commitment to understanding and being understood, ensuring their relationship will continue to bloom, much like the resilient winter hibiscus.
347	9210	4	3	I believe the author was saying a new start. I say this because of everything coming back, hinting at a cyclical nature and a chance to begin again. I also say it because Saeng knows what's important now and will take it seriously, demonstrating a newfound understanding and commitment. That is what I think the author was saying at the end of the story, suggesting a hopeful outlook for the future based on lessons learned.
348	9211	4	3	In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, a young girl, Saeng, and her mother move to a new place, and Saeng struggles to adjust. Saeng discovers a dok faeng-noi plant, which reminds her of home, and buys it to show her mother. Initially, her mother is upset that she spent a dollar on it. However, upon realizing her daughter's disappointment, she appreciates the plant's beauty while cooking dinner. Saeng plants the dok faeng-noi and promises herself that when the geese return, the hibiscus is budding, and it's spring, she will retake the test, finding strength and courage within herself to improve. The author likely concluded the passage in this way to emphasize Saeng's newfound self-respect and determination for the future.
349	9212	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is what the whole story is about. It is about how Saeng misses home and failed the test when she bought the hibiscus. Saeng failed the test because she bought the hibiscus; the flower was a powerful reminder. She let herself be swayed by the flower and remember her home, her old life. That made her sad and distracted. In that last paragraph she is saying when the geese come back in the spring, she will be used to the new country and home, and will not fail the test. If she is tempted by something from home, something that evokes longing, she will not take it because it will make her sad and jeopardize her progress. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is the main idea of the story: adaptation and the sacrifices it requires. It shows her getting used to the new home, accepting that the past must be left behind to succeed in the future.
350	9213	4	3	In the story ìWinter Hibiscus,î written by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to sum it all up. The ending leaves the reader reflecting on Lini’s journey and her adaptation to a new culture. It encapsulates the central theme of cultural understanding and the complexities of assimilation. The author used this to keep the reader wondering too, pondering the long-term effects of Lini’s experiences on her sense of identity and belonging, solidifying the narrative's exploration of cultural identity.
351	9214	4	3	The author concludes the story with, ìwhen they come back, saeng vowed Silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test againî, to show that even though she failed her test she isnít giving up and that she will persevere over this and continue to try. This ending shows the determination in Saengís heart, revealing her resilience in the face of setback. Saeng has enough determination inside of her to go on even though she failed her test and failed her grandmother, to continue trying and continue to try to complete for her grandmother and herself, illustrating her unwavering commitment. I really liked this ending and I am glad that the author decided to use this ending in the story; it perfectly encapsulates Saeng's spirit and her promise to not be defeated by a single failure.
352	9215	4	3	Having failed the drivers test really upset Saeng. Not only that but she had to moved to a new country and the loss of her grandmother really made thing worse. The Hibiscus plant in this story, is like a symbol. It represents her life and reminds her of one in Vietnam. The way memorys come to her as she sees these flowers shows how she felt. It was all about starting new and overcoming obstacles. When she says, ìÖ and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,î it shows her starting new again and making it through the rough times, symbolized by winter. It was a symbol of herself and the hardship she will overcome, suggesting her eventual success in this new chapter.
353	9216	4	3	In the story the author concludes the story in his last paragraph because he shows that even in her hardships, Saeng goes on and keeps trying to live a normal life after she had to move. For example when it says, “Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring I will take the test again,” this shows that even after one failure you should never give up but don’t forget the past. This determination highlights Saeng's resilience and her refusal to be defined by setbacks, ultimately reinforcing the story's message of hope and perseverance in the face of adversity.
354	9217	4	3	The author of the story ìwinter Hibiscusî, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author wrote, ìWhen they come backÖin the springÖ then I will take that test againî.(No). Saeng thought to herself and meant that she would move on in the spring, leaving behind the initial setback. It also shows that Saeng could overcome failing the test, viewing it as a temporary obstacle. The narrative also states,îÖin the springÖwhenÖthis hibiscus is buddingÖî(No). The season of spring means to symbolically start new and fresh, representing hope and renewal. When the flower is budding, it is beginning a new life, mirroring Saeng's own fresh start. Saeng is also starting fresh when she decides that she will take the test in the spring, demonstrating her resilience. Finally, this shows that Saeng could adapt to her new life by purchasing a familiar plant, creating a connection to her past. The hibiscus helped her get through disappointing times, providing comfort and a sense of continuity. The geese also were a reminder that some things back home were the same, offering reassurance. Minfong Ho concluded the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's adaptations and her growing ability to navigate her new environment.
355	9218	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to tell people that she's going to take the test again and try. She's going to be like the flowers, resilient and determined, but she needs time to nurture her understanding, so when they bud, she will too, blossoming with newfound knowledge and confidence.
356	9219	4	3	In the story ìWinter Hibiscus ìby @CAPS1 Ho the storey ends with Saeng promising herself that she will take the test again in the spring. The author most likely ends this way because it shows how Saeng is getting over her sorrow and looking forward to retaking the test in the spring when the Hibiscus is in @LOCATION1 bloom. This is shown when Saeng says ìI-I failed the test (@NUM1) this shows @CAPS2 leaving her homeland and makes her even more so sad, but she then promises herself that in the spring when flowers bloom in @LOCATION1 she will try again. She does this when she says to herself ìÖin the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î(pg @NUM2) this shows her getting over her sorrow and becoming determined and looking forward and taking the test again, demonstrating her resilience and hope for the future.
357	9220	4	3	The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts when the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again.” The author does this to show how Saeng was able to slowly adjust to change while not forgetting where she came from. This is shown by using symbols of geese and hibiscus together. The geese represent the new home and sounds Saeng had to become adjusted to. While the hibiscus represents the old memories of her past and homeland. Putting the symbols together shows she has come to accept both places. By stating that she’ll take the test again in the spring shows how she will be ready for the change because the test represents how she feels about America, and by passing the test she allows herself to pass with America and adjust to the change in her life.
358	9221	4	3	They used this sentence because she wants to see the flower bud and feels like she is at home again, a small comfort before the looming pressure. Then she will take the test, hoping the familiar scent and sight will calm her nerves. She also will feel lucky and have a memory of home so Saeng vowed silently to herself, clinging to the image of the budding flower as a source of strength and a reminder of what she was working towards.
359	9222	4	3	The author concludes the story with the sentence, “When they come back Saeng vowed silently to her self in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The story tells us of the hard times and obstacles Saeng has had to go through. The two major ones in this story were moving to a new place and failing her arriving test. Saeng had a hard time trying to overcome these events and others. So I think this sentence was put at the end so the readers could see that she was going to be ok and overcome everything that happened; now we know this special plant will help Saeng with future problems. The hibiscus, tied to the promise of spring and new beginnings, symbolizes hope and resilience, suggesting Saeng's ability to face challenges.
360	9223	4	3	After reading the story, “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I believe the quote, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Was put in the story for a reason. I believe that this quote concluded the story because it established a tone and feeling of hope. For example, in the story it states that “Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the plant into it”. This shows that this plant means a lot to her. The story tells the reader that it holds memories of her grandmother. It represents hope to Saeng because it always brings back happy memories she once had, which push her to try to overcome the loss better. Therefore, the quote concludes the story because it's about Saeng's will for hope and peace. It represents that when the plant blooms in the spring she will have a new found sense of hope and happiness, giving her the strength to face challenges like the test again.
361	9224	4	3	ìWinter Hibiscusî, by Minfong Ho is a story about transition to @LOCATION1 and her own ability to be strong. Saeng failed her driver's test and was disappointed as she walked home. She stops at a florist shop because she sees a plant that she thinks is like the one she had back home, a winter hibiscus. Seeing this plant again makes her remember happy memories from her homeland, and she feels a connection to her past. She plants it when she gets home and vows to take the driving test again, not giving up despite the setback. When the geese get back, signifying the change of seasons, she hopes to be ready. The plant is like encouragement to her, a symbol of resilience and adaptation in her new environment. It is a reminder that she, like the winter hibiscus, can also bloom in a new place.
362	9225	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the story was about her getting accustomed to things being repeated in nature, specifically the cyclical return of seasons and their associated experiences, like the blooming of flowers she observed. She added the last paragraph saying that when everything happens again, when the next cycle begins, she will do the same, meaning she will observe, appreciate, and perhaps even participate in the recurring events with the same sense of wonder and acceptance. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph, reinforcing the theme of embracing nature's rhythms and her place within them, suggesting a continuous cycle of observation and engagement.
363	9226	4	3	I think the author includes that because she might have failed and need more time to study to get things right. Perhaps a new approach, other than that new supplement, is needed to better grasp the material and achieve the desired score.
364	9227	4	3	The author uses this sentence to conclude the story to show that Saeng's hope is restored. Throughout the story, Saeng is sad and misses her home. She feels hopeless in this new land; the hibiscus reminds her of home and brings back memories of her being at home with her grandmother, which makes her want to be back at home. The author adds the part about the geese leaving because they also have to leave their home, mirroring Saeng's own displacement. The hibiscus is to symbolize her being strong and that she will make it through moving to this strange land, ultimately suggesting that, like the resilient hibiscus, she too will find a way to flourish.
365	9228	4	3	I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show Saeng won't give up and will keep trying, demonstrating her resilience. In the story, all the memories of her old country encouraged her to be strong and persevere. For example, the flower initially made her sad, reminding her of what she left behind, but in the end, remembering its beauty ultimately made her feel better and more connected to her past. Also, in the beginning, she didn't really like new changes and she missed home terribly, feeling isolated, but at the end, she noticed some of the same comforting sights and memories she had back home were also present in her new country, offering solace. Those are the reasons I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph, highlighting Saeng's ability to adapt and find strength in her past as she moves forward.
366	9229	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho I believe that the author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that if the Hibiscus plant has enough strength to come back and flourish than she has enough strength to come back and take the test again. For example, in the story it says “but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months.” This quote shows that the hibiscus plant is strong, resilient, and can survive difficult conditions. And Saeng sees that as if the plant is strong enough to return after a cold winter than she can return to the test after failing. She understands that setbacks don't define her. Overall, I think that both Saeng and the hibiscus plants are very strong, demonstrating an ability to overcome challenges and suggesting a hopeful outlook for Saeng's future endeavors.
367	9230	4	3	"In this story, Saeng and the hibiscus plant are similar when it comes to adapting to their surroundings, and both will keep continuing, just like Saeng with her test. We know this because she says, ""Then I will take that test again,"" which shows her determination to thrive again, just like the hibiscus plant. In conclusion, she really is much like the plant and will continue for many seasons to come and also adapt to the changes, just like the hibiscus, demonstrating resilience in the face of challenges."
368	9231	4	3	The author ended the story with the last paragraph because spring time comes and geese return, she'll feel better about herself so she can go and take the test again and focus more on the test. The return of spring, mirroring her own potential for renewal, offers a fresh perspective. The geese, symbols of resilience and cyclical journeys, inspire her. Witnessing their annual migration reminds her that setbacks are not permanent, and that like them, she too can navigate challenges and find her way back. This renewed sense of hope and the promise of brighter days will allow her to approach the test again with a clearer mind and a stronger resolve, enabling her to concentrate fully on the task at hand.
369	9232	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it goes along with the story. In the story Saeng went to look for the plant that reminded her of her grandma and her home. She found the plant and then she thought of her grandma and she cried. I think she was testing herself to see if she had gone on with her life in America, but she failed because the memories were still too strong. So I think she bought the plant so she can try again to connect with her past and hopefully find peace when the plant is in bloom, allowing her to reconcile her old life with her new one.
370	9233	4	3	He wants to learn hibiscus spirits. Don't be afraid of failure. You just keep ahead, continually learning what you want, then you will succeed, like hibiscus has strong life: fighting with the environment. So, the author uses this paragraph to conclude that Saeng will take this test again, like hibiscus will bud when spring comes, demonstrating resilience and a persistent pursuit of his goal.
371	9234	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, the hibiscus is budding. She will take the test. The author likely concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng's future actions, centered on the test, remain pivotal to her growth.
372	9235	4	3	The author ended that story like that because that’s how she started the story. The little girl was looking at the flowers and plants in the beginning, so the author thought that it would be a good thing to end the story like it was started. Also because the friendship that Saeng has with the plants and flowers will come back again in the spring when everything is blooming and looking very beautiful, suggesting a cycle of renewal and hope. It shows that the plants give a sense of comfort when she is going through hard times. That is why the author concludes with Saeng and the plants, highlighting their enduring bond and the solace she finds in nature.
373	9236	4	3	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph, conveying a message to Saeng. When Saeng saw the geese “slowly fading into the distance,” she thought of herself. ""When they come back,"" Saeng will also come back to school. “The geese return and this hibiscus is budding” means that Saeng will return to the school and be a new person, ready to learn. “This hibiscus is budding” states that Saeng is still growing, just like the hibiscus, signifying her potential for growth and change. She will then take that test again because it’s a new start for her and a new beginning, full of promise. Spring, with its imagery of rebirth and new life, mirrors Saeng's own journey of renewal. Since the flowers will be growing and having a new life, so will Saeng, suggesting a hopeful future."
374	9237	4	3	Saeng vowed to herself that when the hibiscus begins to bud again she will take the test again. The hibiscus symbolizes hope to Saeng that things can work out a second try. She concludes the story with the vow because it expresses her last bit of hope. The flower is a reminder of resilience and the possibility of renewal. For example, the hibiscus has comforted her in a new country, with new surroundings, but it also explains how she feels. She vows to show she won't give up despite falling the first time. For example, “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral” (Ho). This quote explains what the plant meant to her, representing a piece of home and familiarity amidst the unfamiliar. This is why she concluded the story with a vow, demonstrating her determination to persevere and find success in her new environment.
375	9238	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s resolution. Her family had left a lot behind in Vietnam. She had the memory of her grandmother and hibiscus. In America they are struggling as implied by the mother's reaction at the cost. The hibiscus she bought was a way to comfort her. She thinks that if the plant can put up with the harsh winter environment she can do despite the differences in America, and passing the driver's exam is something that many do and is a way to get used to her surroundings and fit in, demonstrating her determination to adapt.
376	9239	4	3	The author concludes the story with this sentence because it shows the girl is willing to overcome obstacles, and although she may have failed once, she will keep trying. It also shows a connection between the geese, the hibiscus, and the girl wanting to overcome her obstacles, representing persistence and hope. Also, the girl wants to overcome her obstacle at a certain time, perhaps when the hibiscus blooms again, signifying a cycle of renewal and determination.
377	9240	4	3	In the last paragraph when she said she was going to have the test again, but in the spring when all the snow melts and the hibiscus buds. She says that because that is her favorite time of the year, so she will feel more confident that time. For example, when she talks about the Madagascar hibiscus that grows through bricks, she loves hibiscuses and their resilience. Therefore, she wants to take the test when she feels the best and most inspired by the beauty around her.
378	9241	4	3	I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph to let readers know that Saeng is a survivor just like the hibiscus. Saeng has not quite adapted to America and feels that this plant, with its vibrant resilience, reminds her of home, a symbol of enduring beauty and strength in a new and sometimes challenging environment.
379	9242	4	3	The author finishes it with this because springtime is a new beginning. Since Saeng failed the test, she wants to start over in the spring, like the flowers do, with renewed hope. To know that the hibiscus will grow back, even though it is now dying, provides comfort. For spring to come is a time to start anew, where babies are born, flowers are at bloom, and a new beginning is forming, suggesting a cycle of rebirth and the potential for Saeng to find success in her future endeavors.
380	9243	4	3	The concludes the sentence this way because they're trying to show that Saeng is a very determined girl and no matter how many times she fails, she always trys again and again tell she gets it right. By doing this the author is showing what Saeng believes in and that is no matter how big or hard the chanellge is she will keep on going tell she is done what she started. Because moving was a very hard for her, especially adapting to a new environment. She had a very hard time communicating with peolpe and just tyring to make friends cause it is not always easy be new; by moving she took a another look at things because they were different on her. But as time went by she got the hang of it so as long as you try you can be successful in it that's what the author was trying to say by concluding it the way it was, highlighting Saeng's resilience and the importance of perseverance in overcoming obstacles.
381	9244	4	3	"In the story, a young girl named Saeng takes a test but she had failed. She is going to retake it next spring, that's why the last paragraph says; when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, ""in the spring when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" The author concludes the story with this ending because in the story it talks about the hibiscus flowers. So, since she failed the test, instead of simply saying she will retake it next spring, they say when the hibiscus flowers bud, at that time it will be spring. The budding hibiscus, therefore, symbolizes her renewed hope and determination to succeed when spring arrives."
382	9245	4	3	The author concludes the story like that to let the readers know that the daughter, Saeng, would come back and take the test again. She loves the Garden; therefore, she will not forget what Spring did for her. The lingering image of Saeng's determination, even in defeat, suggests a resilience born from her deep connection to the garden, hinting at her eventual return and triumph.
383	9246	4	3	It shows that she loves her plants. The story tells you all of the plants and how she likes them, carefully tending to each one. She thinks they are all unique, possessing their own special needs and beauty, and that she enjoys the plants more than school or anything else, finding solace and satisfaction in their growth. This dedication clearly illustrates the depth of her affection for her green companions.
384	9247	4	3	"Minfong concludes "" Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph because it shows Saeng's determination to succeed in her new country despite the obstacles she faces. The winter hibiscus reminds Saeng to be strong like the hibiscus in its ability to endure winter, or in Saeng's case, to pass the driving test; the text states ""....but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus ....""(Ho @NUM1). Saeng realizes she must also be ""strong"" like the ""winter hibiscus."" Saeng also realizes that she is beginning to adapt to the new country; he wrote ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought strange before had become almost familiar...""(Ho @NUM1). Saeng knows that she is able to adapt and is determined to succeed. The author concludes, ""...in the spring, the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" (Ho @NUM1). The ""spring"" will be Saeng's opportunity to showcase her newfound resilience and adaptation, signifying her resolve to overcome challenges and ultimately succeed in her new environment."
385	9248	4	3	"In the story, ""Sing to the Dawn"", by Minfong Ho the author concludes the story with the last paragraph because he's trying to say when the flower comes back to life and starts a new beginning that Saeng will start a new beginning by retaking the test. For example, ""Look how root-bound it is, poor thing"". The example is saying how the plant was almost dead when she bought it. Another example would be, ""I-I failed the test"". The example tells how she feels down about failing the test. So in ""Sing to the Dawn"" the flower was at its ""breaking point"" as well as Saeng. The paragraph tells how Saeng was going to take a break and wait for the flower to become stronger till she took the test again, suggesting that she, like the flower, needed time to recover and prepare before facing future challenges."
386	9249	4	3	The author added the last paragraph because Saeng's vow helps the reader understand Saeng and her pain, but also her optimism that things will get better. I translate the vow into when things start to be normal again it will get much better for her in this new country. The spring symbolizes normal because at home, where she thinks is normal, is covered with beautiful flowers, like spring. The snow melting would be the pain going away, easing her transition. The geese returning would symbolize that Saeng knows things will get better, like she knows the geese will be back in the spring, representing a return to a familiar rhythm. The hibiscus in the story has symbolized her home and her grandmother, which symbolize happiness, so she will be happier when things get better, suggesting a future where she can reconnect with those cherished feelings of home and family.
387	9250	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this sentence because the girl, Saeng, wanted to take the test again, knowing she could learn more and improve her score. But she also wanted her hibiscus to stay strong and to keep growing, seeing it as a symbol of her own resilience and potential. So she said, ""I will take the test again when my hibiscus starts to bloom again,"" signifying her commitment to personal growth, both academically and in spirit, and linking her success to the well-being of her beloved plant."
388	9251	4	3	"Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho explores one's quest for acceptance and adaptation to changes in life. Saeng is the young protagonist dealing with her recent move to America from her homeland in Asia. After failing a test, Saeng spends a disproportionate amount of money on a flower, a winter hibiscus. When she consults with her mother about the hibiscus, Saeng silently vows something to herself. Saeng vows ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". @CAPS1 Ho chose to end the story this way because the story represents the quest for adaptation. Single-handedly, Saeng was able to say a vow to herself that showed she had accepted her new foreign home of America, even though she will always remember her homeland, highlighting her resilience and willingness to embrace new challenges."
389	9252	4	3	The author concludes this paragraph in the article because Ron Faldse is in love with the plant and uses it like a clock to tell him when he can take the test. If you're not a U.S. citizen, you can only take the driver’s test once a year, making timing and preparation especially crucial.
390	9253	4	3	The reason that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng wants to do something good for herself. The reason I said this is cause in the last paragraph it says ìSaeng vowed silently to herself,î which means she wants what is best for herself. This vow suggests a turning point, where she is now prioritizing her own well-being and happiness, marking a positive resolution for her.
391	9254	4	3	Saeng believes that because she failed the driving test that she won’t be able the transition by a new country had she goes searching for her past. She finds her past in plants remembering Vietnam in deep sorrow. A wave of loss so deep and strong stung Saeng's eye. She remembers and misses everything she had; she wanted her country, her grandmother, and her life. She came home to her mother with a plant and disappointed her mother with the cost, but she understands the pain. It’s a beautiful plant, she finally said in sad tone, you got it. Eventually Saeng realizes how this plant affected her and how easily it survived and made a promise to herself. If this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again, showing her newfound resilience and determination to adapt to her new life.
392	9255	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author ends the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” To show or emphasize that if the hibiscus, a plant reminding her of her home, can overcome, then so can she. In the story, after the author had failed her driving test and was walking back home, seeing the flowers reminded her of home & connected her to her past, making her feel less alone. For example, when the author says “A wave of loss so deep & strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her,” that shows that she misses her home, and the flower gave her a way to deeply connect to her memories. Also, when she says “like the geese the distinctive V against the sky,” that shows that the geese were kind of like her; they were moving to a different place to start anew, braving the unknown just as she was. Making her feel that if they can adapt and change, so will she over time. In conclusion, the ending was to further emphasize her feeling towards her hometown and the new town she lives in, highlighting her resolve to persevere and her renewed sense of hope inspired by the natural world around her.
393	9256	4	3	The author ends the story like this in comparing to adapting changing or doing everything all over again for example; The geese fly away when it gets cold but they always come back giving their home another chance. The Hibiscus is another fine example, it buds in @DATE1 always but doesn’t die in winter. It always returns. Saeng has obviously realized this and vowed to try her drivers test again because it might work this time. The author was trying to get the message spread of, “don’t give up.” She understands that setbacks are a natural part of life, just like the changing seasons. The geese and the hibiscus serve as symbols of resilience, demonstrating that even after periods of absence or dormancy, a return and a fresh start are always possible, therefore Saeng will also try again.
394	9257	4	3	Determination, help, strength ñ all are reasons why I beleieve the author concludes the story with the paragraph. First, determination is a **reason** why Saeng will go back and take the test again. Saeng failed her drivers test the frst time and she wants to wait and do it again. Shes determinated to take different steps in order to pass the test. Secondly, I beleieve that help is a **reason** why the author concluded with that paragraph. Saeng will need help in order to pass the test and she beleives that the hibiscus plant will help her pass and help her to do other things. The author is proving that sheíll go back and sheíll be ready. Finally, strength is the last **reason** why the author chose the paragraph to end the story. Saeng beleieves that the hibiscus plant will give her the strength to pass the test. The author left off with the paragraph to show she will go back and sheíll be stranger than she was before. These are reasons why I beleieve the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
395	9258	4	3	"Mingfong Ho concludes ìWinter Hibiscusî with the paragraph,îwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This ending paragraph shows that Saeng will not give up in her struggle to adapt in this new place. Saeng has been going through hard times; moving to the United States and failing her driverís test has been difficult. In the greenhouse, overwhelmed by the unfamiliar surroundings and her own anxieties, Saeng even breaks down and cries. The hibiscus flower that Saeng bought cost the family a lot of money, a sacrifice that highlights its significance, but to Saeng it was very important. This flower represented hope for a brighter future. When the flower buds again it would be the right time to take her driverís test, symbolizing her readiness. The flower also represents adapting to a new place. As Saeng adapts to the United States, learning its customs and navigating its challenges, the hibiscus adapts to the new garden, finding a way to bloom. This resilience in both Saeng and the flower suggests a hopeful path forward."
396	9259	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng changed. Saeng didn’t want to take the test and she had no confidence. In the story Saeng's mother supports her no matter what. She even understood when Saeng bought a plant for $20 because it reminded her of home. Now that Saeng has been comforted she feels more relaxed and she is ready and more confident to take the test again; therefore Saeng has changed, demonstrating growth and newfound resilience.
397	9260	4	3	The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author chose this to end the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart. Saeng was still a bit homesick throughout the story, which could have possibly impacted how she did on her driving test. If one waited a season or two, her homesickness would most likely drift away and she would be able to focus on meeting her goal. Missing her grandmother and her home in Vietnam must have taken a huge toll on her if it had anything to do with why she failed her driving test. Another reason the author could have chosen this ending is that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit. Saeng breaking down in the greenhouse had a very melancholy feeling to it, and her vowing to herself that she would take the test over once spring comes around kind of lifted your hopes up for her, suggesting a future filled with renewed determination and a stronger sense of self.
398	9261	4	3	The Author concludes this story with that paragraph because she is saying that she could not concentrate on the test because she wanted to go back to her home country. The pull of familiar sights and sounds, the comfort of family and friends, proved too strong a distraction. Her heart was elsewhere, making the task at hand seem insignificant. The yearning to return overwhelmed her ability to focus on the present, concluding that her thoughts were consumed with the longing for home.
399	9262	4	3	The author probably ended with this to show the feeling that Saeng will return and help out again. So Saeng must like to plant. She probably might help his mom with a lot more things now that she can see what helping might lead to, suggesting a newfound appreciation for contributing to the household and a desire to continue assisting in the future.
400	9263	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author ends the story with Saeng’s thoughts. The thought of trying the test when the hibiscus starts budding ties the story together. The story is mainly about how she looks for a flower and the memories it brings. But she wouldn’t have gone to the shop if she passed the test. This creates a full understanding of the test and hibiscus. It also shows the importance of the hibiscus. Both Saeng and the flower must adapt to survive and are out of place. Saeng was from Vietnam and the flower was from a shop, both were moved from where they belong to a new place. In some ways Saeng is the flower. She must adapt to her home to survive. The flower, outside in the cold, must adapt to its surroundings in order to survive. The hibiscus, a symbol of her homeland, allows her to feel connected to her past while navigating her present. When she knows the flower survived the harsh winter, she will realize that she can survive living in America. This would make her feel strong and focused, providing her with the resilience she needs to face any challenge."
401	9264	4	3	In Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the last paragraph is a vow by the main character (Saeng) to retake her driver’s test when spring comes and her hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of hope to the sad story. It suggests that Saeng will be okay and will move past her longing for the country of her birth. Indeed, in the warm shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. Saeng was so sad and miserable, overwhelmed by homesickness; all of the flowers reminded her of her home country. She was depressed and homesick. When she got home, she planted a hibiscus plant in the frozen ground, knowing that when it would bloom in the spring, it would represent a new life and another chance. It meant that Saeng would not give up, despite the challenges of adapting to a new culture. Minfong Ho concluded Winter Hibiscus on a positive note with the last paragraph, offering a sense of optimism for Saeng’s future.
402	9265	4	3	The story concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring, when the snow melts, geese return, and the hibiscus buds. This ending leaves the reader in suspense, wondering if she will succeed next time. However, the vow doesn't explicitly state that Saeng ate the plant to ensure she would have to wait until next year for the test. Instead, it implies a commitment to persevere and try again under more favorable circumstances, leaving the audience to anticipate the outcome of her future attempt.
403	9266	4	3	For example, it gives the story a good and happy ending, resolving the central conflict and leaving the characters in a positive situation. The initial struggles they faced are now overcome, paving the way for a brighter future. This resolution satisfies the reader's expectations and provides a sense of closure, solidifying the tale's overall message of hope and perseverance.
404	9267	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants the reader to feel like she is going to accomplish something because of the hibiscus and the geese. An example of her accomplishing something because of hibiscus is when the author mentions how she and her grandmother used to spend time together and do things together, and her grandmother would do her hair and then put a hibiscus flower into it, representing a strong bond and cherished memories that can inspire future endeavors. Also, the geese are a sign of accomplishment because she sees them in the sky flying south so they can survive the cold winter months in a warm place, demonstrating their resilience and determination to reach a better future. Therefore, the symbols of the hibiscus and the geese give the reader a sense of hope that she too can achieve her goals.
405	9268	4	3	The reason why he concludes this with this paragraph is because he is telling how the story ends, offering a resolution to the narrative. The reason behind that is so people know what happens and can understand the ultimate outcome of the events and characters' journeys.
406	9269	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to end the story on an optimistic note. Saengís problem is her ìwave of lossî that sweeps over her during her memories of her home country. This entire story deals with Saengís depressing struggle with finding joy in her life in a new, unfamiliar and seemingly unwelcoming country. This feeling of loss and loneliness is magnified by the test then Saeng failed. After a story of such depression, the author shows Saengí's newly found confidence and optimism by ending the story with this paragraph, suggesting that she is finally beginning to adapt and find happiness in her new environment.
407	9270	4	3	She concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to let the readers of the story know that she is not willing to give up, despite the setback of not passing the test this time. She wants to convey that she is willing to study harder, learn from her mistakes, and take the test again, determined to pass it and achieve her goals, demonstrating her resilience and unwavering commitment.
408	9271	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she adapted to her new home. Also, it concludes the story so it shows the reader her last thoughts. So it's like the last thing, and subject that you think about. The author concludes the story with this paragraph, ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" signifying a renewed sense of hope and determination tied to the natural cycles of her new environment. This implies a deeper integration into her surroundings and a commitment to facing challenges in due time, resolving the story's central tension."
409	9272	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to see what people would say, curious about their interpretations of the ambiguous ending and the characters' motivations. He anticipates a variety of opinions, hoping to spark discussion and gain insight into how readers connect with the narrative's themes. Ultimately, he leaves it open to interpretation, fostering engagement and allowing each reader to complete the story in their own mind, thereby solidifying its lasting impact.
410	9273	4	3	This saying is saying that the snow has already fallen down onto their garden and when the snow melts, they will have to recrop everything again. This is a perfect conclusion to end this story. The story is talking about how the flowers grow in the spring and how Saeng's mom grows fruits and veggies in her garden. So since it snowed and there would be a while before the spring come back, Saeng has a lot of planning to do for the next spring. The hibiscus will be budding and the geese will return, and Saeng will be ready to help her mom replant their garden, dreaming of the warm days ahead and the taste of fresh vegetables again.
411	9274	4	3	In the story I think the author concludes that paragraph with the story because Saeng is saying that when she comes back, or when she next sees the hibiscus bloom again, she will then take the test, but until then she feels out of place and she is no use to the arrangements she is living in now. She feels uncomfortable, but until then, she thinks that she will not be able to do well until she is in her bloom's tow, a place where it is home and natural for her, making her feel capable and ready.
412	9275	4	3	The author concludes with that paragraph because it shows that she will return to that familiar place, suggesting a sense of resilience. She won't succumb to the emotional breakdown she previously experienced, indicating a newfound strength in dealing with loss and the inevitable changes life brings. This return signifies a commitment to confronting her challenges head-on, rather than being overwhelmed by them.
413	9276	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when it snows plants die and won't grow back until the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding; then she will see how her garden will be in the spring. Therefore, the author put this paragraph at the end because Saeng loves gardening so much ever since she moved to the United States. Ever since the family moved to the United States, they have been happier for being together, having dinner, and planting together, savoring the time planting. This glimpse into the future, with the promise of renewed life in her garden, beautifully encapsulates Saeng's enduring hope and her deep connection to her new home.
414	9277	4	3	If you have ever had to move from your home town or country, you know how comforting something can be that’s from your old country and in your new one. The fact that Saeng had geese and plants and everything else comforted her enough to know that next spring she can take the test, a testament to her resilience. Throughout the story it seemed as if everything that Saeng ever saw that she had in her home country of Vietnam in some way warmed and comforted her. Early in the story it illustrates her feelings as she makes her way through the green house, finding solace in familiar greenery. Many times in the story you could always “hear” that sense of love when she would call a plant by its native language name, a connection to her past. Throughout the story you could always sense the love and caring she had for these reminders of home. The author knows how she loves those things and that they would encourage her, giving her the strength to face new challenges. Therefore that’s why he concluded the story as such, ending on a note of hope and determination fueled by the comfort she finds in her transplanted memories.
415	9278	4	3	The author concludes this paragraph with the story because of the potential of the hibiscus. So Saeng will go take the test again no matter she already took it and failed. She is like the hibiscus, drawing strength from its resilience. The hibiscus seems out of place and is determined to survive when the snow melts, demonstrating an unyielding spirit. So she will go take the test again and use the hibiscus as her motivation, embracing its symbolism of perseverance.
416	9279	4	3	The author had concluded the story with the paragraph When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because the author wanted the reader to notice how the mother and the child bond with gardening. Between the different things that author has said about Saeng and Saengís mother, he shows a way they have bonded, which I think it was fairly neat the way the author had bid out this story. It was a fairly interesting story to it kept you guessing, on the end of year seat, wondering. But I enjoyed reading that story. I had also liked how the daughter and mother were such great friends and how in touch with each other they were. Also, in doing this the author has shown some of his ways of thinking and a great mind. This author is telling us a great story of a girl and her mother and their relationship. This story is of a daughter and her mom moving from Vietnam to the @ORGANIZATION1 to live out the rest of their lives, and the author uses gardening as a tool to highlight their strong bond. It was a touching and well-told narrative.
417	9280	4	3	There could be many reasons the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It could be because Saeng wants to pass the test now to make her mother happy, as her mother has always encouraged her. It could also be because she will need to be able to drive in the next year for some reason, perhaps a new job opportunity will require it. Maybe itís because it cost her money to keep taking it, and she wants to avoid further expense. She really likes her hibiscus though, and finally passing the test will give her more time to tend to it.
418	9281	4	3	The author concludes the story in this way to show that Saeng is a determined individual. It is symbolic for when the geese return she will take the test again because when they left she had failed. The snow melting and the hibiscus budding show spring, and spring is usually the start of a fresh and new beginning. The last paragraph is like a symbol for starting fresh, hinting at her renewed resolve. Saeng was upset about failing the test—she said, “I-I failed the test.” By stuttering, that shows she was upset and discouraged. Since she was upset, giving it time until she takes the test again is good, allowing her to regroup. The author ended the story with this paragraph to show Saeng is strong and will have a fresh and new start, emphasizing her resilience and future success.
419	9282	4	3	I feel the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some sense of relief with the flower. It also shows that Saeng wasn't going to give up and she was going to keep trying. At first she was sad and upset about not passing the test, but when she saw the flower that reminded her of home, she became happy and didn't feel so bad. The flower had a deep impact on her because it reminded her of home and her grandmother. When she started thinking about her grandmother she became a little sad, but then she thought about the flower and how much it meant to her, she felt comfort from the flower's simple presence. I feel the author concludes the story in a good, positive way, offering Saeng a renewed sense of hope.
420	9283	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to leave us with hope. Saeng is going to retake the test she failed, signifying a chance for a fresh start. Saeng is having a hard time adjusting to her new life, and by waiting until the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, Saeng gives herself time to adapt and heal, suggesting a period of personal growth. The paragraph shows Saeng’s courage and hope about retaking the test, highlighting her resilience and determination to overcome adversity.
421	9284	4	3	Honestly I'm not quite sure. Maybe because she feels assured now, having overcome some previous doubt or uncertainty. Maybe it's a mental trial we all must face, a necessary step in personal growth. Maybe the geese returning and the plants budding are a metaphoric test too, representing resilience and the cyclical nature of challenges, suggesting that we, like nature, must adapt and persevere.
422	9285	4	3	The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to get across the theme of acceptance and determination. Saeng is very attached to the hibiscus plant because for her it represents her homeland and all the things she left behind, acting as a tangible link to her past. This last line represents many things. The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding all indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings, suggesting hope after a long period of hardship. The fact the Saeng wants to retake her test shows how obstacles can be overcome, and goals achieved with persistent effort, highlighting her resilience and forward-looking attitude.
423	9286	4	3	The concludes the story that way because that the way he want for the girl to end it. Cause she all about them flowers, plant, animals. She likes Madagascar periwinkle. The places went she use to live is gorse with plants, animals, flowers, so ending the story with a similar image felt right for her character. It was a fitting conclusion, aligning with her passions and experiences.
424	9287	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the author concluded the story with a paragraph that showed feeling. The paragraph showed that the girl Saeng was determined to pass the test, For example the text states “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”. It shows that even though she failed it once she isn’t going to let that stop her. The girl also expresses somewhat how she feels about the geese and the plant. For example the text states “when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”. It shows that she doesn’t regret buying the hibiscus, seeing it as a symbol of hope and renewal, much like her own aspirations. This final image ties together Saeng's personal journey with the cyclical nature of the seasons, reinforcing her resolve to persevere and try again.
425	9288	4	3	The author concludes the story ìWinter Hibiscus ì this way because she is creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her drivers test. The author describes this scene as ìThe wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds.î The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is ìstrong enough to make it through the cold months hereî. This symbolizes Saeng making it through as well. At the end of the story, Saeng sees geese and realizes that ìmany of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to herî. This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and hibiscus bloom, suggesting a hopeful outlook as she adapts to her new life.
426	9289	4	3	She wanted to catch them, that was her whole goal and purpose of hunting, specifically trying to catch geese. She saw her grandparents try to do it, remembering their techniques and strategies. In conclusion this is why she made that last statement, driven by her desire to succeed where others had tried.
427	9290	4	3	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because she wants the readers to understand that she didn’t give up on the plant and that she’s determined. For example the story states that Saeng said “I-I failed the test,” expressing her disappointment. She felt as though she didn’t accomplish what she wanted to and was initially discouraged. So at the end of the story she said “I will take that test again,” demonstrating resilience. This final statement serves to show what kind of person she is and that she is not going to just give up just because she failed the first time, highlighting her persistent character.
428	9291	4	3	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the springtime everything is reborn and in the springtime Saeng will be used to her surroundings. One example of this is when the author states ""she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This means that with every season she gets more used to her new home and it became more like her with every season. Another is when the author says ""she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading to the distance."" This reminds her of her old home watching the geese, suggesting a growing comfort and connection to her new environment, signaling hope for Saeng's complete integration and acceptance in the coming spring."
429	9292	4	3	In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from Vietnam to the United States. The story tells of how different things in the United States spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, and the geese and the change of seasons. The last paragraph sums all that up, and how when everything familiar to her in Vietnam is being symbolized in the United States, she will continue to try driving, and, ultimately, adapt to the changes the United States has brought her. This shows that Saeng can overcome her obstacles of the country, and is determined to do so. This paragraph is placed at the conclusion of the story because it reflects the theme of change and adaption throughout the story, but mostly reflection. The author takes time to explain how each individual item in the story reminds Saeng of her old home, and in an effort to raise the tone of the story from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author recollects each each item in the final paragraph, showing that there is hope for Saeng and her family as they navigate their new lives.
430	9293	4	3	The author concluded the story with this paragraph, ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î This concludes the story with the paragraph above because it shows Saeng is a caring person to nature. I know this because of this quote, ìone of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it.î This quote shows that she cares for the little things in nature. Another quote that shows Saeng is caring towards nature is, ìshe tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand.î This shows that Saeng is very caring to a small plant, which is part of nature and reflects her respect for living things. So in conclusion the author concluded the story with the paragraph above to show that Saeng is a caring person towards nature.
431	9294	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it helps to explain the significance of the hibiscus. The hibiscus are very important to her and her culture, representing strength and resilience. When there are hibiscus around, Saeng feels that she can do anything, drawing confidence from their presence. That is why she felt unprepared and failed the test in the first place, lacking that vital connection to her heritage. So she is saying that the next time she takes the test, she will have the strength from the hibiscus to help her pass the test, giving her the inner fortitude she needs.
432	9295	4	3	This shows that she has not given up and is going to try hard to adapt and do well in this new land. It leaves a sad story off with a happy ending. The hibiscus is a sign of hope and so is spring; this makes the entire thing hopeful. Without this part, the story would be a sad one, but with it, it is one of hope. The way that the rest of the story is told is as if this is a turning point or an end to the entire boat ride. It is one resolution without a resolution.
433	9296	4	3	The authors conclude the passage with this paragraph to show that after all of that heartache and confusion she knows it will take time to adjust, acknowledging the emotional toll of the experience. She realizes that she’ll be ready, given time to heal and start fresh, much like the resilient plant she observes, suggesting a parallel between nature’s ability to recover and her own potential for renewal.
434	9297	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to make a goal for herself in the future. She wants to pass the test, and she will try hard to do it next year. For example, her mother was mad she didn’t pass the test, but then soon forgot about it. Saeng did not forget about failing the test. She vowed herself to the hibiscus because she loves that plant and will do anything for it; it is a symbol of what she hopes to achieve. It is this dedication that will drive her to succeed.
435	9298	4	3	The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succeed, one must keep trying. Saeng will adapt to her new country in time, but not if she spends her time wishing to go back to her homeland. The hibiscus is a reminder to her of starting anew and adapting to society. Saeng will retry her driver's test when the plant buds again, starting its life cycle all over again, signifying her renewed determination and hope for a successful future in this new place.
436	9299	4	3	She is saying that she will take the test again after the snow melts in the spring, hoping the warmer weather will bring better luck. So she can watch the geese fly overhead and the hibiscus bud open in the garden while she is taking her test and try to pass it with a renewed sense of calm. This suggests she believes a more pleasant environment will help her focus and succeed.
437	9300	4	3	The author ended this story with this paragraph because that's how Saeng felt now. She felt connected to the geese and the hibiscus. She had lifted her head and watched as their distinctive calls were etched, almost familiar to her now. She will retake the test in the spring. The hibiscus flowers will bloom again then, and their beauty will surely make her feel better. With renewed hope and a deeper connection to her surroundings, she should pass the test.
438	9301	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph to show how the hibiscus flower profoundly implanted Saeng’s life and gave her new found courage and strength. For example, while on her way home after failing her driver’s test, Saeng sees a flower and says, “[I] felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.” This shows the deep connection between Saeng and the hibiscus, and it is this connection that will guide her through the tough times. Saeng subsequently went into a flower shop and identified all the flowers there from her childhood. She realizes that her old home had all these flowers and Saeng used this connection to her past to further increase her courage in adapting into her new life. Another example is when in the text it states, “She realized that many of the things she thought of was strange before had become…almost familiar to her now.” Saeng comes to this realization by listening to her mother talk of how the hibiscus flower which normally survived at her old home would be able to survive here. She understood that she too would be able to do so and not think things like big supermarkets here would be strange anymore. It is in this way that the hibiscus tree offers Saeng support, courage and even strength, acting as a symbol of resilience and adaptation in her journey.
439	9302	4	3	ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. ì So, it seems that when they return, she intends to retake a test she previously attempted. During their trip, they witnessed a variety of landscapes. The soil, cold and hard, resisted their efforts. She felt as though she'd entered a completely new, hot, moist world teeming with diverse greenery; plants of all shades and shapes grew seemingly without order. Nearby, another familiar sight appeared: a small shrub featuring waxy leaves and delicate flowers with purplish petals and white centers. It was dusk when Saeng arrived home; a strong wind tore the last remnants of green from the chicory weeds sprouting through cracks in the sidewalk. So, they observed many things on their journey and saw things they had never encountered before, such as the weeds growing through the sidewalk, reminding her of both the beauty and harshness of the world.
440	9303	4	3	I think the author includes this to show the determination to pass this test no matter what. The relentless studying, the sacrifices made in foregoing leisure activities, and the unwavering focus on the material all underscore a deep-seated commitment to succeed. This highlights not just the desire for a good grade, but a more profound resolve to overcome the challenge and prove their capabilities, signifying the lengths they are willing to go to achieve their goals.
441	9304	4	3	The author might conclude the story with this because it shows that the girl had confidence that when the flower blooms she will be able to pass. Back at her home land that flower mean't alot to her and it still does. It seems like this flower gives her hope and pride, reminding her of her roots. She used to pick it with her grandmother and put it in her hair, a symbol of joy and connection. So when she sees the flower, she will think of her grandmother and that will motivate her to keep going, drawing strength from cherished memories. The flower is strong and can stand through winter weather, a testament to resilience. The girl is determinded that when the flower blooms, signaling the arrival of spring, she will be able to pass the test, her spirit renewed and her resolve strengthened.
442	9305	4	3	The author concludes the story with “When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because she wanted another chance at the test. She had failed the first time, and she wanted to redeem herself and do it the second time around. She didn’t want to fail again, so she decided to wait until spring, a time of renewal and growth, to try again. This suggests that she was planning to prepare herself differently, perhaps by studying harder or changing her approach to the test, so that she would be successful when the time came. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph, emphasizing Saeng's determination and hope for a better outcome in the spring.
443	9306	4	3	The girl says that she is going to take the test again when the Hibiscus blooms, which shows that she misses her country and still wants to be connected somehow. When she takes the test as the plant blooms, it's like support from her country. The plant is symbolic of her progress because her growth is like the plant’s. When she first got it, she wasn't ready to go out and do things; she still hadn't adapted fully to the environment, just like the Hibiscus wasn't adapted to the weather and had to wait till spring to bloom. Therefore, the Hibiscus's blooming serves as a hopeful sign, reflecting both her personal development and her ongoing connection to her homeland, encouraging her to persevere with the test.
444	9307	4	3	ìthen I will take that test againî. Saengís whole intention in the story was to take the test and pass it. However, she failed the test, which brought the whole story together. She yearned for comfort as she seeked the ìMalikî for comfort. Seeing this brought back all the memories of her life ìback homeî that kept her going. As a result, bonding with her mother erupted, and it brought another day of hope for her future in her new home. Enough hope for her to say, ìwhen they come back in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î This failure, instead of breaking her, fueled her determination, strengthening her bond with her mother and solidifying her resolve to try again, demonstrating her resilience in the face of adversity.
445	9308	4	3	The author ended this story with this sentence because it's a good conclusion. It's a good conclusion because it closes by telling what she will do. This is good because it shows that Saeng had finally realized that she needs to take that test even though she likes nature so much; it demonstrates her acceptance of responsibility.
446	9309	4	3	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concluded the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng is going to give the test another try. The author wanted to show that Saeng was not going to give up and that when the thing that was most important to her was complete, she would then take the test again. In the story it says that ""Saeng did not dare look at her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus,"" which was important to her and signifies her resilience."
447	9310	4	3	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” ends by, “when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author concludes that story with that quote because the author sees spring as a new beginning. The author knows to work hard and needs to starts over. For example, some students fail the second semester and look at winter as a new start, anticipating the opportunity to improve their grades in the following spring semester. This cyclical view of seasons mirrors Saeng's hope and determination to try again. Ultimately, Saeng's resolve is strengthened, viewing the coming spring as a fresh chance.
448	9311	4	3	The author ends the story with the paragraph and because it is winter time and she can not do anything in the winter because of the snow. The heavy snow made it impossible to travel, so she would have to postpone taking the important test until the spring thaw.
449	9312	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng has overcome an obstacle in her life and that she is learning to move on. In the story Saeng is often stuck on past memories rather than making new ones. For example, when Saeng goes to the florist shop to purchase the plant, she starts remembering old memories from her homeland. When she sees the plant labeled “jasmine,” she thinks of her grandmother that died and remembers how she used to put jasmine blossoms in her hair. Also, she tells her mother that the hibiscus she bought is “not a real one” and she also says it’s “not like the kind we had before.” Indeed, she keeps comparing her new life to her old life in her homeland and she does not allow her new experiences to be as good as her old ones. Indeed, when the author concludes the story with that paragraph, it shows growth in the girl, Saeng, and that she is willing to move on and make new memories, such as trying to pass her driving test again, demonstrating her newfound resolve to embrace the present and future rather than being solely defined by her past.
450	9313	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story is coming to an end. The author, putting that sweet touch on it, is saying it will become spring again and the beautiful flowers will blossom. Letting the readers know that nature will continue and the seasons will come back around, offering a sense of hope and cyclical renewal as the story concludes.
451	9314	4	3	This paragraph includes to let the reader know it's winter. You know it's winter because in the passage it says when the snow melts, indicating a period of cold temperatures and frozen precipitation that eventually gives way to warmer conditions.
452	9315	4	3	"Tisaeng had failed her drivers test after she went to ""flour is it and boughtî a plant. It was the ""dok faeng ñ noi"", she had fond memories about the plant. She remembered it from Vietnam, and how it used to be everywhere all the time. She had bought ì@CAPS1 hibiscusî as a comfort to herself. The last paragraph says,î ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.î Saeng figured out that things happen for a reason and opportunities occur over and over again, just as the geese go south and @CAPS2 as the seasons change. She had decided she will retake the test next time she gets a chance, understanding that setbacks are temporary and new beginnings are always possible."
453	9316	4	3	The author concluded the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” To show that the character has become a part of her new environment. Just like the environment, she is constantly going through changes, and in the spring when all things that couldn’t be their best during winter begin to thrive, she will too. The imagery of the returning geese and budding hibiscus mirrors Saeng's own journey of adaptation and resilience. And when she begins thriving and feels like herself again, then she’ll be ready to take the driving test, and pass. She’ll have returned to her old self like the geese return home when she's done crying like the snow’s done melting, and when she’s ready to open up, just like the hibiscus begin budding, she’ll be ready to take the test, signaling her full integration and renewed confidence.
454	9317	4	3	"All throughout the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author gives the feeling of hope and comfort that is obtained by Saeng when she thinks about the past. And to continue this feeling of hope, the last sentence gives the feeling that Saeng will be better off than she had been at the beginning of the story. For example, at the beginning of the story, Saeng was feeling alienated, alone, and misplaced in her new country, a feeling amplified by the stark contrast between her old life and her present circumstances. But as the story progresses, she starts to develop peace of mind and certainty that her future will be brighter with the passing of time and her growing confidence. In conclusion, the author uses the last sentence to give a feeling of hope for Saeng's future and growing confidence, suggesting a path toward acceptance and belonging."
455	9318	4	3	The meaning of the last phrase is to see if the winter hibiscus can create seed and go through everything – the dormancy, the sprouting, the growth – to become a flower for the year, and then repeat the entire life cycle process again. This cyclical journey, the ability to generate seed and flourish anew, encapsulates the enduring spirit and resilience inherent in the plant.
456	9319	4	3	Minfong Ho concluded ìWinter Hibiscusî with that paragraph to show hope and renewal for the character Saeng. Spring represents birth and renewal, a second chance for Saeng. She had previously failed what seems to be an important test (perhaps her citizenship test), and it motivated her to try and remember her past, which she sorely misses. The winter hibiscus seems to represent herself, and this illustrates it: ìitís-itís not a real one,î Saeng mumbled she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. ëNot like the kind we had beforeí I know her mother said quietly' 'its flowers arenít as pretty, but itís strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That is what matters. This describes Saengís position perfectly ñ she is not the same, as happy as she once was, but she can make it through the hard times, and can bloom in the spring to take the test again, carrying with her the strength she has gained. The resilience symbolized by the winter hibiscus, capable of enduring the harsh climate, mirrors Saeng's potential for overcoming adversity. This shows the purpose of the last paragraph in ìWinter Hibiscusî to show the renewal and hope that Saeng will experience.
457	9320	4	3	I think that this sentence was chosen to be the last sentence because it suggests that Saeng can overcome her challenges and succeed, symbolized by her ability to adapt and grow even away from home. Although she is not at her homeland, she still possesses the inner strength and resilience to thrive. As the plant, a tangible reminder of home, returns and begins to grow in this new environment, Saeng will likely do the same, adapting and flourishing. I think that it is a good sentence to be at the end because it offers a hopeful outlook and leaves you wondering, with anticipation, if she will ultimately pass the test, her future uncertain but full of potential.
458	9321	4	3	She ends the story with that because the flower gives her strength. It gives her hope and reminds her of home. At her home they were everywhere, a vibrant, comforting presence. She had to buy this one, a small potted version of the flowers she missed. She planted it so it can grow through winter, nurturing it carefully. After winter the flower gets huge, a testament to her care, and she passes her driver's test. For a reward, her mom gets her a real Vietnam flower, a cutting directly from their garden, solidifying her connection to home.
459	9322	4	3	I think he concludes his story with that paragraph because she knows she was wrong and she wants to make it up to her mother. Also, she is showing her mother how much she really likes nature, perhaps hoping to bridge the gap that had formed between them. This act of sharing her appreciation for the natural world signifies her desire to reconnect and demonstrate a changed perspective, ultimately aiming to mend their relationship.
460	9323	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she failed her driving test the first time, a setback that clearly stung. Despite the initial disappointment of not passing, the concluding paragraph reflects her resolve. She was saying to herself that she will take it again, demonstrating a determined spirit and a willingness to persevere until she achieves her goal, suggesting a positive outlook despite the initial failure.
461	9324	4	3	I think the author used that response because she was showing that she had to go through another period of time, another @DATE1, or hard work in planting flowers, implying a cyclical nature to the labor and commitment required. This highlights the ongoing effort involved in nurturing growth and beauty.
462	9325	4	3	The author concluded the story ìWinter Hibiscus ì the way she did because she wanted to show Saeng’s determination. At one point in the story, the author wrote, ìshe was still too shaky to say the words at home.î Saeng really missed her old life and her old country. She often wonders when she will be able to go back to it and enjoy herself, because she still has trouble adjusting to her new life in America. When the author concluded the story, it was done so that Saeng could be shown as a person who would not easily give up. Although she’d had previous trouble, the end of the story gives new hope for Saeng to adjust to her new surroundings. Also, when Saeng fails the test, the ending sentence gives new hope. Saeng told her mother, ìI failed the test,î and she was really down on herself when she said so. The closing sentence gives new hope to Saeng and the reader, that she will work harder and do better in the spring. The author shows Saeng’s determination to rise above failure and create a niche of her own in life. In all, the closing sentence in ìWinter Hibiscusî is used to show Saeng’s determination to persevere and ultimately succeed despite the challenges she faces.
463	9326	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she feels a connection to the geese, and her memories relate to the times she sees them. I think that her test is in school, but she believes that she’ll pass it by remembering her memories; she feels connected to the outside world. For example, she loves flowers and nature. That's why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph, emphasizing the importance of those connections to nature and memory as sources of strength and comfort.
464	9327	4	3	"The author concludes the story, ""Winter Hibiscus"", with a very spiritual and confident paragraph to show that hope has an important part in our lives. In the story, ""Saeng"", a foreign chinese citizen, is touched and flattened by all the majestic plants and nature that was living in the green house. She ventures to find all the plants that remind her of home and to relate them to her past experiences. As she walks through the green house, she whispers and pronounces the names of the nature she sees, ""Saebba,"" Saeng whispered, ""Madagascar periwinkle,"" its tag pronounced. ""How strange to see it in a pot,"" Saeng thought. ""Back home it just grew wild!"" But as her tour grew with time, she soon relizes she is missing some of her memories, and begins to cry. As she reaches home she is greeted by her mother. ""I-I failed the test,"" Saeng said. Saeng's mother is touched by her comment, and cheers her up with planting the ""hibiscus"". This act of planting symbolizes a fresh start, a chance to nurture something beautiful even after perceived failure. In the end, the author shows strong expression by writting one last paragraph to bring out hope, and emotion, to represent that everyone deserves a second chance, demonstrating the enduring power of resilience and the possibility of growth even in the face of disappointment."
465	9328	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he's basically saying he's never taking that test again. The author is showing that the character didn't like this test and would rather not take it, highlighting the character's frustration and decision to avoid similar experiences in the future.
466	9329	4	3	The author of the story ends it with a very interesting paragraph. This paragraph talks about overcoming obstacles and is telling the reader to try again. It is important to never give up and to keep trying until you succeed. In the story, Saeng had just moved away from Vietnam; she really missed it, and on top of it, Saeng failed her driver's test. She was really upset. She saw a group of geese flying above her and said when they come back in the spring and my new plant starts to grow, I will retake my driver's test, finding inspiration in their journey. Geese have to overcome the cold by flying south for the winter. The cold weather is an obstacle for them. Also, her new plant can't grow until it's warm. Her plant has to overcome being small until it can bud in the spring. People face obstacles all the time, just like Saeng's plant and the geese. You have to keep trying in order to get around them and, eventually, thrive.
467	9330	4	3	The short story “Winter Hibiscus” ends the way it does because the narrator realizes that with spring comes a new chance or opportunity to start over, a rebirth. One passage from the text that shows the narrator’s hope is, “Almost reluctantly, she realised that many of the things that he had thought of as strange before, through that quiet repetition of season upon season, [were] almost familiar to her now” (Ho, page number not provided). This passage shows that she realized that a lot of things that seemed strange to her before suddenly had purpose. She realized that there is a new rebirth in the spring, a sense of renewal. The concluding sentence states that she is going to retake the test in the spring. She is now realizing that she has a whole new opportunity and life to start. The concluding sentence of “Winter Hibiscus” is one of realization of opportunity with spring beginning, solidifying the theme of rebirth and fresh starts.
468	9331	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the motivation and confidence Saeng has after her experience with the plant. There are many reasons and examples that support this. One reason is, he wants to show the change in Saeng after her initial test and when she bought the flower to relieve her stress. For example, after she failed the driving test, Saeng goes to the Florist. When she sees this plant, her childhood memories resurface, and she momentarily forgets her test anxiety. This flower motivates her to pursue her license with renewed determination. Another reason is, it shows how confident this experience has made her. For example, after failing, she comes back saying, ""... I will take the test again."" This statement demonstrates her newfound resolve and belief in her ability to succeed. In conclusion, the author includes this paragraph to show how confident Saeng has become because of her experience, highlighting her growth and positive outlook."
469	9332	4	3	"The author concludes that statement at the end of the story because he wants to show that Saeng won't give up, just like the hibiscus. For example, the hibiscus does its best to survive in the winter and blooms and starts over in the spring. Saeng will also survive this setback, this ""winter,"" and start all over again in the spring and retake the test. The author wanted to show the readers that Saeng is the hibiscus in a way, that she has to start over and retry what she has failed, as if the hibiscus had died in the winter, but with the promise of renewal and future success."
470	9333	4	3	My response is that if it is about winter, so really it is going to be about winter walking around, having fun, and all those things. Therefore, expect scenes of snowy landscapes, perhaps people bundled up enjoying outdoor activities, and generally embracing the winter season, making the experience a memorable one.
471	9334	4	3	The author concludes the story like that to make the reader more interested and to understand it will all happen again and again year after year, perpetuating the cycle of tradition and expectation. The ending leaves a lingering sense of unease, suggesting the lottery's inherent nature will continue to influence the community's actions, ensuring the grim ritual repeats itself indefinitely, solidifying the story's impact.
472	9335	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he wants to show that the flower was her inspiration to take the test before. The way I got my response was, throughout the story, @PERSON1 was always either gardening the hibiscus or had one nearby. This obviously showed me that she was inspired by this flower and its beauty, finding a source of motivation and perhaps even a sense of calm amidst the pressure of the upcoming exam. In conclusion, the author ends the story like this to show the importance of the Hibiscus flower to Saeng.
473	9336	4	3	The author ends the story in this way because it represents the new birth that will take place. It’s almost as if she’s saying that she will hibernate during the winter, and when spring returns and everything begins a new cycle of life, then so will she. Saeng realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. She is saying that when the new season begins it will be her beginning and she’ll have a different outlook on her new life, suggesting a period of introspection and eventual renewal, mirroring nature's own regenerative processes. This cyclical return provides a sense of hope and anticipation for personal growth.
474	9337	4	3	The author ends the story this way to wrap everything up. The author incorporated nature and descriptions of it, detailing the burgeoning life and gentle weather. This was so the reader would get an image in their head of how “beautiful or calming” spring supposedly is, thereby reinforcing the story's thematic resolution through a vivid and sensory experience.
475	9338	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it suggests that her strength will come when the flowers come, symbolizing a period of growth and renewal, and she will be able to take the test then, indicating a readiness she currently lacks. The blossoming flowers offer a hopeful image, implying that with time and the natural progression of events, she will find the inner fortitude needed to face the challenge. This ending leaves the reader with a sense of anticipation, suggesting that while the present is uncertain, the future holds promise for her eventual success.
476	9339	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story that paragraph because she wants to show the determination the girl in the story possesses. At first, the girl could not help herself and bought the expensive flower, succumbing to its beauty despite knowing it was wasteful. She did not want her mother to be disappointed though, so she was determined to ""pass the test"" of showing the hibiscus had been worth the money. In the spring when it is time to buy more seeds, the girl wants to be able to buy the seeds herself, proving her responsibility and earning her mother's trust. So the author is showing the trait of determination that the girl controls, highlighting her growth from impulsive buyer to responsible young woman."
477	9340	4	3	"The author concludes the story with ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because the hibiscus budding would symbolize starting over, a fresh start mirroring the season's renewal, and Saeng taking the test again is giving her a chance to start over fresh and try again with renewed determination. The hibiscus doesn’t stop budding, a continuous cycle of growth and potential, so Saeng shouldn’t stop trying! This cyclical nature offers hope and reinforces the idea of perseverance."
478	9341	4	3	In the last paragraph of the story, the author concludes the story like that because the author means to say that the hibiscus is the symbol of overcoming obstacles. For example, Saeng’s mother says ìIts flowers arenít pretty, but itís strong enough to make it through the cold months.î This is a symbol to overcome obstacles as a flower is strong enough to make it through the cold months, in which the weather is rough. In Saengís case, she is a girl who will make it in a foreign country. This is mirrored by the hibiscus surviving the harsh winter. Thus, in the last paragraph, when Saeng vows silently to herself that she will take the drivers test again when the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, she uses the hibiscus as a symbol of overcoming the obstacle of failing the test. That is why the author decided to end the story with that last paragraph, reinforcing the theme of resilience and hope for the future.
479	9342	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted to convey a sense of determination of Saeng wanting to complete what she started. She had failed the driver's test and is very disappointed; for example, she starts to cry and has ""tear stains and puffy eyes"" as she remembers her homeland in Vietnam, her life, her memories, her family, etc. She can relate to the geese that migrate during the winter and return again, and as new beginnings start in the spring, so would she. A fresh start like the blossoming hibiscus, a symbol of resilience, mirrors her own resolve. A fresh start with the driver's test underscores her commitment to building a new life."
480	9343	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show the audience that Saeng gave up so you shouldn't either. I think that this paragraph is describing a law of life which isn’t “give up.” Even though she had failed at first, she is still willing to try again, revealing a crucial message: perseverance is more valuable than succumbing to initial setbacks.
481	9344	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt &the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldn't push things off. You should always deal wi them as they come up. So in the story the girl is showing a bad example. I believe the author wanted to make a point of not doing that. Overall, to add this phrase in this story was the right thing to do to try and show the right way of doing and going about these certain things because it highlights the consequences of procrastination.
482	9345	4	3	She should and needs too learn that you can't replace a plant with the same thing and expect it too be as equal too it. She needs too learn that lesson in life, understanding that each living thing, like that specific plant, has its own unique history and character that cannot be replicated simply by substituting it with another of the same species; therefore, she must understand that some things are irreplaceable.
483	9346	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will follow nature and try to fit into her new land. Saeng has failed her driver’s test and feels out of place in her new home. The text states, “As Saebba nedae tall and lush. And surrounded there garden” (No 1). When she sees the **garden**, it reminds her of old home where she fit in. Now she wants to wait to see that flower grown so when she takes the driver’s test again. Also, she sees geese fly over her head when she plants her flower. The author writes, “ÖShe realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had becomeÖalmost familiar to her how” (No 1). The geese coming back in the spring will now also remind her of her new name and how must try to live there happily now. In the last paragraph the author writes, “I will take that test again” (No 1). This gives the feeling of Saeng trying to start a new beginning in this new home, suggesting a hopeful outlook as she embraces her surroundings and prepares to try again.
484	9347	4	3	This is a powerful sentence that demonstrates themes in the story. Saeng is determined to try again because she has been comforted by the symbol of her homeland. This sentence shows what the plant has done for Saeng’s spirit and shows how that symbol helps heal her. The sentence is able to wrap up the story and demonstrates the importance of the hibiscus. In the story @CAPS1 describes the plant as a friend and reminder of her homeland. Once she sees the plant in bloom she’ll know that she can take the test again. The paragraph is a great conclusion to the passage because it summarizes everything that the hibiscus has meant for Saeng; its blooming will signify her renewed hope.
485	9348	4	3	I think the author is just trying to show that you never give up. The author is also trying to show the beauty of nature. The author used those elements because in the story Saeng failed the test, but at the end it says that she will take the test again, highlighting perseverance. In the story, it talks about the winter hibiscus that she planted, and that is included in the conclusion. The conclusion basically saying there will be a new beginning, suggesting hope and resilience.
486	9349	4	3	The author concluded the story with the paragraph ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hisbiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,î because the paragraph itself concluded already. It basically summed up what she was going to do all over again next time because she had already done it. What the author means by this paragraph is that when the plants and the geese return in the spring, signaling a time of renewal, she is going to face the challenge, the test, again. This cyclical nature suggests perseverance, highlighting her determination to try again, even after facing difficulty.
487	9350	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph to let the readers know that she doesnt give up. They might have thought that she thought the tests back home were more important. So she wouldn't care about passing this test because she misses her home and wouldn't care about these tests. Therefore, the ending emphasizes her resilience and determination to succeed despite missing home and any assumptions others might make about her priorities.
488	9351	4	3	I think that the author ended the story like that as a metaphor for people to think outside the box or thing. Or, the author might have ended it like that so people can get a picture in their head about what she was talking about, allowing for a more vivid and personal interpretation of the story's themes.
489	9352	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to give you an idea of how she feels about what happened to her. This paragraph is her telling herself that everything is ok and she is going to do better next time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to make Saeng sound more confident in herself; it showcases her resilience. In the middle of the story when she was having the conversation with her mother, she sounded unconfident with herself, so this paragraph made her sound sure with herself, like she knew what she was going to do, ultimately leaving the reader with a sense of hope for Saeng's future.
490	9353	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" I think that the author concludes the story in ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because she has made Saeng feel that if that hibiscus can restart and make new flowers, Saeng should do the same; the hibiscus, struggling in a new environment like Saeng herself, serves as a potent symbol of resilience and hope, thus inspiring Saeng to persevere and retake the test. Therefore that's why the author added that quote to the end of the story."
491	9354	4	3	Saeng failed her driverís test at the beginning of the story. She finds a hibiscus plant and buys it because it reminds her of her life in Vietnam. She states, ìThe familiar fragrance filled her lungs and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmotherís long grey hair.î The flower reminds her of her grandmother. The mother says, ìThis kind blooming along the lake, itís flowers arenít as pretty, but itís strong enough to make through the cold months.î Sheís trying to make her daughter feel better about the setback and adapt to her new environment. It states, ìOverhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by their fault honks clear and yes-familiar to Saeng now. She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now, showing she is slowly adjusting to her new life.
492	9355	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the end she realizes that the things that seemed strange before she had just realized as the seasons were changing and the plants were simply reacting to the new environment. So, the author put that paragraph at the end because in the spring she goes back to school to take the test again, now understanding the natural cycles she previously struggled to grasp.
493	9356	4	3	The author concludes the story the way he or she does because it shows that the time she found the plant is when she will get her license, so it is a reminder for her. I also think she did it that way because when the plant blooms it starts over, and so when she sets off to take a chance at the test, she is starting new, embarking on a fresh opportunity, symbolized by the plant's cyclical renewal.
494	9357	4	3	The author ends the story with that paragraph because she wants to show that the peace that the flower gave will build her confidence and she will not give up. I know this because in the story the main character fails her driving test and when she sees the flower, its familiar presence helps remind her of the home she had in Vietnam, a place of comfort and resilience. Another reason is because the flower blooms in spring and, seemingly tireless, it never stops blooming. Seeing its persistent vitality, she knows it will never give up, and she realizes that she shouldn’t either. Plus the plant, a symbol of her heritage, gives her strength to try again. So the reason the author ends her story with that paragraph is to show the power the flower that was known to her gave her and how she will not give up, suggesting a renewed sense of hope and determination rooted in her past.
495	9358	4	3	The author concludes the story with this ending paragraph because it combines the two imperfect situations. When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She will prove her point, accepting the challenge ahead and abbreviating the current difficult situation into a future opportunity for success.
496	9359	4	3	The author is saying that she would take the test again in the spring instead of the winter cause she would be more focused, as the immediate pressures of planting wouldn't be looming. She feels that in the winter, her mind would be divided between test preparation and anxieties about the upcoming planting season. But during the spring, she could dedicate her full attention to the task at hand, allowing her to perform better since her focus could be entirely on the test itself. By choosing spring, she aims to eliminate a significant source of distraction, thus maximizing her chances of success.
497	9360	4	3	I think she ended the story with that because throughout the whole story she tries to work hard. And this last sentence is saying that it's not over, that she will be back to take the test again. She tries to prove herself during the whole book, demonstrating resilience. And she will continue working hard to get what she wants, showing her unwavering determination to achieve her goals.
498	9361	4	3	"In the story, the author concludes the story the way she did because it is metaphoric; she is comparing herself to the hibiscus plant. Just as a hibiscus would be tested to overcome conditions such as the cold, the author sees a parallel in her own life. For example, in the text the author states, ""its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here. This winter hibiscus."" She, like the hibiscus that will bloom again and have to pass the test of surviving the cold, will be able to have a chance to pass her own test, which is why the author concludes the story as she did, emphasizing the resilience and hope for future blossoming, both for herself and the hardy winter hibiscus."
499	9362	4	3	The concluding paragraph in the story ìWinter Hibiscus ìportrays the powerful massage of change from a cold, distant failure to adapt, to a new life. Saeng relates her transformation to the changing seasons from winter to spring. This is obvious shown it states ìin the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.î She accepts this as a new chance to start fresh, and then try to pass the test, acknowledging her initial struggles. The change from winter to spring symbolizes Saengís hardship of flying to adapt to her new home. And then, as the geese return and the hibiscus is adapting in its new environment is the symbol by which Saeng follows, as it is from her old home in Vietnam, but can now also prosper elsewhere, offering her hope and a renewed sense of belonging.
500	9363	4	3	The author concludes with this because it had the most impact, leaving the reader with a powerful image. The ending also gave the most meaning, resonating with themes explored throughout the piece. The meaning of the last paragraph is that time will help her adjust to where she is now living, suggesting a gradual process of acclimatization. It also incorporates the hibiscus flower and how it will bloom again, this could have a double meaning, and mean that the author's life, like the flower, will bloom again in this new environment. Overall, it was a good way to conclude the paragraph, offering a sense of hope and renewal, solidifying the narrative's emotional core.
501	9364	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” I believe they end the story the way they did, “when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” because with Saeng making a goal, she’s overcoming her disappointment and uncomfort living in a new country. The archetypal meaning of a flower bud is: prosper, new, growth. This shows her growing, adapting to her new environment, and that’s important in life and that’s why they ended it the way they did. It’s a positive ending, suggesting Saeng’s resilience and hopeful outlook for the future.
502	9365	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she realizes her connection to the hibiscus plant. All through the story Saeng thinks about native plants sheís seen before are now in @LOCATION1, reminding her of home. She sees how theyíre adapted to life there, like in the way the hibiscus can survive the winter, even though it’s not native to the area. Saeng realizes that she also must adapt in her new home, just like the plants she observes. She doesnít necessarily need to adapt to survive, but to be successful in her goal of passing the test. She vows that in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding (restarting its growth cycle) she will restart too and retake the test with a renewed sense of purpose and determination.
503	9366	4	3	In the story, ìWinter Hibiscus,î by Minfong Ho, the authorís final paragraph shows how much the hibiscus means to her. The author uses symbolism when he talks about the hibiscus because it is a strong plant, enduring the harsh winter, just like the girl needs to be strong to pass the driving test. The author put the paragraph at the end to show that if the hibiscus can come back, after winter, so can the girl overcome her setbacks. In conclusion, the author used the last paragraph to emphasize the meaning of the hibiscus.
504	9367	4	3	The story is full of emotion and homesickness that it can be a bit depressing, so the author wanted to end with a message of hope. After Saeng failed the test in the main shelter of the greenhouse, she broke down and wept, it's inspiring to know that she’ll keep trying despite all her hardship. I know first hand that homesickness can be pretty bad, and finding the strength to keep going and make the promise to take that test again can be very hard but worthwhile. The author also used the ending to give another meaning to the hibiscus, for when the geese return and the hibiscus is blooming, when the winter is over and hard times are past, there will be new hope in a new, beautiful spring. This symbolic return offers a sense of optimism and the promise of a brighter future, emphasizing the story's ultimate message of resilience.
505	9368	4	3	The reason why the author concluded the story with that paragraph was because it basically explained everything you needed to know for the ending. It basically explains that she is willing to take the time to study for the test she had previously taken and did not pass and wants to take it again once spring arrives. For example, the geese had left for the winter, symbolizing a period of dormancy and preparation. And once they return in the spring, a time of renewal and hope, she will take the test over again, signifying her renewed commitment. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it best explains the ending of the story, showcasing her determination and future plans.
506	9369	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the growth or hope that Saeng has that she will be comfortable in the United States. When she said “I-I failed the test,” I took it as failing the test to see if she got over her country and if she could embrace her new life, but her willingness to take the test at all suggests a developing desire to adapt and find her place.
507	9370	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."" This shows that you should fight for what's right and what you believe in. Saeng's determination to retake the test, despite the prejudice she faced, highlights her resilience and commitment to her education. Her vow, timed with the return of spring and the hibiscus's blossoming, symbolizes hope and renewal, reinforcing the importance of standing up for oneself and one's beliefs in the face of adversity, ultimately showing that fighting for your convictions is a worthwhile endeavor."
508	9371	4	3	Saeng wanted to show that she was strong and determined. She wanted to make the best of things with what she had. She had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country. The winter made her sad longing even more for home. She bought the flower, a hibiscus, to, in a sense, bring her back home. When the spring comes, she will bud with the flower and take the test again. This is her new home with new hibiscus. After all, winter is no time for a flower, but it is a time to prepare for blooming.
509	9372	4	3	Saeng did get the feel that she called failing in and buying something that could help her but also have her missing where she's from. And with her mother getting a little mad about it because of the programs she paid for, she vowed silently to herself in the spring that she'd take the test again, determined to improve her score and prove her dedication.
510	9373	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng has confidence to take the driving test. After practicing diligently and overcoming her initial nervousness, she feels ready to demonstrate her skills, marking a significant step toward independence and solidifying her resolve to pass the test.
511	9374	4	3	The author leaves the story there because it keeps you guessing on what is going to happen next. That is really all you need to know about the story to understand its core message. The important parts the author has told already concern Saeng's character and her mother's sacrifices & the future is a whole different story. It doesn't matter if Saeng passes the test or what happens over the winter following the events of the story. The author has told us everything we need to know about the importance of this person & her mother's unwavering dedication to her daughter's well-being.
512	9375	4	3	Saeng feels out of place in her new home and new country. She vows silently that in a year she will take the test again. She vows that in a year she will be used to her new home and new country and will start to enjoy life again. The author concluded with this paragraph because Saeng will hopefully adjust and enjoy her new home, believing that in a year she will be more accustomed to what happens in her new country. Saeng just feels out of place and wants to wait a while until she feels ready to retake the test, giving herself time to adapt. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she made a vow to herself, a promise to strive for a better future, and hopefully she will keep the vow and make it happen.
513	9376	4	3	The author might of concluded the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng isnt **going** to stop trying; she's **going** to work harder. As she sees the Geese adapting, she chooses to try and make their new home work out. After they disappear, she picks herself up and says that she's **going** to try again. By doing this, she is committing herself to try **new** things to adapt to changes, ultimately demonstrating her resilience.
514	9377	4	3	I think she ends the story with this paragraph because she wants to take the test in the @DATE1 time when it won't be so hard on her. It will be warm again, and it's not quite as cold, suggesting she anticipates better conditions and perhaps a clearer mind to perform well.
515	9378	4	3	The story concludes with that paragraph for a number of reasons. First, in the spring it is warm and sunny and this helped to end the story in a happy note, offering a sense of optimism after Saeng's initial struggles. Next this shows that Saeng can adapt to her new home, just as the hibiscus she carefully tended will survive through the harsh winter and bloom again, symbolizing her resilience. Finally, it shows Saeng is determined and won't let her mother down, continuing to nurture the plant and, by extension, her mother's memory and hopes for her future. That is why the story concludes with that paragraph.
516	9379	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show if they can adapt then she can too. ìIn the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. ìI choose this saying because it shows you if they are able to come back after everything that has happen she can to. She should be able to adapt to a new place just like they do, suggesting a renewed sense of hope. The cyclical return of nature serves as an inspiration, reinforcing her belief in her own resilience.
517	9380	4	3	"Authors often end stories with paragraphs that make readers wonder what happens next. In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, there is an ending paragraph just like that. The author ends it like this because she is looking towards the future and adapting to her new environment. She says that she will take the test when the snow melts, the geese come back, and the hibiscus is blooming, viewing it as a new beginning. She wants to start over and embrace the changes around her. Also, the geese, blooming hibiscus, and melted snow give her hope that she will pass her test and thrive in her new home. She believes now they have a hibiscus, maybe it will be more like where she used to live, fostering a sense of belonging. Authors use endings that make people wonder so people think and continue to ponder the character's journey and future possibilities."
518	9381	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wanted the reader to understand what was going on. For example, they were saying when Saeng vowed silently to herself, ""@CAPS1 when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again,"" this helped the reader understand Saeng's determination and where her head was at, allowing for a clearer understanding of the author's message and her character's resolve."
519	9382	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the geese and the hibiscus were both things that were familiar to Saeng. They remind her of her homeland. When the familiar things return, she will have the strength to test again and hopefully do better. The narrator says, “Overhead a V of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng now.” This shows how the geese are a symbol of the familiar things from her homeland that help Saeng feel more comfortable in her new home and suggest a renewed sense of belonging that will bolster her confidence.
520	9383	4	3	"The author included that paragraph because the hibiscus plant makes her think of where she is from and helps her to succeed at certain things. She notes that this particular hibiscus isn't quite the same, saying, ""I mean, not like the kind we had at—"" she found that she was still too shaky to say the words ""at home."" She misses being home, and this plant helps her bring back memories of being there. Therefore, the author included that paragraph to show the reader that she misses her homeland and finds a connection to it through the familiar plant."
521	9384	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it might be important to the author about Saeng. It's something personal about her past or where she had come from. She's trying to say that when she comes back in the spring she's going to take the test again in school, OR she is going to plant something over again in the spring. As it's snow and it's too cold to plant anything, that where she came from is really important to her and she misses it and wants to go back to where she came from. This emphasis on returning and replanting suggests a deep connection to her origins and a hope for future success tied to those roots.
522	9385	4	3	"The author concludes this story with ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, whe the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take the test again"". She does this because in the story this plant has given her a lot of belief in herself to be do better in the future. The hibiscus, struggling yet resilient, mirrored her own situation and instilled in her a newfound determination that with perseverance, like the hibiscus blooming again, she too could succeed."
523	9386	4	3	The author concludes the story this way for a few reasons. One reason is that she will have more experience with her new country. She only left her homeland a few months before, so in about six more months she will be more knowledgeable about the ways of the new country. This will make her more capable of passing the @CAPS1 Ed test, as she'll better understand the cultural context and expectations. Also, in the spring is when the flower will be beautiful again, and this will give her new-found strength that will cause her to pass, symbolizing her own growth and resilience mirroring nature's rebirth. The few months' time will allow the author time to mentally and physically prepare for the exam. Mentally, she will be able to study and learn all she needs to know. And physically, she will have adjusted better to her new environment, allowing her to approach the exam with renewed confidence and vigor.
524	9387	4	3	In order to get over her failure, Saeng bought a flower that reminded her of home. Saeng started to cry when she bought the flower. She wanted to be back home. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show how she will take the test when she feels like she is at home. “When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” Saeng said to herself. Those things make her feel welcome and feeling that way will help her with her test. The paragraph concludes the story with all the things she is comfortable with, revealing the essence of 'home' for Saeng. This conclusion helps the reader understand what reminds her of home and also explains how much the hibiscus flower meant to her. Buying the flower helps her with her troubles, acting as a tangible link to her past. Seeing the geese fly reminds her of her home and the familiar rhythms of life there. The author concludes the story with the memories that will help Saeng in the future, providing a sense of hope and resilience.
525	9388	4	3	I think the author ended this story with this conclusion because everyone should have fresh starts, or second chances. I guess the author was leaving in a message stating if you fail once you should at least try again. When Saeng failed the test, it seems as though her self-esteem lowered, and her mother tried cheering her up, reminding her of her strengths and encouraging her to persevere. Eventually, she realized it would be bad giving up and not trying again with a fresh start, understanding that failure is a part of learning and growth and that a new attempt offers the opportunity to apply what she learned from the previous experience. Therefore, the ending emphasizes the importance of resilience and the possibility of redemption through renewed effort.
526	9389	4	3	"Minfong Ho included the last paragraph in the story because it alluded to the fact that Saeng felt better and more confident when reminded of home. When Saeng saw the hibiscus she got a feeling ""so intense, it was almost visceral.” The flower was creatively used by Ho, symbolizing resilience. She said that the winter hibiscus is strong enough to make it through the cold months, which made the reader think after reading the last paragraph, that this flower must give Saeng hope and confidence. Also, the geese make a V which I infer would mean Vietnam to Saeng, which is what the author is trying to get her reader to think. That is why “and the geese return” is mentioned in the last paragraph, suggesting a cyclical return to roots and strength. Minfong Ho wants her readers to realize that objects that make us more comfortable and happy are what make us strong and confident in the end. The author did a great job placing that last thought into the last paragraph because it perfectly sums up the lesson, and that is that you should do things when you feel confident and it feels like home to you. You may be small and fragile, but if you “plant” yourself you can thrive with confidence, drawing strength from familiar comforts and the memories of home."
527	9390	4	3	The last paragraph at the end of the story was the author's way of showing how Saeng wanted spring to come early because she longs to see her hibiscus bloom. If spring doesn't come fast, she will not get to see her hibiscus, a symbol of hope, and the snow won't melt, keeping her isolated. When Saeng finally emerges, she hopes she can take the test and continue her education, representing her aspirations for the future.
528	9391	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because that winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her. For example, back in her home town she had hibiscus's and everything was fine and normal; she lived her life and so on. Well then, she moved to the U.S., and she didn’t have any hibiscus, she just failed her driving test, she feels misplaced, and doesn't fit in. So, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost. The hibiscus offers a connection to her past. She felt a sense of security. In conclusion, the author ended with that sentence because it's a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start, offering hope and a renewed sense of purpose in her new environment."
529	9392	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it resembles her own life, that she will have another chance, just as geese will come back again. The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards the new year and Flowers come back. The hibiscus plant will bloom again and that will renew, In a way, her warming thought of her old home. Then that will be the time to retake her driving test that she failed, which was before she bought the plant. The author added this last part because it tied and matched so well with the story, creating a hopeful outlook for the future.
530	9393	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with one small paragraph is because sometimes the little things count the most, and the author thought that in two sentences he could summarize the most important things in the story, highlighting a final, poignant thought. I think that the author did a great job in ending the story concisely.
531	9394	4	3	The author concludes with with paragraph because Saeng has to take the test all over. She might think there's a better chance when it blooms and the snow melts. So that is when Saeng is going to try and take the test after the snow melts and the hibiscus blooms, indicating a time of renewal and perhaps a more favorable atmosphere for success.
532	9395	4	3	The author concludes with this sentence for a couple reasons. Saeng feels that she can’t do it until the spring because that is when the geese come back, a symbol of hope and return. Also that is when the hibiscus buds, representing new beginnings and potential. In a way she feels as though she will blossom in spring, mirroring the hibiscus, and be able to pass the test, both academic and personal.
533	9396	4	3	I think that the author includes this paragraph in this story because the grandmother might think that it is a test to see what she can get done at that time. The grandmother might get more done than she should, perhaps pushing herself too hard to prove something. This could stem from a desire to be seen as capable or useful, leading her to overexert herself. Ultimately, this paragraph likely serves to highlight the grandmother's motivations and potential for overdoing things.
534	9397	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story like that because @MONTH1, maybe she’s saying that by that time she’ll be ready to take the test again. Another way of thinking is that @MONTH1, by that time when that happens in spring, she would be prepared and more confident of herself. @MONTH1, maybe the author was trying to say that just like the beginning of a new spring, it would be a new beginning for her, a chance to approach the challenge with renewed hope and a stronger sense of self-belief.
535	9398	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again. For example, despite failing her driving test, a setback that initially discouraged her, she decides to take it over after having the experience of planting with her mother. It seems as if planting the hibiscus, and nurturing it, has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again. In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting; she was learning the rhythm and finding satisfaction in the process. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that, even if it's just planting a flower, she knows that she can take the test again and accomplish that. In conclusion, that is why I think the author concluded with that paragraph, emphasizing Saeng's newfound resilience and willingness to persevere.
536	9399	4	3	The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus, recently transplanted, is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings, drawing strength from unfamiliar soil and weather. Saeng had just failed her driving test so she's bummed about that, feeling defeated by a simple task. The concluding sentence makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges and blossom, just as the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings and thrive.
537	9400	4	3	The author includes this as the last paragraph because it could give Saeng's mother hope. It could give hope because they could really need Saeng to pass the test, perhaps due to the significant opportunities or better future it promises for him and, by extension, for her as well, making his success deeply intertwined with their shared well-being and future prospects.
538	9401	4	3	It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reestablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. It showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down because she could not remember her homeland. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next even though the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph it says, “This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging, unresolved and incomplete. The meaning of the story is much clearer with it as a reader.
539	9402	4	3	Including the bit about taking the test again when the hibiscus is budding provides a sense of closure and lesson to an otherwise open ending. Saeng fails the drivers test early in the story; then on her way home, she buys a hibiscus. The reader really doesn’t see a connection until this last paragraph. The hibiscus represents perseverance and strength, mirroring Saeng's own journey. After a harsh winter, this hibiscus can bloom again and continue to live. Even after moving from Vietnam and struggling to adapt, Saeng must recover and keep trying, just like the flower, illustrating her resilience. Just like the flower blooming again, so will Saeng. She will take the test a second time and pass. She will adapt to her environment and keep going, just like the hibiscus, demonstrating her ability to overcome challenges.
540	9403	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back , Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding , then I will take the test again ,” because the author started out the story after Saeng failed her driving test. Saeng is reminded of her homeland from the Hibiscus. After Saeng wanted the Hibiscus in the garden, “a flock it canada geese flow by,” as they flew by Saeng felt a sign at comfort and vowed to herself what started everything. Thus, if Saeng did pass the driving test then she would of never found the Hibiscus, making her renewed determination intrinsically linked to her initial failure and the subsequent discovery of the flower and the geese, symbols of home and hope.
541	9404	4	3	The author include it because her mother took the test and passed it, and the daughter wanted to do the same, just like her mom. And she can only take it in the spring because there are no flowers out in the winter, and the test required identifying specific blooms to pass. This desire to emulate her mother created a special significance around the spring test, representing a shared experience and a connection to her family history, making the successful completion of the test even more meaningful.
542	9405	4	3	I think the author is trying to show that Saeng is finally starting to accept and get over the struggles in her life. It is showing that she has finally gotten used to @LOCATION1 and the customs, but she still hasn’t forgotten her heritage, as the food preference indicates; “But she had herself much preferred it to a Big Mac.” It also proves that she is going to be positive and not let discouragement overcome her, deciding she’s going to retake it and try again. This is a stark contrast to her initial look on her situations in life. But after visiting the floral shop, she discovers a more cheery, optimistic outlook on her situation and decides to do something about it, showing her resilience.
543	9406	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. One reason I think is because she’s concluding that the winter is there, and when winter is over, she is going to start flowering and planting again. In the story it said, “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now,…” which suggests a period of dormancy and anticipation. So, now she has to wait for winter to pass by; then the hibiscus will be starting to grow and will hopefully bloom by spring. The ending highlights a cyclical nature, with the promise of renewal and growth, which is why I think she concluded the story the way she did.
544	9407	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the question of what about her test? Needed to be answered and thatís when she'd be comfortable to take it. In the text, to her, the plant felt smooth and cool just as she had known it, which was comforting. She closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. Unlike her grandmother, she felt a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung her eyes, with sadness, and maybe disappointment, which she probably wouldn't want to deal with for a while, hinted at in the conclusion. Her mother even uttered a small cry of surprise and delight to see the flower, even before being shocked when Saeng reveals she paid all of over nineteen dollars for it. With this concluding paragraph, I believe that she will be more comfortable at the time planned because she'll have new and old things to come home to, such as the geese and plant, offering her a sense of continuity and grounding amidst the changes in her life.
545	9408	4	3	In the story ìWinter Hibiscusî the author includes this ending paragraph because she wants to show that next time around she will be prepared and ready for the garden and the challenges it holds, particularly the nuances of a new environment. This first time, she wasnít ready, and she didnít know about the winter hibiscus because she never did anything like it before, highlighting a journey of adaptation and learning that suggests future gardening attempts will be approached with more knowledge and anticipation. This newfound awareness promises a more informed and successful experience.
546	9409	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the story ends with saying “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author ends the story like that because it is showing that even though she failed the test once, she’s not going to give up just because of an adjustment change. The Hibiscus made the reader realize that a plant in the foreign place where she lives can adapt, so can she, suggesting resilience and hope for future success.
547	9410	4	3	The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming, she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma with her hair before she moved, which was a comforting routine. So if the flower is blooming, then it would remind her of her grandma, creating a sense of familiarity and comfort, which would be incentive to do good on the test and feel more settled in her new environment.
548	9411	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a personification involving snow smelting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. It's explaining moments in time, marking a subtle shift. The author describes how isolated the hibiscus is, a single point of vibrant color against the backdrop of a thawing world, emphasizing its unique resilience.
549	9412	4	3	The author ended the story with that paragraph because it’s telling how Saeng feels about winter being near and how she has to wait until spring comes back around to do her tests again. A sense of resignation settles over her as the cold air hints at the dormant months ahead, knowing her experiments must be paused, patiently awaiting the thaw and the return of the vital warmth needed to continue her work. This paints a picture of anticipation mixed with acceptance, concluding her current endeavors and highlighting the cyclical nature of her research, tied as it is to the seasons.
550	9413	4	3	Saeng cares about the flowers. She cares about the flower's delicate petals and vibrant colors. Natural occurrence with them growing unique. She appreciates the imperfections and variations that make each blossom special, recognizing the beauty in their individuality and the natural processes that shape them, showing her deep affection for the floral world.
551	9414	4	3	I don’t know why the author wrote the story; with that I really don’t know. Maybe she was talking about how she took all the tests and now she wouldn’t take them over again, ever. The time has come. She is in school, and when one took the test, it was a kind of trial, one that is now over. It is @DATE1, and school is over, so the pressure is finally off.
552	9415	4	3	The author concludes the paragraph into the story because an ending was needed to provide closure. Furthermore, the author selected a conclusion that would best fit the narrative, ensuring a satisfying resolution for the reader. Thus, the paragraph serves as a deliberate and fitting culmination of the story's events.
553	9416	4	3	I believe that the author chose to conclude the story the way they did because the story was about perseverance. For example, the story was based around the winter hibiscus plant, which bloomed even in the cold. This is a good example because in the end Saeng vows that she will persevere and take her test again, and the hibiscus perseveres and forges through the winter, not allowing itself to die. Another example is that Saeng's mother worked outside while it was cold to get her gardening done. This relates to the story because she stayed out in the cold garden to get her job done; she could have quit and gone inside the nice warm house, just like Saeng could have quit and said she was not going to try to take her test again. But she did not; she said she was going to try again, which demonstrates how the author chose to end the story to truly encompass the theme of perseverance.
554	9417	4	3	"I think the author ended this story like that because it means that she hasn't given up yet, and even though she failed the first time, she is going to try again. ""In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" means that when all is renewed, she will try to do it again because if she passes, it will be worthwhile. The story was pretty bad because I don't even know what she failed, so I didn't like it."
555	9418	4	3	"I think the reason why the author ended the story with this ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again"" paragraph because like this the plant didn’t have a fair chance for survival in the winter and was the same with the girl when she took her driving test, unprepared and in unfavorable conditions; but in spring the plant has a chance to bloom, symbolizing renewed hope, so she believes she has a chance to pass the test because there is a time and place for everything, and spring represents the right time for her to try again, suggesting that with preparation and favorable circumstances, she will succeed."
556	9419	4	3	"Emotion, commitment, hope, all are reasons why the author ended the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" That last paragraph shows that she has emotion, specifically resilience in the face of potential disappointment. Next, it shows that she has commitment, as she states that when the hibiscus blooms again, she will retake the test, demonstrating dedication to her goal. Lastly, it shows that there is hope, implying that she believes in her ability to improve and succeed in the future. Therefore, these emotional elements effectively explain the author's choice to conclude the story with that particular paragraph."
557	9420	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize her new found determination to overcome her obstacles. For example, in the passage she states, ìshe realized that many of the things she had thought strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiarizes to her.î At this point she has an epiphany, and realizes that life is like seasons. In the end paragraph she intercedes this by saying that in the spring she will take the test again. This shows that just as the winter hibiscus is along winter, and then blooms in the spring, she must be strong during these hard times. One day her time will come for her to ìbloom.î @CAPS1 experiences hard times, but we all must be strong and steadfast as we wait for our time to ìbloom,î and this cyclical imagery offers hope and resilience in the face of adversity.
558	9421	4	3	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because he wanted to show that she wasn't going to give up just because she failed one time. She failed the test one time already, which was disheartening. She was very sad about it. She went and bought a plant to try again. Saeng's mom told her that they were going to do it the right way this time around. Saeng was crying when she told her mom about it, overwhelmed by the setback. Her mom was very understanding, though, offering comfort and support. Her mom could have been very mad with her, especially given the importance of the test. She could have used a plant that they grew, saving money and effort. The plant @MONTH1 might not grow right now due to the season. She should have bought a real plant from someone else to ensure success. Therefore, the ending emphasizes Saeng's resilience and her mother's unwavering support, highlighting their determination to succeed despite the initial failure.
559	9422	4	3	"Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have on their long journey and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like she's starting over so that she’s able to pass this test that seems important to her. When the author writes, ""and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,"" it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort, illustrating her fresh perspective and renewed motivation. Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism for Saeng's future endeavors."
560	9423	4	3	The author of ì Winter Hibiscusî by Minfong Ho ends the story with the statement, ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take test again,î because it showed that Saeng had overcome her problem and vowed to correct it. By ending with this statement the author showed that the beauty of nature can help one to overcome their problems, as did Saeng. Upon seeing the Geese migrate and the ìWinter Hibiscusî Saeng, ìrealized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese.î Saeng realized that the test although strange and different to her now became familiar because of her experiences with nature. Seeing the geese and ìWinter Hibiscusî remind her that even the unfamiliar can become familiar with time and perseverance. This plant also made Saeng think of her past in Vietnam and all of one good times back at her home. ìThe familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost fast the light strures of her grandmothers long gray hair, freshly mashed.î The plant made her think of good experiences. In the end, the plant made her joyous enough not to think about the past, but about the future, about taking the test again and her new life in the United States.
561	9424	4	3	The reason why the author puts that last line into the story of the end is to show us the raids and saeng that even though it's almost over, she doesn’t want it to end. But she knows that it will also start up again next year when things go back to the way they were before everything changed. This cyclical nature, the temporary respite before the inevitable return to the raids and the saeng, emphasizes the enduring impact of these events. This is why I think the author put that line into the story, highlighting the bittersweet reality of endings and beginnings.
562	9425	4	3	The author concluded the story with Saeng vowing to herself “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to express her determination of fitting into new things and to express the change she was getting used to. Describing spring was important in the conclusion because it described what Saeng once thought was odd in @LOCATION1, but got used to the seasons and weather changing. The hibiscus, budding in spring, symbolizes a fresh start and her own growth. Once she realized that she needed to deal with change, she knew that she would need to try the driving test again. It was very important that the author’s conclusion was “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because it expressed how Saeng was accepting change in her life, demonstrating her resilience and newfound adaptability.
563	9426	4	3	In ìwinter Hibiscusî the author uses hibiscus flower to symbolize beauty in unexpected places, adapting to a new life, and Saeng's home country. At the end of the story I think that the author realizes that even though she failed the test, everything is going to be okay. While looking at the hibiscus she remembers her old life, which she loved, and she is reminded of the natural beauty that can be found in a hibiscus flower, even in winter. In life, I think every one should always remember that even though one might be disappointed at sometime, we have to keep in mind, the fact that life goes on. There will always be another chance, as long as you can find peace and beauty in something good, like Saeng finds in the hibiscus, reminding us that resilience and hope can bloom even in challenging circumstances.
564	9427	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar, highlighting their shared potential for growth. The plant represents Saeng’s strength and abilities, currently dormant but full of promise. She knows that only when she is stronger, revitalized in the spring like the plant, will she be ready to retake the test with renewed confidence. Her hopes, currently fragile, will be stronger and more resilient like the plant flourishing in the spring. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph, emphasizing Saeng's anticipated resurgence.
565	9428	4	3	"I believe the author ends the story with this paragraph because it refers to previous events in the story. For example it says, ""and this hibiscus is budding."" This refers back to the beginning of the story when Saeng first saw the hibiscus plant and it reminded her of home, creating a sense of nostalgia and connection. This is a good way to conclude a story, bringing it full circle. I wouldn’t change it at all if I could. Also in the summary before the story it says how she had failed her driver’s test and in the last paragraph it says, ""then I will take that test again."" I think Saeng didn’t have much confidence before taking the test because of her new surroundings, but now that she is familiar with everything and found a hobby, she will likely think of passing while taking the test again, suggesting a newfound hope. I think she is looking to start over and forget about failing, indicating a resolution to her initial struggles."
566	9429	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she overcame adversity and she wants to retake the quiz for herself and to prove it to herself, not for anyone else's validation. She states, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" emphasizing her personal resolve. So, because she says that she wants to retake the test, it's clear she is not being pressured into taking it. She is taking it to prove something to herself, demonstrating her resilience and determination to conquer the challenge she previously faced."
567	9430	4	3	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, a young girl named Saeng recalls her life before she moved to America. She misses her homeland and all of the things she loved before she came here. Towards the end of the story, the author includes a paragraph saying that Saeng vowed to take her driver's test again when winter ends, when the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with this paragraph for one reason: He/She wants to show that Saeng is strong enough to survive the winter, just like the hibiscus, and will be ready when the weary days of winter are over, and the beautiful days of spring come. Saeng’s mother states, “It’s strong enough to make it through the cold months…That’s what matters”. The winter hibiscus is a direct parallel to Saeng in that just like it, she is strong enough to survive the winter months, and ultimately, she too, will blossom again.
568	9431	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to make the reader want more. When an author ends the chapter of a story or an episode of a show it is always a good idea to use a cliffhanger to drag the audience along. In many stories I have read this is used. In my favorite series, the CAPSTONE Chronicles, the Peterson book always ends with a cliff-hanger. Like in the end of the third book one of the soldiers is killed but you don’t find out by who until the next book, effectively hooking the reader and ensuring they return for the continuation of the narrative.
569	9432	4	3	The author concludes this story the way she does to say that the girl is not going to give up on trying to fit in this new country. The author concludes this way because it refers that it's not over, and even though the test was a failure, it won't be next time. The author lets us know that the little girl cares about the test and wants to prove to people that she can pass it. She is reminded of her home by these flowers, and with this reminder she can retake it and do it right, showing her resilience and determination to succeed in her new environment.
570	9434	4	3	I think the author included that in the paragraph because Saeng didn't like the cold, so she would wait until the snow melts and the geese return to test the plants again, preferring the warmer weather for her work. I also think she added it to show that she would come back to visit her mother, ensuring their connection remained strong despite her travels.
571	9435	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test and in the spring she will take the test over, armed with a renewed determination to succeed after understanding her weaknesses.
572	9436	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides closure to both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you’ve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adapt to the way we drive here, along with all our rule and laws, indicating her willingness to learn and persevere despite the setback. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and Saeng’s resilience.
573	9437	4	3	Saeng was taking a test, and she didn’t quite pass it. She was afraid to tell her mother, but she had to tell her anyway. Her mother got upset because she didn’t pass it, expressing her disappointment. Saeng knows that right after winter's over, she’ll be taking that same test again, and she hoped she would pass it this time so she could make her mother proud.
574	9438	4	3	In the story, ìWinter Hibiscusî by Minfong Ho, the author includes the phrase, -When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again- because she wanted to make the story end with Saeng finding positive views on her new home and positive views in the future and have her look forward to it. Throughout the short story, Saeng happens to have a sad disposition about her new home and how the plants remind her recent home. - ìI mean its not the kind we at-at-ì she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burst into tears again.- This phrase shows that Saeng really missed her home and was truly sad about it. Seeing the hibiscus bloom in winter, a time of hardship and cold, likely inspires her. The concluding phrase shown before shows that she found the strength to look positively at the future of her new home, suggesting a newfound resilience and hope for her life in America.
575	9439	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the beginning of the story Saeng went to take a driving test but didn’t pass, and so she goes and buys a hibiscus that reminds her of home and gives her strength and comfort. So her mother says this at the end because she knows Saeng is going through a hard time adapting to her new country, with the driving test being a symbol of her struggle, and she doesn’t want to put more pressure on her just because she knows Saeng is very upset and is trying to make it up to her by buying a flower for her. So she says by next spring she should be adapted and ready for the test because the flower should give her hope. She wants her to know she is there for her, offering unspoken support and understanding as Saeng navigates her new life.
576	9440	4	3	I think the author of ìWinter Hibiscusî said ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test again.î to conclude the story for many reasons. First, it shows that she isn’t giving up despite facing a challenge in a new country and struggling with the language, demonstrating her resilience. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope for what's to come, suggesting a brighter future where she overcomes obstacles. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time, creating suspense and keeping the reader engaged. That is probably why the author ended it that way, leaving a lasting impression of perseverance and anticipation.
577	9441	4	3	The author of the Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with the paragraph to show the connection between the hibiscus and @CAPS1, a young immigrant adjusting to a new country. The hibiscus has to survive the winter until spring when it can bloom and become big and beautiful. @CAPS1 is connecting to the flower and saying she can make it through her obstacles that come with the change in environment if the flower can deal with being confined in a plastic container and surviving the weather. She feels that right now she's like the Hibiscus, uprooted and waiting. She’s trapped because the area is alien to her and she has to adjust. Just as the container is alien to the flower because it’s used to being free in nature. But once it’s planted, it will become a part of its surroundings and grow. And once she accepts the change and becomes willing to start over, she will begin to grow, gaining confidence and perhaps finding everyday tasks, like her driving test, easier. In conclusion, this is the reason the author concluded the paragraph with this sentence, to highlight the parallel journey of resilience and adaptation between the flower and the protagonist.
578	9442	4	3	In the short story ìWinter Hibiscusî, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test ìwhen the snow melts and the geese return.î I believe that the Hibiscus and the driverís test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The authorís intention of the last line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of failing the test. She is upset that she failed her driverís test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and start to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again, illustrating her resilience. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage, symbolizing hope and growth. It will blossom like Saeng, reflecting her journey of perseverance and eventual success.
579	9443	4	3	The author probably includes part of the story with the paragraph to put more details into the paragraph, trying to talk about the life that Saeng had vowed silently to herself in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again, illustrating that with the return of nature's beauty and the promise of new beginnings, specifically when flowers start blooming again and spring comes around again, that's when she will take that test and pass this time, showcasing her renewed determination and aligning her personal goals with the cyclical renewal of the natural world.
580	9444	4	3	"I think the author concludes the story with this because she's proving she has the strength to do something that she failed the first time again. She took this plant and looked at it as a memory and a passage of time. Saeng planted it as a reminder of home and her promise. Saeng said, ""It's not a real one,"" ""Not like the kind we had before."" Saeng loved home and wished she was back there, but her new promise was what had mattered, and now she could nurture this new plant and fulfill that promise."
581	9445	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it signals a new beginning, a fresh start with the arrival of day time. This symbolizes the opportunity she has to take the test on a budding new day. The return of the geese indicates spring, mirroring the hibiscus bud, suggesting her test is also timed with this season of renewal, and concluding the story with this imagery emphasizes the hope and potential inherent in this fresh start.
582	9446	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to take the driving test in springtime. Springtime is a symbol of positive feelings; she gets positive feelings from the blooming of the winter hibiscus, a resilient flower that blooms even when things are difficult, reminding her of her own perseverance. Thus, the hibiscus blooming in spring inspires her confidence for the test.
583	9447	4	3	They had to come back, so they did, and they were walking into a then world over there in the corner, a world of faded photographs and whispered memories, and the childhood world too, complete with the familiar scent of pine and damp earth, just as she had known it would feel. The worn porch swing creaked a welcome, solidifying the comfort she sought.
584	9448	4	3	This last paragraph is written for several reasons. First, she will try again when she feels the time is right. Just like the geese coming back, Saeng will come back to take the test, and so the Hibiscus plant will also bloom again. She feels that it is the right thing to do and it will be the right time to come back and take the test. This paragraph describes Saeng well, capturing her patience and resilience; it reflects how she lives and how she will approach the test again, trusting her own internal sense of readiness. Ultimately, she believes in returning when the moment aligns with her own preparedness and conviction.
585	9449	4	3	"I believe that the author ends because the author is showing that Saeng is determined to pass the test. ""She paused as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes."" (Ho) This quote shows that passing the test meant a lot to Saeng. She was crying because she couldn't help but buy the plant and fail the test. She didn't want to fail and showed her sadness by crying. This highlights how deeply she cared about the outcome and the principles behind it. ""Then I will take the test again."" (Ho) This quote shows that even though she failed, she is determined to pass the test and succeed. Failing hurt her greatly, so she can't wait to do it again and pass because she is determined to succeed. This willingness to immediately try again underscores her resolve. This is all important because Saeng shows that determination is the key to success and she is determined, making her willingness to try again a testament to her character and the importance of perseverance."
586	9450	4	3	"The author uses this paragraph to conclude the story to show Saeng's determination and her adaptation to her new home. This shows her determination because it says, ""I will take that test again,"" revealing her resolve to not give up despite facing challenges. This also shows that she has adapted to her new home, as she is now willing to persevere and integrate herself into the system, indicating a growing sense of belonging and a proactive approach to her future."
587	9451	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she was upset that she moved away from her friends and familiar surroundings. She is also upset that she failed her drivers test, hindering her independence in this new place. So she planted the plant, a tangible act of hope for the future, and says that when spring comes, symbolizing renewal and new beginnings, she will retry her drivers test, demonstrating her resolve to adapt and overcome her setbacks.
588	9452	4	3	"In the story, ìWinter Hibiscus"", by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with a paragraph with Saeng vowing she will take the test again in the spring. Minfong used this paragraph because it means never give up, even if you fail the first time. For example, Saeng just failed her driver's test, feeling dejected after misinterpreting the yield sign, but after buying the Hibiscus and delving deeper into things, recognizing its resilience to bloom even in winter, she realized she shouldn't give up. This newfound determination, fueled by the hibiscus's symbolic persistence, underscores the story's message about perseverance."
589	9453	4	3	The author concludes with this sentence for emphasis. It takes Saengís mind off of the flower and she focuses on her test. By waiting until next spring to take the test it gives her something to look forward to, a renewed goal. This statement also shows that you should never give up on anything that you do, even when faced with setbacks. The author ends on a good note explaining this, offering a message of hope and perseverance. The last paragraph is also a break from the rest of the story and from what Saengës was just doing, shifting the focus to her future aspirations. It is Saengís last and final thoughts, providing closure and a sense of optimism.
590	9454	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, I think, to say that when the hibiscus starts to grow back, she will be back at what she started. I think that is why, because she says, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.” This suggests a cyclical return, mirroring nature's renewal, implying she'll revisit her challenge with renewed hope and a fresh perspective, signifying a return to her initial state of striving.
591	9455	4	3	The author concludes the story with a paragraph so the people reading the story would actually read it and not guess how the story is going to go. This final passage serves as a safeguard against premature assumptions, compelling readers to follow the narrative's intended path and experience its unfolding events directly, rather than jumping to conclusions based on limited information. The intention is to maintain suspense and encourage a deeper engagement with the text, ensuring the story's impact is felt fully and completely.
592	9456	4	3	The authors conclusion in the story explains that after all that team work and handwork you should keep that flow going each year. Even though something might have changed, like team members or project specifics, the collaborative spirit and dedication to quality should remain constant. This ensures continued success and improvement year after year, fostering a culture of sustained excellence.
593	9457	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. Saeng had a bad day, from failing the test to her deep feeling of loss, but after finding the hibiscus and planting it she seemed to be enlightened, while she still missed her homeland but had comforting memories. She shows determination, because she declares she will take that test again, and seems to have more confidence in herself. The author adds that Saeng will take the test again in the spring. When looking at archetypes, spring is a time of new beginnings and life, mirroring Saeng's renewed resolve. When the hibiscus is budding (being reborn), she will take the test, symbolizing a fresh start. It will be a new, better start for Saeng too, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism for her future.
594	9458	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show determination. It shows that Saeng wants to take her time to adjust to her new life and her new surroundings, observing the nuances of her environment. Then she thinks it might feel more like this place is becoming a home, a comfortable and familiar space. She feels that maybe, if she's been used to this new place for awhile, absorbing its rhythms and atmosphere, she will have a better chance at passing the test. She is determined to pass the test, showing her resilience and commitment to succeeding in this new chapter.
595	9459	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when Saeng was saying this to herself, she made a promise to not give up getting her license, and the hibiscus makes her feel like she is at home again. The hibiscus reminds her of warmth and familiarity. In the text when the mother says, ""@CAPS1 seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. Thats what matters,"" when she says this, it makes Saeng not so sad because she knows that the hibiscus will remind her of the hibiscus at home and that gives her the power to want to try again in the spring, renewing her determination to succeed despite the setbacks."
596	9460	4	3	The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think that the author includes this paragraph to show how persistent Saeng is. Saeng is persistent because she tries over and over again at this “test,” showing resilience in the face of a challenge, and also she tries to get used to her new country. It demonstrates this in the story when it says the quote above. This quote shows that Saeng can try something and fail, then be determined to try and succeed again, revealing her strong will. Also in the story, Saeng has moved from one country to another. This is a huge jump, a significant life change, and for her to be confident with herself is very persistent. The way the author concludes the story, with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” definitely portrays Saeng, the main character, as a persistent person, and that is the purpose of the quote, solidifying her character as someone who doesn't give up easily.
597	9461	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants the audience to think about what he said and to want to read more. For example, I was reading a book that ended in a question, and I wanted to read more to discover the answer to the question. Another example is that I was reading another book that ended in a statement, and I wanted to read another book by the same author, but they didn't have one, so I don't know how the story ultimately ended. That's why authors end stories like that, so they can make you read another book with the resolution, or at least ponder the possibilities beyond the page.
598	9462	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. The author wanted to convey a sense of hope to show the growth of her character, and to show how things are going to change. In the last paragraph when she vows that she will take that test again it gives you a sense that everything will be okay. Earlier in the story she had been crying and missing her homeland; the tone was troubled and sad. This last paragraph suggests that the tone is now hopeful, demonstrating resilience. Even though she failed the test, she is still going to try again, showing her unwavering spirit. The author also put the paragraph to show how much her character has grown. Saying that she will try again shows how much stronger and more determined she is. Lastly, she had the story end with that paragraph to foreshadow what is to come. The geese coming back and the snow melting, and the hibiscus budding all show a change in the seasons, mirroring the cyclical nature of life. This represents the change that has occurred in her and it foreshadows that things will be different from now on, indicating a brighter future.
599	9463	4	3	The author concluded the story with that message is because, if you think about it, if not, that seems to negate the whole story and leaves an opening for a sequel. It's obvious that the whole point of the story is to make you think, prompting reflection long after the final page.
600	9464	4	3	I think the author added this paragraph because it signals a new start for her. Because she has had a hard time, it doesn't mean she will always have hard times, suggesting a shift towards a more positive future and the hope that things will improve. This paragraph, therefore, acts as an optimistic turning point in her narrative.
601	9465	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it meant a lot to Saeng. Saeng failed her driving test and was scared to tell her mother that she also spent nineteen dollars for ""Dok Faeng-noi,"" which was a flower/plant they had back at home. For example, ""As Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test, she sees a familiar plant."" The plant Saeng saw meant a lot to her mother. ""@PERSON1 uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. 'Dok faeng-noi' she said. 'Where did you get it?'"" That was a quote stating that her mother was excited to hear that. The story is concluded by that paragraph because after all Saeng went through, her mother was glad she bought it. ""'It's a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,' she finally said. 'I'm glad you got it.'"" It shows a moment of connection and shared joy between mother and daughter despite the day's setbacks, making it a fitting and heartwarming conclusion."
602	9466	4	3	"Authors sometimes use interesting sentences as their concluding sentence that you often have a hard time understanding. In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes her story by saying ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author says this to show that Saeng is not ready to garden yet and needs to learn more. The mother is very disappointed in the daughter for buying a plant that is very expensive and shows her inexperience in buying things because of your feelings is wrong. This is showed when they say ""I paid over Nineteen dollars for it."" ""You what?"" She also says ""facing. Now where did you get that"" showing her surprise at the expensive, beautiful plant. Authors use those paragraphs and sentences to show or recap the story. The Author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" ends her story with the paragraph because Saeng should not have bought the plant based on having emotions, and that she shall try again next year to not mess up. Therefore, the ending encapsulates Saeng's realization of her impulsive decision and her determination to learn and improve, suggesting a hopeful outlook for the future despite her current setback."
603	9467	4	3	The author of the passage ends the story with this statement to create curiosity. This creates curiosity through writing for the spring and the geese to return. Spring is the beginning for many creatures on the earth; therefore, Saeng is trying to start over because she must wait for the spring. The hibiscus reinforces the feeling of a new beginning in that each year new buds grow, just like she can have a second chance. Saeng waits for the spring because she knows that is when everything else creates new life, so Saeng must wait till then to get her new beginning, implying that her renewal is intrinsically linked to the natural cycle of rebirth and hope that spring embodies.
604	9468	4	3	I think the reason why the author ended the story with that paragraph was because that will be the time she thinks she will be ready to retake the driver’s test. Before she made that move she was disheartened because she failed the test. Maybe she picked the springtime because that gives her time to get herself together and practice between then and the springtime, allowing her to regain confidence and improve her driving skills before facing the challenge again.
605	9469	4	3	"The author includes this sentence, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to show her determination. She is determined to pass the test. Even if she is facing problems adapting to @LOCATION1 she wants to succeed here. So she will wait a year and then try again when she is better prepared. This year-long wait signifies her commitment; she's willing to dedicate herself to acclimating and mastering the required skills, reinforcing her resolve to ultimately pass the test."
606	9470	4	3	The girl had just moved from Vietnam to the United States. It would be hard for her to understand anything, and anything could bring her memory back about Vietnam. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she did fail the test and she wants to see if the hibiscus is budding. “I-I failed the test,” Saeng said to her mother. Her mother actually understood why it happened, the stress of the new environment overwhelming her. She would let Saeng keep the hibiscus because it would make Saeng feel better, a small piece of home in this unfamiliar land. Saeng missed Vietnam a lot and, despite this setback, would like to try her best to overcome obstacles. The hibiscus, a symbol of her homeland, would be a source of strength as she navigated her new life.
607	9471	4	3	The author concludes this paragraph because he wants to make it clearer for the readers, ensuring they fully grasp the intended meaning. This allows the key points to resonate more effectively, making the paragraph stand out within the broader context of the writing and ultimately enhancing comprehension.
608	9472	4	3	"The author finished off the story with that paragraph because it suggests that with time and adaptation, she will be ready for the test. The lines ""and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" imply that all she needs is time to get warm and time to grow. The paragraph is well thought out and relates to the entire story, concluding with a great paragraph that makes a lot of sense in relationship with the story's themes of patience and growth."
609	9473	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by Minfong Ho, Ho concludes the story with that paragraph due to the fact the flower represents Saeng's happiness, reminding her of her home. The flower symbolizes the past and comfort; once Saeng began to dig the ""winter hibiscus,"" ""she could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now."" All of Saeng’s senses were beginning to return; she was happy. Likewise, the author uses the geese to explain the comfort of Saeng, connecting her to something familiar. The country around her began to feel like home. She became familiar with her surroundings. Many references to home were made throughout the piece because home is a place of comfort and happiness. Therefore, Saeng would gain more confidence, which explains the reason Ho concluded with that sentence, solidifying her growing sense of belonging."
610	9474	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, iN the spring, wheN the @CAPS1 melt and the geese RetuRN and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test againî means to the author kinda like the meaning to life. That if you mess up its okay just try again and do better. It suggests a cyclical view where failure isn't final, but an opportunity for future growth. Saeng's vow, tied to the natural cycle of seasons and rebirth, emphasizes the idea of renewal and the chance to improve, highlighting a perspective where life's challenges are met with resilience and determination.
611	9475	4	3	"She concludes that paragraph with the story because she really wants the people to realize that she is, and is always having fun. Also, that she loves where she's at. She's making it in the world, and she loves watching flowers and geese return. The detail that ""this hibiscus is budding"" shows that one of her favorite things to do, something she loves, is observing flowers."
612	9476	4	3	"The author concludes this story this way to go over again the important things in the story. “I will take that test again,” This is the test that she had failed that day, a test that assessed her memory of her home. Her old country was so important to her. The part in the quote, “when they come back.... when they show me it and the geese return,” is referring to when she says, “She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become – almost familiar to her. Like the geese,” She is saying that everything in this country she is starting to get used to, like the geese that fly south every winter. When she uses ""and this hibiscus is budding,"" she is saying how she will remember all the things she has forgotten since moving to this country. When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center – just as she had known it would feel. This whole statement is basically saying that she is starting to forget things about her country as this new country becomes more familiar, but when the geese return each year, she will remember again, and she will take that test of her knowledge and pass, signifying her renewed connection to her past."
613	9477	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he/she is trying to put across the message that the plant shows a symbol of new beginnings, which is a symbol of Saeng’s vow. Also, in the story, caring for the plant teaches Saeng responsibility in obtaining her license; by caring for the plant, it will teach her patience and that she needs to learn from mistakes made, ultimately fostering growth and preparedness.
614	9478	4	3	"The author ends the story with this paragraph because it shows she is not willing to give up on her new life. ""I-I failed the test,"" Saeng had failed her driver's test and was very unhappy. She also disliked her new home. ""She was still too shaky to say at home,"" she missed her old home and she really wanted to give up. After talking to her mother, it renewed her hopes, so the author uses this paragraph to signify that she still has hope in the end and, when she is ready, she will try again, indicating a refusal to surrender to her current difficulties. ""When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again,"" demonstrating her resolve to persevere and adapt to her new environment, revealing her enduring optimism."
615	9479	4	3	The author concludes this in the story to show tone. The paragraph shows how Saeng was determined to try again and pass. This teaches a lesson to the reader, lessons to try your hardest and don’t give up. The last paragraph ends the story with a sense of curiosity, leaving the reader wondering. It makes you want to know more, especially if she passes, effectively concluding the narrative with a lingering question.
616	9480	4	3	I think that the concluding paragraph means after everything else important happens, and what is meant to happen happens, then she will take the test because it's basically the last thing that has to happen in her journey. I think she will pass it because it's meant to happen, completing the intended outcome.
617	9481	4	3	I believe that Saeng made that silent vow to herself because after the plant goes through the hard winter, and once everything goes back to how she likes it and the plant starts budding again, that kind of represents her hard time with moving. So, if this plant that she loves so much can make it through it, then she can too, suggesting a quiet promise to persevere and find her own renewal amidst the challenges of her new environment.
618	9482	4	3	"The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî concludes the story with the excerpt ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test againî because it emphasizes Saeng’s pain to come to an unknown place and fail her first test but also emphasizes Saeng’s resolve to work hard after seeing a flower that resembled one from home. The flower itself is very important to Saeng, for example, the text reads ìAnd besides it was yet another old friend. a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.î This excerpt demonstrates Saeng’s love for her hometown through a flower that she knows grows back home. Another example is when Saeng told her mother the bad news ìI-I failed the testî, her mother, though concerned, showed understanding after Saeng pointed out the familiar flower, drawing her attention to it and allowing her mother to be supportive. In conclusion, the hibiscus flower is Saeng’s source of strength as it’s the only thing she knows in the United States. Saeng wants to show the same resolve on her test that the flower shows in the harsh winter, demonstrating perseverance and hope in a new environment."
619	9483	4	3	The author concludes the story with the afore mentioned paragraph to represent the connection between the return of the hibiscus’ bids, and the return of Saeng’s resolve. In the photograph for question #@NUM1, the hibiscus flower is out of place, as if it doesn’t belong, similar to Saeng's feeling of displacement. The hibiscus represented the link to Saeng’s past, as portrayed when the author writes: “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.” The hibiscus was native to her homeland, and by helping Saeng to remember her past, she began to cope with the present, and later the future, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.” Thus, the cyclical nature of the hibiscus's blooming mirrors Saeng's renewed determination, demonstrating her resilience and hope for the future.
620	9484	4	3	By this quote, the author is explaining that Saeng will eventually be ready for her test. When the geese return, they're ready to return from their migration and when the hibiscus is budding, it is ready to turn into a beautiful flower. Saeng believes that in the spring, since the flower and the geese are ready, she too will be ready for the upcoming examination that looms large in her mind. She draws strength from the natural world, seeing her own potential reflected in the predictable cycles of nature. Her confidence blossoms with the season, suggesting a belief in her ability to master the challenges ahead.
621	9485	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph because the narrator is now willing to accept and adapt to her new environment like the flower would do. Geese like the warm and not the cold, so they are flying south for the winter. Saeng's comfort tone is in @LOCATION1 where she has many childhood memories, including her grandmother and the hibiscus flower. She is used to the flower being in a warm environment. So, when the geese come back in the spring and when the flower blossoms again, she will be ready to adapt to @CAPS1 life more and take her driver's test. The geese and the hibiscus flower are a symbolic memory of her old home in @LOCATION1, which she misses very much, and it is after these things come that she will try to adapt to @CAPS1 ways of life and begin to feel more at home.
622	9486	4	3	Saeng would return to her homeland, eager to see her family again and share the knowledge she had gained abroad. The prospect of familiar sights and sounds filled her with anticipation. She knew reconnecting with her roots would ground her and provide new perspectives, completing her journey of self-discovery.
623	9487	4	3	In the passage “Winter Hibiscus,” the author uses this phrase in the last paragraph: “when they came back, Saeng vows silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” I believe she concluded this story with these words because she is conveying that even when the birds flew away, the seasons, like the birds, would inevitably return. This cyclical return is mirrored in her determination to retake the test. The birds eased into the hibiscus, mingled, because the last paragraph suggests that she would stay and try again next season, which reveals what she values. This is what I understand the last paragraph of the story “Winter Hibiscus” to mean, emphasizing her renewed hope and resolve.
624	9488	4	3	The author concludes this story with the paragraph showing that when it becomes spring and the geese are budding, she said silently to herself that she is going to take the permit again, revealing her persistent determination despite previous setbacks, indicating a cyclical return to her goal with the changing seasons.
625	9489	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show Saeng's determination to survive and be happy in her new home. Although she isn’t happy with her purchase, she is trying to make it seem more homey, adding a touch of familiarity to the unfamiliar. When she says ""I'll take that test again,"" she shows how she wants her surroundings to be comfortable and reflect her own efforts. By ending with this paragraph, it also shows a strength in new beginnings and the cyclical nature of seasons, as if Saeng will start over and try again with her life. She is content for the moment, finding a small measure of peace, but is planning to please herself and her mother again in the spring. This paragraph also serves as a promise to discover a new way to live and make friends in this foreign place. The plant is like a symbol of how she is going to change; she is going to investigate and pass her own test, proving she deserves to be happy and make herself feel at home, signaling a hopeful outlook for her future."
626	9490	4	3	The author concluded this paragraph in the story because it was showing that there are geese that hang around the garden around the spring time, a common sight as the weather warms and they seek out fresh vegetation.
627	9491	4	3	The author in this story explains how hard some changes can be. The author also explains how family and objects from home, such as the flower, can be comforting during these times. The meaning of the story is to show one of the author's experiences in life, illustrating how difficult transitions are eased by familiar connections and cherished mementos.
628	9492	4	3	I think the author concludes this part of the story because he wanted to let the reader know that this wasn’t it for the little girl, and she wasn’t going to give up on planting flowers. Even though it didn’t work as well as she hoped during the winter, she wasn’t going to let that stop her. The author is trying to say that if something doesn’t work out the first time, keep on trying; maybe something different will happen, and she will continue trying when spring comes and the snow melts, to see how the flowers will do.
629	9493	4	3	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with, “When they come back take that test again.” She does this to show that she still has hope, and won’t just give up. She went through a lot when she moved, and seemed to have a sense of depression in the story. After all her sadness within the story, she finally gets the energy back to tell herself, keep trying. “I will take that test again” shows hope. And ""in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept."" She is obviously upset because the plant reminds her of home, and the greenhouse offers a space for her emotions. As a conclusion, I thought that it was a very wise choice to end the passage with a positive attitude, suggesting resilience in the face of displacement."
630	9494	4	3	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One reason is because it leaves you knowing that Saeng will never give up trying, even when faced with hardship and uncertainty about the future. Another reason is that something as simple as a flower, a symbol of hope and resilience, can encourage someone to keep going even if they feel like they have nothing to go for. Saeng says that flower is something so important, representing beauty and perseverance in a difficult world, that working harder will encourage her to keep doing the best she can in her circumstances. The author leaves you with this sentence because it is very powerful and brings Saeng courage, suggesting that even in the face of adversity, there is always a reason to strive for a better tomorrow.
631	9495	4	3	The author concludes the story with this because she failed the test already and wanted to pass it next time, so she doesn't disappoint her mother. She knew how much her mother valued academic success and the potential opportunities it could unlock. Passing the test wasn't just about grades; it was about upholding her mother's expectations and showing her that she was capable. This desire to avoid disappointing her mother fueled her determination to improve and succeed in the future.
632	9496	4	3	I think what the narrator means by saying this is that she wants to come back when everything is beautiful again. She wants to wait for all of the snow to melt and the geese to return so she can see all the colors of the flowers, suggesting a longing for renewal and a return to vibrancy after a period of dormancy. And if she passes her test this time, she will get to drive past all the flowers; this shows her desire to finally experience the beauty she's been missing, indicating that this journey holds personal significance and a sense of accomplishment.
633	9497	4	3	The author of this story ends the story with this paragraph because it explains how Saeng will not give up, just as the hibiscus does not. Earlier in the story, it explains how the winter hibiscus, though seemingly fragile, does not die. In the paragraph, when it says, the snows melt, this means that the difficult times, like the harsh winters Saeng faces with his exams, will eventually pass, and the seasons will keep going, just as Saeng should keep going and trying. Also when the author says and the geese return, this means that the geese, like opportunities, will keep coming back just as Saeng should keep trying to take the test and achieve his goals. Therefore, the hibiscus, the melting snow, and the returning geese all symbolize hope and perseverance for Saeng.
634	9498	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. He really liked the hopeful determination in those lines, a promise of resilience fueled by the changing seasons and the promise of renewal.
635	9499	4	3	I think the author concludes that paragraphs help to show more meaning of the story. The author could have wanted to show more details in the story by using paragraphs to separate ideas and emphasize specific points. This allows for a deeper exploration of the narrative, enriching the reader's understanding. Ultimately, the strategic use of paragraphs contributes to a more nuanced and impactful storytelling experience.
636	9500	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show how she will start over by retaking the test, just as the hibiscus will start over by budding new flowers. Saeng shows us how she will try to overcome the obstacles she must face, just like the hibiscus flower and geese will overcome the winter migration. In the story, the author makes the hibiscus represent the way to adjust to the changes in life, symbolizing resilience. In a way, the winter hibiscus represents Saeng because the flower is adapting to circumstances, the circumstance being winter's chill. Just like the hibiscus flower, Saeng must overcome her obstacles of being in a new country, and retaking her drivers exam, demonstrating her own ability to adapt and persevere.
637	9501	4	3	ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î is the paragraph that the author uses to conclude the story. In my opinion, the author includes this paragraph to conclude the story in order to show Saeng is committed to adjusting to her new home and to leaving her old one. For example, in the story Saeng was unable to say ìI mean, not like the kind we had at home.î without bursting into tears, revealing how much she misses her old life. But her vow to retake the test signifies a willingness to persevere despite her difficulties, showing her resolve to build a future where she currently is.
638	9502	4	3	The author could have finished the story with that paragraph for many reasons. He/she probably finished with the paragraph to show that Saeng cared about adapting to her new place and was not a failure or quiter, demonstrating her resilience. The author also probably finished the story this way to show that Saeng was determined for success and to make her mother happy, highlighting her motivation. This is why the author finished the story with the paragraph.
639	9503	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is given a small glimmer of hope by the winter hibiscus. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland, Vietnam, which pleases her and offers a connection to her past. Also, the fact that the hibiscus she purchases can survive winter, unlike the hibiscus of her homeland, symbolizes Saeng’s determination to adapt to her new country and its challenges. The future of the hibiscus, and its potential to bloom even in a foreign climate, symbolizes Saeng’s survival and adaptation to her new country, which will include her retaking her driving test with renewed resolve.
640	9504	4	3	The author concludes her story with this statement for many reasons. First, the Hibiscus will be strong again when the wind stops blowing, therefore, Saeng will be strong too, resilient like the flower itself. Also, Saeng is giving herself time to adjust and get used to her new surroundings, acknowledging that healing takes time. She is setting a real goal for herself, something tangible to look forward to. Saeng is identifying with the flower, seeing her own potential for renewal in its eventual recovery. It gives her comfort and brings back valuable memories of the things she loved and the things that made her happy, like her home country, and her grandmother's nurturing presence. This connection to her past provides hope for her future.
641	9505	4	3	"The author of this story concludes it with this paragraph to show Saengís determination. I say this hibiscus in the story, she sees the plant and is overjoyed to see it, but the reminder of doing her grandmother’s hair she tries to ignore. She knows this as a test for herself. She wants to see if she could be on her own and try not to dwell on the past. When she isn’t home, she said, ""I failed the test."" This shows that what she wants is to move on, but it isn’t as easy as she hoped it to be. So when she sees this hibiscus that shows life, this paragraph shows that Saeng is trying to move on, and she is different to a English her seal, highlighting her resilient spirit."
642	9506	4	3	In the story, I believe Saeng is sad because she misses her home and the hibiscus flower. She ends the story off well because she can now have a sense of peace with herself by waiting to take the test again. I believe that's why she ended the story like she did so she doesn’t leave herself worried or angry. She can turn a negative attitude into a positive one when she says she will retake the test when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, allowing her to find solace in the natural cycle and look forward with renewed hope.
643	9507	4	3	"The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: ""I mean, not like the kind we had @NUM1at-î."" This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows that Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept it, signaling a shift towards embracing her new reality and suggesting a hopeful outlook for her future despite the initial sadness. This is the reason for the author to conclude his story like he does."
644	9508	4	3	Many authors end their stories in different ways. But Minfong Ho ended hers with almost a saying. One reason she ended her story this way was she kinda revealed what would happen to Saeng in the future. Like in the end it says “I will take that test again.” This lets the reader know that the author might write another story about Saeng but it is when she takes the test again, offering a glimpse into a potential future narrative. A second example is showing that Saeng is strong and beautiful but will try again. This is show when the author said “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” emphasizing resilience and hope for a fresh start. See she said this hibiscus which is referring to Saeng. Without some of these writings techniques and hints we might not know if there will be a sequal and what might happen, leaving the ending open to interpretation and suggesting possibilities for Saeng's continued journey.
645	9509	4	3	They author must have put this in the story to show change. For all giving things is we give we do them we replemise the author. People dont think about the small damages, there nuste comrade with the big changes. The small ones count the turnig sioteero & I have to bind as for. On top of that the old anges to drive. We all go through harsh big & small, but we need to over come them all, highlighting that even seemingly insignificant shifts contribute to overall transformation and personal resilience.
646	9510	4	3	This is a very important paragraph for the narrator to put in the story. For instance, Saeng is saying that her new home with her flowers is more important than school and a test. And, Saeng doesn’t have many friends to go see at school, but her hibiscus will remind her of all of her old friends she made. Saeng is simply stating to herself that once everything is back to normal, or the way she wants to see it, then she can take that test again. In conclusion, the narrator used this paragraph to let us know how Saeng feels, and what truly matters to her during this period of transition.
647	9511	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it concludes, and wraps up the story. It shows the relationship between nature, adapting, and how this all calmed her down after failing the test. The rustling leaves and the resilience of the trees mirrored her own need to adjust and move forward, finding a sense of peace in the face of disappointment, thus bringing a sense of closure to her emotional journey.
648	9512	4	3	The author concludes this story with a sentence like this because at the end of winter into spring the snow will melt and the trees and flowers will blossom into different colored flowers. After all the flowers had blossomed the leaves had come out and then the pollen had found the right kind of trees. At the end of summer into fall the leaves start to die and change color, then the leaves will fall off. Then it snows all over again, completing the cycle of seasons.
649	9513	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,î because it shows that Saeng isnít going to stay down. It shows that the hibiscus will overcome winter, like Saengís mother says,ì'Öbut its strong enough to make it Through the cold months here, This winter hibiscus Thatís what matters.î This symbolizes Saeng overcoming not only failing the driverís test, but also moving to America. She isnít the same as she was back home, but sheís strong enough to get Through This change in her life. Also, taking the test in the spring symbolizes starting over, when everything is new, and she has overcome her winter. This ending paragraph is so important because it shows Saengís promise to herself that she will get past the challenges in front of her, and have good things to come. When Saeng says ì...When the snows melt...î it symbolizes the time in her life when her failures will become good again. She will take the test with a new out look on her life. The author concludes the story with This paragraph because it shows that Saeng isnít going to stay down, but is instead choosing to persevere and look forward to a brighter future.
650	9514	4	3	Where Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. Minpong Ho did so because she failed the test. Saeng failed to find the fine-toothed comb, the hibiscus hedge, the well, and her gentle grandmother. Apparently, these things could be found after the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding, offering a renewed chance to connect with the essence of the test and perhaps, this time, to succeed where she had previously faltered.
651	9515	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng's outlook on the future. It is a fitting conclusion, drawing from numerous elements in the story, and it shows how Saeng has grown. Saeng refers to ""When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" In this phrase she shows a growing acceptance and even an affection for her new homeland, a place that once felt alien. The geese are ""familiar to Saeng now"" despite her thinking of them as ""strange before,"" highlighting her gradual adaptation. The hibiscus is a piece of her past, a symbol of home, adapted to fit her current situation and blooming in a new environment. Saeng's vow that she will ""take that test again"" in the spring, ""When the snows melt…"" etc., shows that despite losing so much - her home, her grandmother, her way of life - Saeng is still determined to make the best of her situation, embracing resilience. She plans on passing her driving test come spring, no matter what obstacles she faces. The concluding paragraph is a fitting way to wrap up the story, showing how the threads of Saeng's past and her present are entwined, and displaying her determined attitude towards the future. With its optimistic words, the final paragraph neatly ties up the mood of optimism amidst regret, showcasing the character's strength. The author's wording was very well done, leaving the reader with a sense of hope for Saeng's future."
652	9516	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story says ""I will take that test again,"" suggesting she's trying to see how much she has adjusted to changes in life. In the story, it also states ""when they come back,"" concluding that when the flowers come back next season, she will see how much she remembers about her homeland, her grandma, and the good things, essentially using the recurring bloom as a personal benchmark for memory and adaptation."
653	9517	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because they wanted the reader to know there will be another story that will be made up. Also to show that Saeng was not happy that the snow melted and the geese return and the hibiscus was budding, suggesting her longing for the winter landscape and perhaps hinting at future adventures or a continuation of her emotional journey in a different season, thus leaving the audience anticipating what comes next.
654	9518	4	3	Now that she knows a lot about plants the narrator makes it seem like the girl is interested in nature. The new world and different plants that bloom and look so beautiful in the season, so the way I see it is that the girl really enjoys the plants and their characteristics; to me I say she is an adventurous girl who likes to explore new worlds and see what is out there to be explained. She seems driven by curiosity and a desire to understand the natural world around her. This makes her enthusiasm for plants not just a simple interest, but an indication of her broader adventurous spirit.
655	9519	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome her weaknesses and succeed in her new home. What the quote ""In the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" means is she'll try the placement test again, a new test to make her feel more comfortable where she's at and what she can learn from it. It emphasizes her resilience and determination to integrate, suggesting a hopeful future where she embraces challenges and thrives."
656	9520	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The first reason is to show that Saeng is a determined young girl. By vowing to take the ""test"" again, she shows she is determined and not giving up, illustrating her resilience in the face of setbacks and her commitment to achieving her goals. Another reason is because the author wanted to emphasize the importance of the idea of Saeng's personality, highlighting her strong will and unwavering spirit as key aspects of her character, ultimately leaving the reader with a lasting impression of her inner strength."
657	9521	4	3	Minfong Ho concluded the story with this because it shows Saeng’s determination to pass the driver's test. The fact that she failed it made her feel bad, and brought out feelings of homesickness, especially as the winter hibiscus reminded her of Laos. But in this final paragraph, observing the flower's resilience, she vows that she will overcome all her challenges of being in an unfamiliar place and pull herself together to accomplish her goal, just as the winter hibiscus blooms even in harsh conditions, symbolizing her own potential for growth and adaptation.
658	9522	4	3	The author included this sentence in the paragraph because Saeng was a very determined girl. She would keep trying till she got it right, pushing through any obstacle. No matter how long or hard it would be she would get it done, fueled by an inner resilience. Just like from the picture of the Hibiscus flower next to the highway. It certainly looked out of place, but it would do anything to survive, a testament to its tenacity. Being strong at times when you can only depend on yourself is hard to do, but Saeng is determined from her loss and the perfection of the Hibiscus flower, drawing strength from its unlikely beauty and perseverance.
659	9523	4	3	In the concluding statement Saeng states that ìwhen they come back In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.î The author concludes the story with this passage because she is using the hibiscus as an example of survival. The hibiscus is from another place like her, and she is using it to represent her well being in the new place. In a way she is saying, if the hibiscus survives this winter, than so will I. This connection between her fate and the plant's highlights her vulnerability. She uses this as a conclusion to depict her unsure nature towards her new home and her ability to adapt.
660	9524	4	3	I believe the author uses this as the last paragraph because it tells of how Saeng wants to overcome and be strong even though she misses her home. For example, Saeng believed that since she cried when she saw the hibiscus plant, a reminder of her homeland, she felt she failed some personal test of resilience. This final sentiment, that she believes she will get stronger over time, offers a sense of hope and determination, suggesting she will persevere despite the challenges of being away from home, ultimately concluding her journey on a note of personal growth.
661	9525	4	3	The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to sum up the realization and determination Saeng obtains. Initially, Saeng is upset after failing her test. Seeing the flower and seeking it out at a shop overwhelms her with a reminder of her old home. This small flower makes her realize how much she misses her old home, making buying it a necessity. She likely feels that the flower will provide a piece of home in this newer world. Realizing the importance of memories and seeing the flower's determination to survive a cold winter, she gains the determination to retake the test, drawing faith from the flower's survival and her renewed appreciation for cherished memories. Ultimately, the ending paragraph reveals these messages, showing Saeng’s evolved perspective and her commitment to persevere.
662	9526	4	3	The reason the author was inspired was because of the flower. The flower, small and resilient, had the ability to survive harsh winters and adapt to new environments, blooming vibrantly each spring despite the odds. She decides that she was going to overcome its obstacles just as the flower overcomes its obstacles every winter, drawing strength from its quiet perseverance and using it as a model for her own challenges.
663	9527	4	3	Memory, promise, life-all are ideas that explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Memories is one idea that helps explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph because Saeng misses her old life and country, and planting the hibiscus connects her to those cherished times. Promise is another idea because Saeng makes a vow that once spring comes again she will take the test again, showing her commitment to her future goals. Life is another idea because Saeng brought the flower and planted so it can live once spring has come and she said then she will retake the test, symbolizing her hope and resilience. Memories, promise, and life help explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Memories will come back in the spring along with the promises she has made and the life that wants to start, and Saeng is doing this by planting the hibiscus which brings back a lot of her memories from her life, reinforcing the cyclical nature of hope and renewal.
664	9528	4	3	The author concludes the story with that statement because it had gotten colder, a chill wind now blowing through the garden, and all the plants and flowers, once vibrant with life, were inevitably going to die with the coming frost.
665	9529	4	3	I think the author concludes the saying at the top because she was very eager on passing the test. She told herself and vowed to take the test again when the geese return and the snow melts. Another reason I think the author concludes this is because she failed it the first time, and it is a big thing for her, showing how eager she is to pass it and prove her determination. That is why I think the author added this to the story, emphasizing her strong desire and future commitment.
666	9530	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng had failed her driver's test. As she walked home, disheartened, she spied a vibrant hibiscus flower at a roadside stand. Its bright color reminded her of her faraway home. She bought the flower and returned to her new home where her mother was already working in the garden, tending to the unfamiliar plants. Together, they decided to plant the winter hibiscus in their garden, hoping it would thrive. As they finished planting, a flock of geese flew overhead, honking as they headed south for the winter. Saeng then realized that everything was becoming familiar; the initial strangeness was fading. She concludes the story saying that when the geese come back in the spring, a sign of renewal and return, she will take the test again. She says that by then, the flower will be buckling, meaning blooming and growing, and she, too, will have grown and become familiar with everything, so she will be ready for the test when the geese are ready to come home and the hibiscus is ready to bloom, symbolizing her own readiness and belonging.
667	9531	4	3	The author does this because they are comparing to the plant. The author does this because when the plant starts to bloom then the character’s confidence will come back. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it gives the story some meaning and offers a sense of hope for the future.
668	9532	4	3	The Author concludes this story With the final paragraph to emphasize the story and make it seem more interesting as to make the reader want the story to keep going on to find out what happens next, leaving the reader with a sense of anticipation about the characters' future endeavors and the mysteries that still need solving. This technique of leaving questions unanswered effectively hooks the reader and creates a desire to learn more.
669	9533	4	3	I think this Author put this last paragraph in this story to show everyone how determined she is to pass this test and how much it means to her to do it; the final words likely emphasize her unwavering commitment and the personal significance she attaches to achieving success, thereby solidifying the reader's understanding of her resolve.
670	9534	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because it shows the connection of nature and the girl. The paragraph says, ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". In spring when all of these events take place, spring is the sign of life and birth or renewal. The geese come back; they are ""renewed"" in a symbolic sense. When the snow melts you can see the grass again which is a sign of life. When plants bud they are born. The character decides when nature is symbolically reborn and renewed she will start again just like nature, suggesting a powerful alignment between her personal journey and the cyclical rhythms of the natural world, reinforcing the theme of resilience and new beginnings."
671	9535	4	3	He concludes the story with his paragraph because he wanted to say that he was going to take the test again when it was not the winter, @CAPS1 and show how Saeng vowed to herself by saying that he or she will take the test again when it is not winter because even @CAPS2 the test was not passed in winter and could have been passed during when there snow melted in the ground, demonstrating a renewed determination to succeed under more favorable circumstances, thereby ending the story on a note of hopeful perseverance.
672	9536	4	3	In the story the author included that concluding paragraph because if you had read the rest of the story you would know that the person was talking about when she comes back that she wanted to take the test again because it would be such nicer weather then it was the first time she took it, another reason why I believe the author added this conclusion paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if they really did understand the novel and what she was really going for in the novel, perhaps highlighting the character’s resilience or subtle humor. So the author first wanted to make shore the reader would understand the ending of the book better with that conclusion paragraph at the end. These are the reason why I think the author added that concluding paragraph at the very end of that novel, ultimately ensuring the reader grasped the narrative's nuances.
673	9537	4	3	Because they wanted to get it done with so they made the end like the first part of the story. I like the part when the birds came back; they got some of the flowers to come back to them. It felt like a hopeful return after a long absence, making the ending more satisfying.
674	9538	4	3	Saeng and her mother have to be determined to try their best in order to survive. Having been through a lot, when Saeng failed the @CAPS1 test, she was more depressed than before. The author concludes this story with this paragraph to give readers the thought of how it is to be determined to adapt and survive in a different place, and though Saeng and her mother are away from their homeland they still enjoy the things they did in Vietnam, like the flowers, and the hot peppers and bitter melons. Even though her friends disagree with the taste, it doesn't stop her from enjoying what she loves most, demonstrating their resilience and the importance of holding onto cultural traditions in the face of adversity.
675	9539	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she will not stop trying and one day she will pass that test. She made a vow to herself that shows determination to overcome. It also makes us want to read more and find out if she tests her vow and if she passed the test. For example it ends in ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return and take the test again,"" leaving the reader hopeful for her future success."
676	9540	4	3	The author concluded the story like this because she had another view of Saeng. He would think that every season that she would be in a different mood, and that the garden would change, so that Saeng's mom would always be outside for every season, finding solace and connection in the ever-evolving beauty of her garden.
677	9541	4	3	The author concludes this story with the paragraph because she is proving how something from a memory can make someone determined. For example, Saeng failed her driverís test but upon reaching the hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her old home, triggering a wave of nostalgia. Also, while she is planting the plant, she sees the geese with a new familiarity, recognizing a piece of her present life connecting with her past. This combined makes her determined to complete her test because having two reminders of both homes, the old and the new, it comforts her to know that she can adapt easily and treasure her memories as well, ultimately finding strength in her roots to face future challenges.
678	9542	4	3	he was saying that you should not give up and that you should keep trying, persevering with the same tenacity, like the plants in the spring time, pushing through the cold earth towards the sun. He used the analogy of new shoots emerging, reminding us that even after the harshest winters, life finds a way to bloom again. The speaker's encouragement served as a reminder that persistence, even when faced with adversity, ultimately leads to growth and fruition.
679	9543	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because she is making a promise to herself to take the test again so she can pass it. She will do it when it is spring and the hibiscus is budding, a time of renewal and hope. She needs to take the test and start driving, gaining her independence. I think that is a good thing to do when people vow things to themselves, setting goals and striving to achieve them.
680	9544	4	3	He is referring to the lifestyle of Saeng and the stuff they do. It's a life likely filled with outdoor activities, given the probable warm, sunny climate of the region. This likely involves enjoying the natural landscapes and a more relaxed pace of life, emphasizing community and connection with the environment. Overall, it presents a picture of contentment rooted in simplicity.
681	9545	4	3	The author decided to finish the story with that phrase to show that she will wait for her next year and do all this over again. She will be waiting for it and do all this over again, embracing the challenges and anticipation. She will be waiting for it and prove that she can do it one more time and that she is used to live there now, demonstrating her resilience and adaptation to this place she now calls home, signifying a cyclical return and a growing sense of belonging.
682	9546	4	3	The author concludes this story like that to show a new beginning in the spring. Like how flowers bloom and bud in spring, signifying rebirth and growth, she will become a new, better person. This symbolic parallel between the season and her personal transformation suggests hope and the potential for positive change as she moves forward. That is why the author concludes the story like this, emphasizing the cyclical nature of life and the promise of renewal.
683	9547	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will try the test again and get a fresh new start. Also, I think that it's showing the reader if you fail something the first time, don't be afraid to go back and try it again. I also think that the hibiscus symbolizes her because she failed the test in the winter and doesn't like what she's in. But in the spring, when the hibiscus has buds on it, she's going to have a fresh start on the test, and the flower will have a new environment to survive in, suggesting a hopeful outlook for her future endeavors.
684	9548	4	3	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesn't come out and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, that's for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then, creating suspense. The ending to the story can be anything you want it to be, it is up for interpretation; this open-endedness allows for diverse readings. To different people it could mean different things, offering a personalized experience and ultimately empowering the reader.
685	9549	4	3	The author ended the story with that paragraph because that paragraph says when she is going to try to take the test again and contemplate potential changes in her evolving life. For example she is sad in the story because she failed the test and wants to go home, signifying her disappointment and desire to return to the familiar. If she passes in the spring, a success that could alter her path, she might try to make changes and embrace living here, suggesting a willingness to consider a different future. This is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and anticipation for what the future may hold.
686	9550	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is finally comfortable with her new “home.” After the passage is mostly a reflection of Saeng’s old life, it ends this way to signify that she has become accustomed to her new way of life. For example, it says “in the spring, and the geese return…” that shows that she is now used to the geese and the nature of her new world. The author also uses that paragraph at the end to show a sense of release. Saeng had so many memories locked inside her old life, that she couldn’t grasp new ones in her new home. The author’s use of this paragraph is a good way to close out the story because it lets the reader feel the relaxed scene of the birds flying away; Saeng escaping her pain and becoming a real part of her new world, illustrating her successful integration and emotional healing in this new chapter.
687	9551	4	3	This last paragraph reveals something special to the reader. Saeng was given new hope winter mothers understanding and the hibiscus plant. She felt hopeless, miserable and incomparable upon seeing the hibiscus that reminded her of her homeland. When she came home, however, seeing the roots of the plant buried in the ground gave her new determination. The flower represents her, showing how it adapted to be able to survive in cold weather, or hard times, in Saeng's case. The roots are her past and although they are buried, they are not forgotten. The actual flower represents a new life for Saeng in a new country. The author, Minfong Ho, used personification, humanizing non-living things, to enrich the story's symbolism, further emphasizing the hibiscus's role in Saeng's transformation and her connection to both her past and future. Through this, Ho uses the paragraph to effectively convey Saeng's renewed sense of self and purpose.
688	9552	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to show Saeng’s determination. It is also relating the driver's test to the hibiscus plant, suggesting a parallel between her personal growth and the natural world. It is saying that when everything else starts coming to life, she will also accomplish something. She needs the motivation of her surroundings to push her. Throughout the story, Saeng is affected by her surroundings. For example, when she’s in the greenhouse, it takes her back to her childhood, “It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery.... Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back to into her childhood world.” This connection to the natural world, and her past, highlights how external elements influence her internal drive and ultimately contribute to her resolve to succeed.
689	9553	4	3	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng finds comfort in the plant after failing her test. The hibiscus reminds her of her home and connects her with past experiences, offering a sense of familiarity in a new environment. Even though she initially failed, she feels that diligent study and another attempt will lead to success. This resilience mirrors the hibiscus, which seemingly dies in winter but returns beautifully in spring. Saeng feels a connection with the plant's rebirth and believes she, too, can start anew and excel on the test. That is why the author includes the paragraph where Saeng vows to retake the test when spring arrives and the hibiscus blossoms again, symbolizing her hope and determination for a fresh start."
690	9554	4	3	"The author concludes the story saying, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author ended it like that because Saeng is basically saying a more opportune time will come for her to take that test, and she will pass it then with renewed belief in herself and in the cyclical nature of life that promises renewal and second chances."
691	9555	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as a way to say that in due season she will take the test that she failed in the belief that the hibiscus will help her to overcome the obstacles. She bought the plant, it seems, when she failed the test, hoping that with the blossoming of the plant, it will give her a timetable as to when she is ready to try again, signifying her personal growth and readiness for future challenges.
692	9556	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a meaningful summary of the events in the story. Everything that happened to Saeng while she was at the florist is summed up into something resembling vengeance, a quiet determination. The whole reason that Saeng was sad in the first place was that she failed her driving test, a disappointment that cast a shadow over her. In the final paragraph, she vows to take the test again when the hibiscus buds. The hibiscus that Saeng bought will begin budding in the spring, when the snows melt. The last paragraph of the story gives room for Saeng to deal with her nostalgia over the winter season, providing a framework for her emotional journey. Finally, the geese that fly south make Saeng feel sad, but they light a spark within her; she tells herself that she will take the driving test again when the geese return, when the hibiscus buds, and when the snows melt, signifying a renewed sense of hope and purpose as she looks toward the future.
693	9557	4	3	In the last paragraph they trying to express what is coming. When winter is over spring will come which means the hibiscus will come back and it will be like home. Also the geese will return and because of that she will take the quiz again. To her it’s like starting all over and hopefully she will pass. Also she loves the hibiscus and since that’s back maybe she will do so much better. Overall a new time is coming, a season of renewal and second chances that promises a fresh start and renewed hope for success.
694	9558	4	3	"I think the author of “Winter Hibiscus” finished with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" because it is showing us the importance of the plant and how it will help her pass. It also symbolizes that when the plant buds and fights all the obstacles to survive, then she will beat the obstacles to pass her driving test. For example, in the story it says ""When the snows melt and then geese return"" the author is relating that to Saeng and her struggle to pass her test with these struggle in survive the winter. It also says “Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly seeing into the distance.” This quote is saying she will rise to her challenge, and overcome it, just like the geese migrating back. All in all, this quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is holding then I will take that test again,"" shows the similar struggles between the flower, Saeng and the geese, demonstrating their resilience in overcoming challenges and finishing what they started."
695	9559	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has meaning. The author is saying that when these animals and living creatures get their chance she too, will get hers. For example, the geese will get to return, the hibiscus will get it's chance to bud and she will get her chance to take her driver's test. I know this because Saeng's mother starts talking about how great the plant will be in the spring. She even says, ""But it's strong enough to make it through the cold months."" This indicates that the mom is trying to tell her that she will get a second chance, just like the hibiscus. That is why the story ends with that sentence, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and anticipation for Saeng's future success."
696	9560	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it describes the cyclical nature of the seasons, how they change, come, and go, starting with a new season that then transforms into something different. I think that's why the story is titled ""Winter Hibiscus,"" because after spring comes winter, and in spring there are nice, beautiful flowers with good smells. When spring is gone, it's winter, so all the plants have died out and won't be the same as they used to be, highlighting the transient beauty and inevitable change inherent in life, much like the hibiscus itself."
697	9561	4	3	In ìWinter Hibiscus,î by @CAPS1 Ho, Saeng does not give up; she keeps trying. The author concludes the story with a small paragraph that has an extraordinary meaning. ìÖin the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,î by saying this, Saeng shows to never give up, to give new things a fair chance, and to always remember her homeland and the resilience it instilled in her. The author ended the story in such an inspiring way because it strengthens the theme of perseverance and hope. There is a lot to be learned from only a few words, showing Saeng's commitment to her goals and her unwavering spirit.
698	9562	4	3	The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity. Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in America and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to America while remembering her old home in Vietnam, ultimately suggesting a hopeful outlook for her future.
699	9563	4	3	The author concludes the sentence on the end to state when the plants start over growing and the geese come back, she will try again. For example, the plants have to grow their petals back after winter's harshness, and the geese have to rebuild their nests and find reliable food sources in the spring. The author is saying she will take the test again when the geese come back and the plants grow again, implying a cyclical return to favorable conditions for success.
700	9564	4	3	The author wrote the paragraph because she went back inside the house to get dinner and wasn’t going to see the garden until another day, and because winter was coming, meaning she wouldn't play outside anymore until it was over. This connects to her statement, “In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” That quotation explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, suggesting a cyclical return to her challenges and joys with the changing seasons.
701	9565	4	3	I would have to say that the reason that the narrator ended with this is because it is kind of a solution, if you think about it, offering a potential resolution to the problem presented in the story. And you don’t put the solution anywhere else but the end; that is why she put it there, leaving the reader with a sense of closure and a path forward.
702	9566	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph by the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she found a hobby to look forward to. The image of 'the winter hibiscus' being planted 'in the ground now' symbolizes Saeng's renewed hope and willingness to nurture something new in her life. The act of Saeng carefully tending to it, as she 'tamped down the soil around it,' reinforces her active participation in creating a positive future. The final detail, 'overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by,' adds a sense of freedom and forward movement, mirroring Saeng's own journey. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, leaving the reader with a feeling of optimism for Saeng's future endeavors.
703	9567	4	3	The author ended the story with that specific quote because it shows the grasp in understanding the beauty & marvels of nature. Saeng spent a lot of money to buy a distinct flower called dok faeng-nol. Saeng was taking a driver's test a liscence but was failing it, and during her test she found that plant. Ashamed that she failed the test, she still showed her mother the flower she found, which was not like the one at home. Her mother is pleased with the flowers and understands that Saeng failed her test. Her mother said about the flower, ìIts flowers arenít as pretty, but itís strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That what matters that was a figurative speech that there's hope for Saeng to pass her test again when she her learned more refined and is ready to try again. And with the geese flying away for the winter and coming back in the spring signifies a fresh new start at success, as the mother's words highlight the inherent strength and resilience in the seemingly less beautiful flower, mirroring Saeng's potential for future success.
704	9568	4	3	The author concludes this way because when it gets warm and nice outside, they will go to take the test again since it is too nasty outside now, making focusing difficult and creating an unfavorable testing environment. They're postponing until conditions improve.
705	9569	4	3	It is actually a very powerful last statement. Even though she failed her driver’s test, she has realized that she will just have to keep being strong and be patient. Soon the geese will come back and the snow will melt, and she will “return” to take her test and will be determined to pass. Saeng bought the hibiscus to feel as if she were back in Vietnam and felt as if it could fill that place in her heart where she misses it. “I paid nineteen dollars for it,” she says it like she was disappointed in failing the test but also that saying which is free back in Vietnam was so expensive in the United States, emphasizing the stark contrast between her past and present life. A hibiscus flower is tropical, so when it blooms in the spring will be when she becomes ready to give the test a second try, symbolizing her own personal renewal and readiness to embrace new beginnings.
706	9570	4	3	The author concludes the story with this ending because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test, but she knows she can do it, just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. The plant's resilience mirrors her own potential for perseverance. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that symbolic image, suggesting hope and the possibility of future success rooted in inner strength.
707	9571	4	3	"In my opinion, the author concludes the story by saying that she will retake the drivers test because not only will she take the drivers test again, but she will also be more comfortable in her life. The drivers test is not the main problem; itís adapting to her new environment that is causing Saeng so much heartache. For example, in lines @NUM1 Saengís thoughtís are ""A wave of loss so deep and strong stang Saengës eyes now and swept over her ìandî in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng brake down and wept."" This depicts that Saeng is having trouble readjusting to her new life and is reminded of her old memories from where she used to live and cries because itís gone. Failing the test also underscores her feelings of inadequacy in this new place, as she is unable to perform a task that seems simple for others. I think that failing her drivers test was just little thing that finally caused her to cry because of the stress, and when she said ìand this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again,î it means that she will overcome all that and move on. The blooming hibiscus symbolizes hope and new beginnings, suggesting Saeng will find the strength to face her challenges and build a fulfilling life in her new home."
708	9572	4	3	It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved the hibiscus, so when spring came and the hibiscus would bloom, it would be the best time to take that test again, having already failed it once. Seeing the vibrant hibiscus might lift her spirits and probably make her more confident to take the driving test again at the right time. So, in conclusion, that’s why the author concludes that paragraph in the story, highlighting the connection between Saeng's emotional state and the blooming hibiscus, suggesting a renewed sense of hope and determination.
709	9573	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this because she is saying that she is going to grow with the season's change. She is in a new country and just failed her driver's test, leaving her feeling dejected, but the hibiscus reminds her of being back home. In the story, Saeng's mother says, ""I've seen this kind blooming along the lake; it's strong enough to make it through the winter."" Saeng can relate to that sentiment, understanding that if the flower can make it through the winter, then she, too, can persevere and thrive in a new country."
710	9574	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author finishes the story with this last paragraph, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.” The author finishes the story with that paragraph because in the beginning, Saeng had purchased a hibiscus plant because it had reminded her of her hometown. (“Plants that she had not realized that she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world”) So she purchased it, but since there was bad weather at the time, Saeng had to get the plant back in time and plant it in the garden. But she failed, missing the deadline for the test. That is why it says “I will take that test again,” showing her resolve. And she will take it again during the spring when the hibiscus blooms once again, symbolizing a fresh start and renewed hope. That is why the author finished the story with that paragraph, linking Saeng's personal growth to the natural cycle of the hibiscus.
711	9575	4	3	The author concludes the paragraph like this because it shows that she is not going to give up. I like this because she vowed silently to herself that she was going to take the test again during the spring; this resilience, coupled with the mentioned challenges, underscores why the author concludes the paragraph with such determination, highlighting her unwavering spirit.
712	9576	4	3	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" is written by Minfong Ho. The author ended the story with this excerpt, ""When they come back,"" Saeng vowed silently to herself, ""in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" The reason for this is so she will have time to adjust to her new environment. Saeng just needs a little comforting because all of this is new to her, a new school, a new language, a new country. These words use figurative language because the geese reminded her of herself, ""Almost familiar to her now. Like geese."" They, like her, were newcomers, adapting to a foreign land, hinting at her own journey of assimilation and her hope for a fresh start."
713	9577	4	3	It is almost spring, like he said, showing melting and geese returning, and hibiscus is budding. Grass is growing, trees are budding, @CAPS1 birds are singing, heralding the warmer days ahead. With these signs, the promise of spring feels truly palpable.
714	9578	4	3	"In the story ìWinter Hibiscusî by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with an interesting paragraph. The paragraph saysî When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding  then I will take that test again. ""The author ended the story with that paragraph because she was not in her comfort zone, she had move to a new country and missed everything, like the familiar warmth and the hibiscus flower, elements that represented home. So she would wait until she felt more settled and comfortable again to retake the test, giving herself time to adjust to her new surroundings. In the text it states ìthrough the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.î She was realizing that it wasnít so bad & she was getting used to it, slowly building a new sense of normalcy and adapting to the rhythm of her new life in America. This suggests a growing acceptance and a preparedness to face challenges again, once she feels more grounded."
715	9579	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt & the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,î so that the audience has something to think about, it gives the story a little more of a dramatic effect. This cyclical promise, tied to the changing seasons and the return of life, leaves the reader pondering Saeng's resilience and determination, amplifying the emotional impact of her journey.
716	9580	4	3	The author concludes the story this way to show she will be alright, and remain determined despite the hardships she faces. The way she speaks of future times shows confidence that she will make it till spring, enduring the winter's challenges. The way she speaks of the test shows her determination to overcome obstacles and prove her strength. The use of the word “vowed” shows she will follow through with her statement, demonstrating her resolve and commitment to persevere.
717	9581	4	3	The author concluded the story with this sentence because she's letting people know that she enjoys nature more than school. The descriptions of the vibrant forest, the sounds of the birds, and the feeling of freedom she experiences while exploring contrast sharply with any mention of her academic life. This contrast ultimately highlights her preference, solidifying the idea that she finds greater fulfillment and joy in the natural world, leading her to value it above the structured environment of school.
718	9582	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because the flower is talked about all through the story, and the author emphasizes its significance by stating that when the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, making the hibiscus a symbol of hope and a fresh start.
719	9583	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because she is telling us what will happen beyond the story we are reading. It means when the snow melts, she’ll start all over again and rebuild the greenhouse, ready to face the next season with renewed hope and determination.
720	9584	4	3	"I think the author concludes the story the way she did to show determination. Saeng's resolve is highlighted. I also believe that it symbolizes adaption, when the season changes, as will Saeng; she will take the test again. The changing season mirrors her own transition. Everything will soon go back to normal and will adjust just like she will. The familiar surroundings offer comfort as ""everything is almost familiar to her now"" (@NUM1), signifying a return to equilibrium and suggesting her resilience in the face of challenges."
721	9585	4	3	The author concludes with this ending because it gives hope to the reader. It is like a happy ending to a sad story, offering a sense of resolution and optimism after the challenges presented. It is also her final thought for the story, carefully chosen to leave a lasting impression, and a good end point that provides closure and a feeling of satisfaction.
722	9586	4	3	The author concludes this paragraph in the story because that's when she starts growing plants again, and she wants to start over again, signifying a renewed sense of hope and purpose after a period of stagnation or loss. The act of nurturing new life reflects her own desire for personal growth and a fresh beginning, allowing the paragraph to end on a positive, forward-looking note.
723	9587	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it explains that Saeng will try again once spring comes around. For example, ""I failed the test,"" (Ho) shows that Saeng did fail the test, but she also thoughtfully got her mother a hibiscus to plant in her garden. Her mom feels bad about Saeng failing, so she cooks her favorite foods, like japchae, to comfort her and help her forget about failing, even if just for a little while. This is important because it makes Saeng feel a sense of comfort and relief, knowing she is supported and loved, and can therefore take the test again in confidence, strengthened by her mother's love and ready to face the challenge anew."
724	9588	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of some causes. Saeng vowed silently to herself, showing she has calmed down. She feels better in her new country. The imagery of the snows meeting and the geese returning suggests a sense of hope and renewal. Her determination to take the test again indicates she no longer feels defeated by it. She recognizes the opportunity for improvement and approaches it with a renewed perspective. This shift in feeling towards the test reflects a broader change in her perspective on her challenges. She now views her new country with different eyes, suggesting acceptance and optimism. All things, therefore, seem to be improving for her, providing a hopeful and resolved ending to the story.
725	9589	4	3	The author concludes the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to show that she will try again with a new start. When she sees the flower the clerk identifies it as a hibiscus. The hibiscus brings back fond memories of her childhood home. She then takes it home and excitedly shows the plant to her mother. Her mother replies with a surprised “You what?” hearing her daughter tell her how much it cost. With the hibiscus representing something of emotional importance, she acquires more hope. By saying she will start again once the flower has bloomed and the geese have returned, she means she will approach the test with renewed determination and a fresh start, symbolizing a hopeful future.
726	9590	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng's determination despite her sadness. She misses Vietnam, but she will take the test again next year, demonstrating her resolve. The author’s choice of words in the concluding paragraph convey a sense of hope and something to look forward to. In the story, Saeng is disappointed in herself for failing the test, but buying the plant helps her because it reminds her of home and provides comfort. The idea that Saeng is persistent and the hopeful tone of the story are expressed in this final paragraph, illustrating her resilience and suggesting a positive future despite current setbacks.
727	9591	4	3	"The author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because it appeared to be an important thought to ""Saeng"" and it was basically the main cause of everything, rather the main subject of the story. She also may have concluded the story with that particular paragraph because that was her last and final thought, or memory of her previous life / lifestyle before their present place of living, thus providing a poignant reflection."
728	9592	4	3	The author concludes the story with “In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” because Saeng fails the test by spending her money on a Big Mac and not having enough for the type of flower her mother sent for. So since Saeng failed the test, she wants to take the test again and make her mother happy. This shows Saeng's resolve to try again, hoping for a better outcome and to honor her mother's wishes when the season of renewal arrives.
729	9593	4	3	I believe that author ended the story with that sentence because it gives a lifting feeling after the story was so sad. Saeng missed her homeland and the familiar comforts of her culture, and this homesickness made her sad. She used the flowers as a small piece of home, offering a bit of relief from her feelings of displacement. The disappointment surrounding her driving test added to her woes, but she genuinely liked the plant and found solace in nurturing it. So the last sentence seemed to fit in as a comfort zone, a small victory and a symbol of hope, to make the reader feel a bit more relieved after witnessing Saeng's struggles.
730	9594	4	3	The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time “when the snow melts”. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, “Saeng broke down and wept!” The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. Therefore, as the “snow will melt” her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, Saeng refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country. She referred to the plant as “yet another old friend”. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also bloom because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using the symbolism of hope to illustrate how home that we can overcome. She is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge. Therefore, he uses all of that to make a hopeful home, revealing a life lesson of courage.
731	9595	4	3	The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî ends the story with this paragraph because it reveals the importance of the Winter Hibiscus. In the story Saeng moves from Vietnam and feels very homesick. She fails her drivers test and is very upset. When she sees the familiar plant she is reminded of her home in Vietnam. The Winter Hibiscus reminds Saeng of fond memories with her grandmother and simple things such as her fine. Toothed buffalo-horn comb and the hibiscus hedge that would leave soft red petals in her well water, little details she treasures. When seeing the familiar plant, ìSaeng felt a shock recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. îThis shows how important the hibiscus was to her and the deep connection she still has with her homeland. The author ended the story with that paragraph to show how the winter hibiscus is a comfort to Saeng and will encourage her to do better on her next driverís test, offering her a renewed sense of hope and connection to her past as she navigates her new life.
732	9596	4	3	"After reading ""Winter Hibiscus,"" I can tell that Saeng is a determined person and likes nature. I can also tell that she is determined to pass the test. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because, in the beginning of the story, Saeng fails her driving test. Disappointed, she walks home, and as she is walking, she comes across a familiar plant, the winter hibiscus. This discovery takes her back to her childhood world, offering a moment of comfort and reflection. Had she not failed the test, she would have never walked home and come across the plant. The author didn’t want us to forget the reason she walked home and experienced that poignant reconnection with her past. It would have never happened, highlighting the unexpected beauty that can arise from setbacks."
733	9597	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that next spring she will have another chance. The author shows that Saeng will relate to the blooms of the hibiscus plant and take the test again. The author does this to leave a cliffhanger, suggesting there is more to Saeng's life yet to come. In the story, Saeng is trying to get used to change and is having a hard time. Her mother's hope cheers her up, but just like winter comes, Saeng will have next spring to take the driver's test again, offering a sense of hope and anticipation for her future.
734	9598	4	3	When they come back, then I will take the test again because Saeng needs time just as the hibiscus to grow. Saeng didn't do well on a test but says she will try again after snow melts and the spring comes, bringing with it renewed hope. After moving, Saeng feels alone and wants to go back home, missing the familiar faces and places. However, she feels in her heart that she can try, given time to adjust and learn. The hibiscus reminds Saeng of the flower back in her home country, a vibrant symbol of resilience, and this helps her see that she has to let go of her past, embrace her new surroundings, and live in the now.
735	9599	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng being mature about it and being confident knowing she can take it again. The final paragraph emphasizes her resolve. When it says Saeng vowed silently to herself, reflecting on everything that had happened, the phrase suggests she is going to start over, but with a renewed sense of purpose forged by her recent experience. This quiet vow underlines her growth and resilience, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism for her future.
736	9600	4	3	The author concludes the story with a sentence about retaking her test when the geese are back and the hibiscus is budding because they each represent something else. The geese represent change because they change their environment in the winter just like Saeng changes her environment by going to the plant place, finding a new job, and adapting to a different culture. The hibiscus reminds her of home because at her home there are similar plants, and seeing them brings back memories of her family and familiar surroundings. The hibiscus budding represents a new life just like the one Saeng has to live in a new home, full of new opportunities and challenges. Overall, the sentence that the author ends with is used to show Saeng's life as compared to the geese and hibiscus, connecting her personal journey of adaptation and growth with the natural cycles of migration and renewal.
737	9601	4	3	Saeng was happy when the snow was disappearing because she couldn't wait for spring to come back to see the animals running around by her garden and seeing the beautiful geese flying in after their long & hard hibernation. So Saeng was excited to see everything grown back, including the rare herbs she needed, so she is guaranteed to pass the botany test this time.
738	9602	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was waiting for the winter time to be over. She knew the harsh cold would be too much for her precious hibiscus. After the winter time, Saeng was going to take the flower-growing test again, feeling more prepared this time, and she could finally plant the hibiscus. Saeng really liked this hibiscus, finding its vibrant color a source of joy, and she didn't want it to die in the winter time. Her patience showed her dedication to nurturing the delicate bloom.
739	9603	4	3	"The author concluded this story with this paragraph because she wanted to show how the flower gave the little girl strength. The girl was in a new place, and back at home where she is from, there are a lot of beautiful flowers that she loved to look at, and being in a new place that doesn't have these flowers really gets her down and has her upset. She misses her home so she is hurting, and the only thing that sort of comforts her a little bit are the flowers. For example, the girl says, ìItís-it's not a real one...I mean, not like the kind we had at..."", here she stops because she is so upset that she canít say home. The flower she has right now isn't real, but when the real one blossoms in the spring, seeing the flower will comfort her and give her confidence to retake the test, representing a renewed sense of hope and resilience in her new environment."
740	9604	4	3	"The authorís conclusion explains her feels. The author's conclusion says to me ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", what it means is that she is a new woman. For example, taking the test means that she will change. Also what it means is that she is ready to take on new things. For instance, the test to her is getting ready to take on a new thing. That's what I got from the conclusion, suggesting a readiness for transformation and new challenges in her life."
741	9605	4	3	The author ends with this paragraph to show that Saeng had hope. It shows that there is still hope for her future. The ending paragraph makes you kind of create your own ending for Saeng, imagining what becomes of her after all she's endured. I like to imagine Saeng with a big garden next to her, filled with the vegetables she learned about, and that she passes the test, finally achieving her dream.
742	9606	4	3	"I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph for several reasons. This final paragraph draws together and unites all the concluding ideas. It tells us that in the spring when everything is coming to life Saeng will find the strength to take the test again. These central ideas expressed in the last paragraph show how Saeng and her mother have adapted and that new things are started in the spring, as well as new possibilities. In the text it says, ìI know"", her mother said quietly. ìIíve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Itís flower arenít as pretty, but itís strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.î This means and represents that even though life is different here away from Saeng's home they will adapt and survive in their own way, demonstrating their resilience and hope for the future."
743	9607	4	3	"The author concludes the story the way she does because it shows that Saeng needs to heal from the failing of the test before she can take it again. Saeng already knows that she can heal. She realizes that she has gotten used to where she now lives, that things in her new land, like the sound of geese, are now ""familiar to her"". The narrator of the story says, ""...she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… almost familiar to her now."" Things in Saeng's new home had been strange to her at first, but she had healed and gotten used to them. Saeng has also healed from leaving her original home of Vietnam. She was sad to leave her home, ""A work so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."", but she had healed. Saeng remembers the flowers that she had known in Vietnam as ""old friends"", showing that it did not hurt her to remember them. This demonstrates her resilience and ability to adapt to new circumstances. When Saeng heals from failing her driving test, like she had healed when moving from Vietnam to the United States, she can re-visit the test, without pain and with a renewed sense of hope."
744	9608	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows the character, Saeng, was going to adapt to their new home and stay strong. I believe, when Saeng’s mother says, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus,” I think Saeng’s mother is also sort of thinking about Saeng. It's almost as if she’s saying that the move here scarred Saeng but she will be strong and survive the change like anyone who has failed a test, she will study more and try harder to pass it next time. Just like the winter hibiscus, Saeng isn’t going to give up and she’ll keep holding on to make it through. Saeng knows it’s hard to adjust to changes to life’s circumstances, but with a little courage and hard work, it will be a breeze. If she believes in herself, she’ll be able to get situated in this new place, showing her resilience.
745	9609	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. That is in there for many reasons. One is because when winter comes and brings all the snow it kills her garden, a space she clearly cherishes. So that's why she wants it to be spring again so she can start growing things again in her garden. She got to take a test on the things that she is growing to make sure it is safe for someone to eat it. That's why I think the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” is significant, because it highlights her determination to resume her gardening and ensure her produce is safe after the harsh winter.
746	9610	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"" (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring. The reason the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it, illustrating her resilience and growing sense of belonging in her new environment."
747	9611	4	3	The Hibiscus is budding means that the flower was growing. That is a flower with lots of bright colors and nothing else can beat it, especially when it is in full bloom. The reason another flower can't beat it is because that flower represents so many things and it is one of the most naturally born flowers around, making it truly unique.
748	9612	4	3	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because that was how he wanted the story to end. He wanted to end the story with her talking to herself, a final, solitary reflection that encapsulated her journey and perhaps hinted at the uncertain path ahead. It was a deliberate choice to leave the reader with her internal monologue, underscoring the intensely personal nature of her experience, and ultimately providing a fitting closure to the narrative.
749	9613	4	3	"People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus"". In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the United States. She has various rememberances of her past home while visiting a plant store. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says ""In the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again"". This shows Saeng’s desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng’s emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here, showing the importance of balancing the old and the new."
750	9614	4	3	Because she was promising herself that when spring comes back, with its milder weather and clearer roads, then she will take the driver's test again, hoping for a better outcome this time around.
751	9615	4	3	"The author concludes with this paragraph to show her determination. When she says, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" Saeng is explaining how the geese have the determination to fly back and that the hibiscus has the determination to bud again, so why shouldn’t she have the determination and confidence to take the test again? The return of the geese and the blooming of the hibiscus represent resilience and the cyclical nature of hope. Saeng said, ""I-I failed the test."" It seems as if failing the driving test made her feel like she was going to fail in the new country. But after she saw the geese’s and hibiscus’s determination through harsh conditions, she was determined to try the test again, drawing strength from the natural world to overcome her own perceived limitations."
752	9616	4	3	The author concludes this story with that paragraph to explain how she already took the test and it is now winter, she will retake the test again when all the flowers and plants come back to life and start again in spring. Saeng wants to take the test again to show her mother that she can pass it, hoping to prove her capabilities. She bought a plant called dorl Faeng-noi for nineteen dollars, a purchase she made to help her mother not be disappointed in her. However, her mother was disappointed that she spent that much money on a plant, revealing a clash in their perspectives on value and priorities.
753	9617	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that when she sees the things from her home and living space, it will comfort her in what she does. The author seems like she needs things from her homeland that help her make the best of things and bring back good memories of earlier life. I think that whenever I want to do a good job it helps to think of the good things that mean a lot to me so I will be happy and want to do good. The author is smart to want to see those things before retaking her test because if she sees her plant doing well and sees the memory of the geese again it will be good luck for her, enabling her to perform her best.
754	9618	4	3	The author chooses to end the story with such a paragraph as this in order to show that Saeng has received a new burst of hope from her memories and the newly familiar things in her new home. The combination of the failed driverís test and being away from her original home caused Saeng to feel much loss. While Saeng is in the flower shop, ìaware of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saengís eyes now swept over her. ìThrough the rest of the story Saeng is shown to still be down, and the reader is left unsure if she will be alright. Then her recovery begins with the presence of familiar things. ìThe pungent small of bitter melon wafted out, and Saengís mouth watered,î, ìThe winter hibiscusí was in the ground nowî, and, ìoverhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faints honks clear and ñ yes ñ Familiar to Saeng now.î This realization that the geese are familiar to her gives way to new realization and a new wave of hope, signifying a turning point in her emotional journey. She recognizes the fact that she is now coming to be familiar with many of the things about her new hone that she had initially thought to be strange. This is what the final paragraph explains to the reader. It summarizes Saengís newfound hope that she will learn to not just live in her new home, but to thrive in it, suggesting a positive outlook for her future and adaptation.
755	9619	4	3	"The auther concludes the story with this statement because it shows that to her the hibiscus symbolizes overcoming obstacles. It symbolizes this because she says""…and the geese return and this is budding, I will take that test again"" (Ho @NUM1). This shows that even though she failed it this time when the hibiscus gets bigger she will retake the test, it shows **hope** or overcoming obstacles. Also I believe that this symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it ""gives her strength from her old country"". This shows that it symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it will help her overcome this test. It will do this by giving her strength or comforting her. From this you can tell that the author ends the story with this statement **to show the hibiscus will help her get through anything**."
756	9620	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it says that Saeng is confident and is willing to go back and take the test. Saeng feels good about herself and wants to do this. This newfound self-assurance, stemming from her experience and realization of her own capabilities, empowers her to face the challenge again, highlighting a journey of growth and resilience. The ending, therefore, emphasizes Saeng's positive transformation and her proactive approach to overcoming obstacles, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism.
757	9621	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was taking a test. In the story there are some quotes to support my response, like, “I-I failed the test,” Saeng said. This suggests she was taking a test. Another reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the story was about spring, gardening, and the life connected to them. The paragraph likely revisits themes of spring and flowers, echoing the story’s central focus on growth and renewal. The daughter and mother depend on plants, growing vegetables and fruits, making the test's outcome particularly relevant to their livelihood and future.
758	9622	4	3	"The last paragraph of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho is important. The last paragraph leaves a definite ending, so the reader knows exactly what is going to happen in the future. This paragraph is a very significant ending to the story because it represents symbols in the story. The author concludes the hibiscus is important to her, signifying a connection to home. Along with the hibiscus, it also shows that the geese and the melting of the snow represent a fresh start and a new beginning. These symbols are important to her in that they give her a chance to start over, and she sees that hope reflected in the winter hibiscus."
759	9623	4	3	Saeng was very distraught knowing that she didn't pass the test, and to her, it felt like a letdown, a significant disappointment. This feeling highlights the ambition and determination Saeng possesses, revealing her strong desire to succeed and pass this particular test, demonstrating her commitment to achieving her goals.
760	9624	4	3	"The author concludes the story with their return to show how Saeng has changed throughout the plot. In the beginning, she refers to her new home as, ""walking into another world."" As a teenager, she had to move from Vietnam, where traditions are so different than in the United States. However, the winter Hibiscus is one plant that provides a connection, resembling those of her previous life. The plant connects her previous life and home to the life and home she lives now. It was hard to adapt to the situation of moving, but the plant created familiar scents and the ""familiar fragrance"" which ""filled her lungs."" It was even difficult for Saeng to say the words ""at home"" without bursting into tears. Once the winter Hibiscus was in the ground, it changed Saeng, and she realized that she needed to appreciate what she had. In conclusion, the author ended the story with that paragraph because it showed how much the plant resembled Saeng and how her mindset on life was altered, demonstrating her growth and acceptance of her new reality."
761	9625	4	3	"I feel that the author concludes the story with this phrase as a way of showing how Saeng is adopting to her new home, yet still valueing her old one. The gist of the sentence is that Saeng will take her test again in the spring, showing her perseverance. However, the sentence also shows how Saeng is coming to know her new land. She says, ""when the snows melt and the geese return,"" this is important because the geese and the snow are of her now home, and she now accepts them. Furthermore, she is looking forward to spring, a new beginning in a new place. However, Saeng also says, ""when this hibiscus is budding,"" and this shows how Saeng is still thinking of her old home, because the plant is her connection to the memories of Vietnam, a tangible piece of her past. Therefore, I feel that the author is showing how Saeng is growing up and living with changes in her life by ending the story with this statement, illustrating her ability to embrace the present while cherishing her roots."
762	9626	4	3	I think that the author is saying to day is that when it is winter the hibiscus is trying to piece the cold. While must plants just die the hibiscus must face it head on, enduring the harsh conditions rather than succumbing as other flora do, and this resilience is what the author seems to highlight.
763	9627	4	3	I think the author includes this because she doesn’t want to leave her audience guessing about what would happen next. Then “I will take the test again.” This quote is saying she might have failed the test with the plant but she is never going to give up and that when spring comes she is going to try again. I feel as though the author added this to give a better understanding of how it feels to leave your homeland to come to a place you don’t know or understand such as the flower situation in the story. When she thought about the plants and how they smelt it gave her the old feelings that she had about her homeland and how close she was with her grandmother. She was so use to plants being free and growing rather than seeing them in pots and not having the room to grow. By seeing all this got Saeng to break down and cry. In conclusion I feel as though the author added the paragraph in the end for understanding and to also let you know that Saeng may be in a new place with a new culture but she will never give up on that test until she feels that she has passed it.
764	9628	4	3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” purposely had that last paragraph in there. Honestly the story is better with it too. In the last paragraph when it says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 @NUM1. When the author writes all those things in nature that will happen it symbolized re-birth and a fresh start, a new chance and that is what Saeng needs with her driver’s license. The author put powerfully those symbols in there to show hope for the girl to make it through her tough time. Finally, the story has a sense of roundness and ends with that last paragraph, the story is complete. The cyclical nature of the seasons mirrors Saeng's own journey, suggesting that even after setbacks, renewal is possible. This carefully crafted ending provides closure and reinforces the theme of resilience, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism about Saeng's future.
765	9629	4	3	"The reason I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph was because it was a good learning story you can learn something from it. The author did that so you can get a better understanding of the story. It said ""ìsaeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the united states of Vietnam."" So from reading that it tells me that its telling you what happened right before the story took place, providing context. So you can get a better understanding of the character's background and motivations. To me its wrapping it all up for you, providing a concise summary and final thought. That's why I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph, to ensure the reader fully grasped the significance of the narrative."
766	9630	4	3	I believe the author of ìwinter Hibiscus ìends the story like she did because Saeng agrees to take the test again. She wants to take the test when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. In other words when spring has come she will be ready for the test. Saeng states in the story ìitís the flowers arenít as pretty, but itís strong enough to make it through the cold months here, thes winte hibiscus. Thatís what matters.î I think Saeng is using this as a guiding light since she just moved from Vietnam. She plans to make it and use the plant as a symbol. She will try again for her drivers license at the start of spring, drawing strength from the resilient winter hibiscus as she adapts to her new environment.
767	9631	4	3	"The author used ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because it's resembling that her mother is refreshing, waking, and restoring its self. And Saeng said she would retake the driving test when that happens. She was really sad she failed. ""I—I failed the test"" She seemed to be embarrassed + sad. So that last paragraph does a good job describing what Saeng is going to do. She is going to look on the bright side of things and restore her self to come back and pass the test, using the imagery of spring as a symbol of her own renewal and determination to succeed."
768	9632	4	3	I, the narrator, value hibiscus because it's a valuable plant, and the garden is your own decision, reflecting your preferences, just like her mother's choice to grow hot peppers. A garden is a way to express different tastes, like the different types of foods you can plant, showcasing the diversity of the plant world, for example, hibiscus, lilies, and other plants.
769	9633	4	3	The author ends the story with that paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. Failing the driver's test was a setback for Saeng, so she plans to take it again. She plans to use the hibiscus as motivation, because the winter for the hibiscus is like overcoming an obstacle, a period of dormancy before renewed growth and blooming. This connection to the hibiscus allows Saeng to view her failure not as a full stop, but as a temporary pause, encouraging her to persevere and try again.
770	9634	4	3	Why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because I think it’s showing how much it actually means to her and shows that she does actually care, despite any previous reluctance or indifference. And by showing that she care's, and acknowledging the importance of the outcome, she will likely take the test again, driven by a newfound sense of purpose.
771	9635	4	3	She ends the story with that paragraph because she wants to let everyone know she feels most comfortable in the spring, when the world feels fresh and new. It also states that she can not wait for the geese to return and the hibiscus to start budding because it is her favorite time of the year, a time filled with hope and the promise of beautiful days ahead.
772	9636	4	3	Saeng is not comfortable in her surroundings and has not adapted to the changes from where she moved. She finds the hibiscus and chooses to buy it because it reminds her of her home in Laos. When she brings it home, her mother seems shocked at first by the price Saeng had paid but is then more sympathetic when she realizes she misses Laos. Saeng says she is going to retake her test in the spring, also implying that she is going to change her attitude about living in America. The hibiscus serves as a catalyst for her to accept her new life while still holding onto her memories of home.
773	9637	4	3	I think the author concludes that in the story because he is saying when the geese are coming back. This cyclical return suggests a sense of hope and renewal, implying a conclusion where life continues despite challenges. The return of the geese provides a tangible marker of time passing and a return to normalcy. This emphasizes the author's conclusive point about enduring cycles.
774	9638	4	3	The author concludes that because she wants to show that Saeng was not giving up. I say this because she moved to a place where she didn't like and knew no one. The author is trying to tell us no matter what don't give up, have faith. At the end, Saeng has faith in herself that she can pass the test next time. She must have realized that just because you're at a place you don't want to, it doesn't mean you can't go on. This reinforces the idea that even in undesirable circumstances, perseverance and self-belief are crucial for overcoming challenges and achieving future success.
775	9639	4	3	The author concludes the story like that to give the reader the idea that you can't just quit if you fail. Despite the setback of not passing, when Saeng said that when spring comes around I will return and take the test again, that shows that she will not quit and life will go on. This resilience in the face of disappointment emphasizes the importance of perseverance. That’s why I think the author chose to conclude the story like that, highlighting Saeng's determination and the cyclical nature of challenges and renewed efforts.
776	9640	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she does not want to give up on fighting her homesickness. The first time she bought that plant, it brought back memories of her old home and it showed how much she missed it there. Now, even though the plant has died, symbolizing a setback, by saying she'll do the test again shows that she doesn't want to let this defeat her in her new home and her new life, demonstrating a continued commitment to adapting and building a future where she is.
777	9641	4	3	The author concludes Saeng's vow in the story to show that Saeng can and does have the ability to overcome obstacles. Saeng feels like she is a failure, especially after failing her driving test. Her hibiscus represents courage to overcome her obstacle, which is her driving test that she failed, and serves as a reminder of her potential. The geese represent survival and the importance of never giving up; they symbolize the need to keep trying your hardest to achieve success, reinforcing Saeng’s resolve to persevere. Through these symbols and her vow, the author emphasizes that Saeng possesses the inner strength to confront her challenges and ultimately triumph.
778	9642	4	3	The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the hibiscus will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receiving a fresh start on things and symbolizing hope for the future. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive; it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. “...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng, understanding that new beginnings are always possible.
779	9643	4	3	The author ends the story with ìWhen they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test againî for many good reasons. Some reasons are that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada, embracing the cyclical nature of life and her own growth. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture, showing a willingness to integrate and learn. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better, seeking closure and acceptance with the passage of time. ìA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saengís eye now swept over her.î She wants to be able to handle the loss better, suggesting a future attempt to reconcile her grief. The author wants to emphasize that the story is not yet over, and her journey of assimilation and healing will continue into the next season.
780	9644	4	3	There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason is the start of the winter, so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, it's the end of the story, so it's a good way to end it because it's the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes the story and it's short and sweet, which makes it a great ending. It's not like most endings to a story, so it's unique, because most stories aren't about nature. It's a fitting conclusion because it leaves the reader with a sense of closure and reflection on the cyclical nature of life, mirroring the hibiscus's seasonal disappearance and return. In conclusion, there are many reasons the narrator could have chosen to end the story with this paragraph.
781	9645	4	3	"The author concludes the story with his paragraph to show how people can regain their determination. In the beginning of the story, Saeng is disheartened after failing her driving test. When she sees the Hibiscus in her mother's garden, she is filled with memories of the past and weeps. Her mother's kindness and gentle words cause Saeng to draw strength from the flower, which, as her mother says, is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" Knowing that the Hibiscus will bud in the spring, Saeng renews her determination to pass the test, understanding that perseverance, like the flower's resilience, can lead to future success."
782	9646	4	3	The author concludes with this response because he suggests Saeng will likely repeat her patterns, but with a shift in focus. She will likely continue her dedicated approach, directing it towards being more helpful not only in the garden but also to her mother’s needs. The implication is that she will also apply herself more diligently to her schoolwork, perhaps finding a better balance with her passion for gardening; thus, she will channel her energy into areas where she can contribute more broadly, leading to a more well-rounded and supportive role within her family and academics.
783	9647	4	3	Saeng's peRsonality in this stoRy shows deteRmination and confident. I think she feels that she could do moRe experienced things on different plants. I also think this is a peRfect hobby experience foR someone who loves Plants. I feel that Saeng @MONTH1 has accomplished heR goals of planting. I think she @MONTH1 wants to puRsue heR career in gaRdenning. When she stated that when the plants come back aRound, she would take the test again, I think she means that she is willing to exploRe more plants. I think she @MONTH1 has got this experience of planting fRom heR motheR. To me this @MONTH1 has been a family tradition. Saeng will pRobably have kids and teach them about different types of floweRs, which shows that she is dedicated to passing down her love and knowledge of plants to future generations.
784	9648	4	3	The author ended the story with that paragraph in order to show that Saeng is looking forward into her life and with a positive outlook. It shows that she is not going to be depressed by the change in her life anymore. The hibiscus is used as a device for this storyís plot. When changes happen with the hibiscus, changes happen in the story. At first, Saeng is without the hibiscus and feels hopeless. When she sees it, she remembers her past and is sad. Once she plants it, things start to look up for her. She begins to accept the change when the last paragraph says, ìwhen they come back... and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test againî it shows that Saeng is looking at her future positively, and with this positive change, the hibiscus is now beginning to bloom. The author concludes the story in a symbolic way that helps express the storyís themes of hope and resilience, ultimately signifying Saeng's embrace of her new reality.
785	9649	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph ìSaeng vowed silently to herselfî because she wants to do things in proper time and season. The previous ìwinter seasonî, the land or soil was so cold that plants were not able to grow properly. The failed attempt to grow the ìHibiscus costs nineteen dollarsî, coupled with the fact that she failed the test, all contribute to her resolve. Seeing ìThere was frail, wiry beauty to her Saeng mother that touched Saeng deeplyî, observing how her mother is shining when she worked with plants, further fuels her determination. These details, all descriptions of past events and feelings, highlight Saeng's desire to make corrections, to learn, and to shine like her mother, and also to pass the test in the future.
786	9650	4	3	"At the end of the short story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng says “when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."" When she says this she is referring to her driver's test. She says she will take the test again because she is reminded that her family didn't give up; they moved to America for a fresh start. The plant she had forgotten drew her back to her childhood world. She sees these flowers after failing, which reminds her that she had never given up before, so she won't now either, demonstrating her renewed determination."
787	9651	4	3	The author is trying to convey a sense of hope for Saeng in her new country. After noting that she failed her test, which is probably a citizenship test, the author wants to conclude the story with something that reasures the reader. It is obvious that this test was important because Saeng could not even look her mother in the eye. This was probably why she bought the flower for her mother. The ending reasures the reader so that you don’t wonder how it will workout for Saeng, offering a sense of optimism that tempers the disappointment of the failed test.
788	9652	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to tell us that she will try and find that flower to bring back memories of her old home, and to show us that it will survive even though it's not from where she wanted it to be from. In the story it says, ""I failed the test,"" meaning Saeng had bought the hibiscus that wasn't real or what she thought wasn't what she wanted it to be. In the last paragraph, she says she will take that test again, implying that she will find a winter hibiscus that is how it used to be in her homeland. She's hoping it survives and hoping she finds a flower like it because in that last paragraph it says, ""Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" meaning she hopes and prays she will find one like the ones from her old homeland, demonstrating her enduring connection to her past."
789	9653	4	3	The Author was trying to end the story quick thats why he ended it with this one. He likely felt pressured by deadlines or perhaps lost inspiration for the complex narrative he initially envisioned, leading him to resolve the plot with uncharacteristic haste. The abrupt conclusion, though unsatisfying, suggests a desire to simply finish the project and move on, sacrificing depth for the sake of completion. Ultimately, this rushed ending leaves the reader with a sense of incompleteness, highlighting the author's need to finalize the story quickly, even if it meant compromising its overall quality.
790	9654	4	3	When spring comes and all the snow melts then she is going to plant new seeds. The author concludes that because she didn’t do good on the test the first time. But next year she is going to work with her plants then take the test again so she can pass it. The author put that in the conclusion because he doesn’t want people to think that she just worries about the plants; it shows she is determined to improve and succeed in all areas of her life, both her passions and her academics.
791	9655	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" is about this girl named Saeng and her mother and grandmother. Flowers are beautiful to them; they plant them all day. Picking them, arranging them. ìSaeng did not dare look her mother in the eye,î feeling a pang of guilt for perhaps not sharing their passion as deeply as they did, a quiet understanding passing between them nonetheless."
792	9656	4	3	The author concludes the story with the saying because it shows that she has confidence in herself. Because she did not pass the test, she could take it again and know she can pass the test. She was upset about it, but her mother, when she talked to her, made her feel good and confident to retake the test, knowing she could pass it. The saying at the end reinforces this newfound belief in her abilities, solidifying the idea that she can overcome challenges with perseverance and a positive attitude. So that's why I think the author concludes it with that saying at the end of the story, emphasizing the character's growth and resilience.
793	9657	4	3	When winter ends and the geese return from the south, signaling the arrival of spring, and when her favorite plant, reminiscent of her homeland, blooms once more, she will attempt again what she had previously tried. This time, however, she will approach the task with a newfound sense of confidence, bolstered perhaps by the passing of time and the lessons learned from her previous experience, allowing her to feel more secure and ready to achieve her goal.
794	9658	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sums everything up and addresses the conflict of her failing her driver's test. When Saeng said, ""I will take that test again,"" it showed her determination to pass and try again. Since the main conflict is resolved, introducing a new one would unnecessarily prolong the story, so the author ends it concisely. The excerpt also subtly connects Saeng's difficulties to those of the geese; just as geese face hardships, so does Saeng in getting her driver's license. And like the geese who persevere, she will return and face the challenge again, demonstrating resilience."
795	9659	4	3	In the story ì Winter Hibiscusî by Minfong Ho the author ends the story in a well mannered carhoined. The author ended with that paragraph to show that Saeng was not going to persuade even though for away from home. She is in a down was spiral at the beginning of the story, she had failed a test and the hibiscus triggered her feeling nostalgic. When she got home her mother greeted her with kinds words, kind of acting as an anti-depressent by making her food with hot peppers and bitter melons. This kind gesture made Saeng see the good in life causing her not to give up and be confident that she will pass the test, highlighting her resilience.
796	9660	4	3	"Well in the story, Saeng fails her driving test. Disheartened, as she is walking home she sees a familiar plant growing near a fence. Intrigued, she then goes to a florist and finds out the plant is called a hibiscus. She then buys the plant with the little money she has because its vibrant color and shape reminds her of her homeland and childhood. It also reminds her of her grandmother who she left behind, a comforting reminder of her, so now she feels connected to the plant. Also, she sees geese fly overhead heading south for the winter, a sign of the changing season, so she says “When they come back,” so she means when the geese fly north for spring. And when “the snow melts,"" so when it becomes warmer and starts spring. When “this hibiscus is budding,” so when spring comes and the plant starts to bloom, a symbol of new beginnings, she will “take that test again,"" so she says she will take the driving test that she failed when spring comes. She gives herself the winter to practice and get ready for the test, using the time to improve her skills and confidence. She vows to herself that come spring, a time of renewal and growth, she will be ready to take the test and this time she will pass, symbolizing her own personal growth and resilience."
797	9661	4	3	She said this to show the determination it takes to make it; no matter how many times you fail, you need to get back up and try again. She displays her courage in this way also, as it takes a lot for someone to fail at something and to get back up and try again on it. Her resolve is evident in her willingness to persevere. She isn't willing to accept failure, and she's trying to redeem her failure, so she says she'll try again. That is why she ended the story that way, demonstrating a commitment to overcoming obstacles and ultimately achieving success.
798	9662	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think the author did this so that people who read the story will know what she is gonna do next spring and they might make out another story in so that you will know that she will take the test in the spring, leaving the reader with a sense of anticipation about her future endeavors. This ending provides closure while simultaneously hinting at a potential continuation of her narrative, centered around the test she will face in the spring.
799	9663	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with that paragraph because when winter hits, the plant she likes will disappear. The flower gave her good luck, so she said, ""When the snow melts in the spring and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The flower was very important to her. She said, ""that rich, sweet scent that was familiar too."" She was talking about the flower's smell compared to her grandmother's shell; it was the same, evoking a sense of comfort and connection that strengthened her resolve to try again in the spring."
800	9664	4	3	The author concludes the story like this because she is going to come back and do the same thing next year, already anticipating the familiar joy and challenge. She knows the rhythms of the place, the subtle shifts in light and color, and the comforting predictability of the task ahead. The ending, therefore, isn't a farewell, but a promise of return, fueled by a deep appreciation for the experience and a quiet determination to repeat it all again.
801	9665	4	3	The author concludes the story with that because she wants to retake the test. She knows she needs to study harder this time. Because she wants to pass the test for her mother, to finally make her proud. So she brought home the flower to apologize to her mother for the disappointment and show her determination to try again.
802	9666	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because everything in the story will repeat, such as the season changes, and you will not be able to plant nor grow in the winter. This cyclical nature mirrors life's challenges and adjustments. For example, she talked about how the plants are nothing like her home, but she has to adapt to the fact sheís not home and adjust to her environment. I say this because if she doesn't, she will just be an unhappy person worrying about where she came from, hindering her ability to thrive in her present circumstances and find contentment. Ultimately, the ending emphasizes acceptance and the need to adapt to life's inevitable changes to find happiness.
803	9667	4	3	The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again, because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and depressed because she wants to go home. She is nostalgic for her past, and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort, like she is home. When she says, “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant, a reminder of her past life, gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring, suggesting a renewed sense of optimism linked to the natural cycle of growth and renewal.
804	9668	4	3	when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself. The memory of her previous attempt stung, but resolve hardened within her. In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again, better prepared and more determined than before.
805	9669	4	3	"In ""Hibiscus"" by Pham Thi Hoai, the author chose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope, and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is one of a depressful mood because Saeng failed her driver's test, so she is very upset. Her memories of her old country start to affect her when she sees the winter hibiscus. ""And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept."" She misses Vietnam very much, and seeing this plant in this store gives her flashbacks. The winter starts to give her the feels; all hope feels lost. ""almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" To her, the strange things are starting to feel the same year by year; no new hope, no new anything, just the same old thing day by day. This plant really starts to tear her apart purely from the representation. ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the word at home, lest she burst into tears again."" She can't say home because home isn't here in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of immense emotions, all having to deal with her past, so the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph, so that's why it fits when it does, providing a sense of closure and suggesting a potential for renewal despite her current struggles."
806	9670	4	3	This was a very interesting story and it snowed all the hardships this young girl has gone through, the author ended it in a very interesting way. When they ended the story I thought to myself how nice it ended. If think the author did a very nice job. She made it so that she snowed all the hard ships that Saeng had gone through, as if they were the harsh winter. Then as the author said, “as the snow melts away,” I think this shows how even though Saeng's problems seem never ending and harsh, that one day they will be gone and things will become beautiful again, like the flower budding in the spring time. Also she did a nice job because throughout the story I could feel her pain. I felt as if I was there with her because of her use of descriptive words like, “exploding, shock, intense” and others to describe how much of a sudden everything was. Then when she ended it, it was like she was showing us Saeng’s hope for a better future, even though things aren’t the way they were back home, offering a sense of closure and optimism for Saeng's journey ahead.
807	9671	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph -ì when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.î because she feels that when the hibiscus blooms she can too bloom by passing the test. Also Saeng is relating herself to the hibiscus. ìItsí flower arnít as pretty, but itís strong enough to make it throu in here, this winter hibiscus.î Her mother is trying to tell her she can be strong also, drawing a parallel between Saeng's resilience and the hibiscus's ability to endure. She too can make it through the cold months. ìlike the geese she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etered against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.î Just like the geese Saeng is realizing to be proud of herself and there will be other chances. Donít always doubt yourself becase they will be other chances. Donít be afraid to try again, as the return of spring and the geese symbolize renewed hope and opportunity.
808	9672	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will go back after winter to take care of it. The author puts this at the ending paragraph because he is telling how much she cares about this plant, indicating she will return to nurture it. She takes care of it because it reminds her of her hometown. So that is the reason she takes such good care of it, so she will have something with her to remind her of home, demonstrating the plant's significance to her.
809	9674	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph about the geese because it shows how Saeng, like the geese, will adapt to her new environment. It shows that she will do what needs to be done in order to survive just like the geese have to do. She will take the test again and will not give up. The paragraph shows how she wants to adapt to the new country. For example, the narration states, ìÖ she noticed the tearstains on her daughterís cheeks and her puffy eyesî. This example shows how Saeng is not used to being in the new country and that she does not like it. However, she will get used to it and do her best to do so, as shown in the closing paragraph. Also, the narration states, ìÖshe admitted to herself, she much preferred it to a Big Macî. This proves how even though she might not like things at times, Saeng is willing to try them to get used to the new country. The narration states, ìÖshe realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become familiar to her now ì. Saeng is getting more and more used to her surrounding and is adopting to them, just like the geese adapt, which is the reason the author ended the story with the paragraph about geese, showing her resilience and determination to thrive in her new home.
810	9675	4	3	The reason why the author wrote the conclusion paragraph was to show that Saeng is looking forward to a brighter future. Saeng is hoping to see the geese once more that remind her of her homeland, a symbol of what she left behind, and that she wants to pass the driving test, representing her desire for independence in this new land. In this story I feel as though Saeng is a very sentimental person, deeply connected to her past and hopeful for her future, and so that is why I think that is reason the author wrote the conclusion paragraph, emphasizing her enduring spirit.
811	9676	4	3	The author concludes this paragraph in this story because it sounds good and to show the people he is writing it to that no matter what happens to you in life you should just keep on doing what you think is best for you, just like the flower; she keeps coming back for more after going through all that's tough, demonstrating resilience and the importance of pursuing one's path despite adversity.
812	9677	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for a reason. The vibrant hibiscus, a splash of color, reminds her of Vietnam and the warmth of her past. The geese, honking overhead in their familiar V formation, remind her of her home now, this new land she has chosen. These two things, the echoes of her past and the reality of her present, make her strong and give her resilience. Therefore, she will take the test when they return, when the hibiscus blooms again and the geese fly north once more. She thinks she can pass the test, draw on the strength of both worlds, when the flower and the geese are vividly present in her life.
813	9678	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is starting to take responsibility for her school work now. For example in the story she made it obvious she cared more about the garden then school, but now she is balancing both. This suggests a growing maturity and a recognition of the importance of her education, demonstrating a positive shift in her priorities and concluding her development.
814	9679	4	3	"Saeng was talking about testing the plants, seeing if the geese liked where she planted them. She wanted to make sure the location was suitable. I know this because she mentioned geese in the last paragraph and in the geese said ""yes"" when she planted the hibiscus, suggesting she was observing their reaction as a way to gauge the plant's success in that spot."
815	9680	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story was mostly talking about the hibiscus. Saeng was saying that when it’s spring and this hibiscus is budding then she will take the test again, hopeful for a better outcome. The hibiscus reminded her of her homeland in the past, and its resilience mirrored her own determination to succeed despite the challenges of a new country, offering her a renewed sense of optimism.
816	9681	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because at the end it's talking of a new beginning. Also, what it's going to be at the new beginning, she says that she is going to take the test again, indicating a sense of hope and determination to overcome the previous setback and move forward. This cyclical return suggests a commitment to self-improvement.
817	9682	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she has a better state of mind after finding a flower that reminds her of home. She is afraid that her parents are going to be mad that she didn't pass the test, therefore she buys the flower she sees for its reminder of home. When she gets home and tells her mom how much she paid for the flower and how she didn’t pass, her mother is upset for only a second, then she is understanding of what her daughter is going through. By the end of the story, she has more confidence that she will succeed next time, demonstrating a renewed sense of hope and determination after connecting with something familiar and receiving her mother’s empathy.
818	9683	4	3	"Minfong Ho ended the story with a phrase of dialogue because it was about the main topic of the story. Saeng was to buy a plant and bring it home, but when she did so, her mother did not approve. The narrative states ""You what?"" Her mother stared at her incredulously""(Ho). When her mother said this, it showed that she was displeased, highlighting the central conflict. The narrative states, ""I-I failed the test""(Ho), further emphasizing Saeng's disappointment. Saeng was not proud to displease her parents in any way. By saying, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again""(Ho), the author is just showing Saeng's love and want to grow for her parents; it shows maturity and determination to reconcile her actions with her parents' expectations, thus concluding the story with a sense of hope and resolve."
819	9684	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to tell the reader that Saeng is going to take the test again. The author wants to tell the reader because she failed the test and now she knows what she did wrong, and she's going to correct it. For example when Saeng said, “then I will take that test again,” Saeng felt sorry she failed a simple test, so she wants to retake the test when the snow melts, showcasing her determination to improve and succeed next time.
820	9685	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the plant wasn't budding and the geese were going away, and then she failed the test because all that made her sad. The gray skies and bare branches mirrored her inner state, making concentration impossible. But when the snow melts, the geese return, their honking filling the air with life, and the plant starts budding, showing tiny signs of green, she will be happy again. The returning vitality of nature will lift her spirits, and she will take the test again, her mind clear and focused, and she will pass because she is happy and hopeful.
821	9686	4	3	The author concludes the story this way for many reasons. One reason is to show Saeng is not going to give up and will keep trying to pass her test, demonstrating her resilience. Another way is to show that even though your life has changed, that doesn't mean that you have to give up on your goals or dreams. These are some of the ways that the author concludes the story, highlighting themes of perseverance and adapting to change.
822	9687	4	3	I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because they wanted to show that she is committed to her nature, especially to the hibiscus. She thought that the hibiscus was special because of what she did with it. Like when they said “she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the centre”. This detail emphasizes her connection to the flower, solidifying the idea that it represents something significant to her. And that’s why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph, using the hibiscus as a final symbol of her enduring spirit.
823	9688	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng feels like that will be the right time to take over her driving test, when the hibiscus is budding and signaling a time of renewal and potential. And another reason would be because the author wants to showcase her unwavering determination, highlighting Saeng's resolve to succeed despite previous setbacks and connect her personal growth to the natural cycle of blossoming.
824	9689	4	3	She vowed this paragraph because she wanted to make her mother proud by passing the test after she had failed it, but she waits for the plant to go through and start budding. The hibiscus bud is like a new start, so if it makes it through winter, she will pass the test. Then Saeng will be able to pass as well, because she knows if a tropical plant was able to survive a harsh winter, then she can survive and pass the test the next spring, proving her resilience and determination.
825	9690	4	3	I think the author concludes the last paragraph in the story because it's kind of like a moral to the story. She's trying to say that when the time is right, she will try it again until she gets it right, showing resilience and determination. Without this last paragraph, you wouldn't be able to fully understand the message of the story, which is about perseverance and the willingness to learn from past experiences. This final thought encapsulates the protagonist's hope and resolve, reinforcing the story's central theme of continuous self-improvement.
826	9691	4	3	Saeng is a very helpful young lady to her mom; she makes things easier. The author made that the ending sentence to make the story more interesting for the reader and to keep them hooked to the end, hinting at Saeng's deeper motivations and the impact of her helpfulness, leaving the audience eager to discover more about her character and the unfolding narrative.
827	9692	4	3	The author concludes the story with that sentence because she wanted to explain to you that she will do this again when the hibiscus is back in season, suggesting a cyclical nature to her actions tied to the blooming of the flower.
828	9693	4	3	I guess she says this because she only wants to take the test when she is comfortable around the flowers, plants, and greens, suggesting her performance might be affected by her environment and she needs a calming, natural setting to feel at ease and perform optimally. Therefore, she believes a familiar and pleasant atmosphere is crucial for her to showcase her best abilities.
829	9694	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it says when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take the test again, showing a cyclical return and a promise of future readiness. This means that when she gets older and gains more experience, and thus more confidence, then she will blossom and get to take the test when she is ready, just like the hibiscus will be ready to start budding again after the winter, signifying a time of renewed growth and potential. This evokes a sense of hope and anticipation for the future.
830	9695	4	3	The Author ends the story off with that paragraph because when dealing with flowers and nature, there are seasons when the flowers don’t come up, like winter for example. The paragraph is saying that in the spring, when the winter is over, she tells herself that she will look forward to seeing all the plants that nature has to give, implying a cycle of hope and renewal after a period of dormancy. This reflects a broader theme of resilience and anticipation for future growth.
831	9696	4	3	I believe he used this as the ending to ensure that she was strong and she would do whatever it took to persevere. He likely wanted to forge her resilience, knowing the road ahead would be fraught with challenges. This difficult conclusion, therefore, wasn't about punishment, but about instilling an unyielding spirit, a vital ingredient for survival and ultimate triumph. He aimed to equip her with the mental fortitude necessary to overcome any obstacle, thus ensuring her future success and demonstrating his faith in her capacity to endure.
832	9697	4	3	The author includes this sentence in the paragraph because it’s the start of a new beginning, signaling a shift in focus and potentially introducing a fresh perspective on the topic at hand. This new beginning could represent a change in the narrative, a different approach to the argument, or even the introduction of new characters or settings, thus setting the stage for further developments. Therefore, this sentence serves as a pivotal point, guiding the reader towards a new direction in the text.
833	9698	4	3	In the story the author concludes with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think she did that to say that you shouldn’t give up. In the story Saeng goes to the store and “touched a petal.” She buys the plant in an attempt to get a reminder of her old home. It seems Saeng is not willing to give up her memories of her past, as she seeks to hold onto them through the hibiscus. When she brings home the plant and her mom helps her plant it in the garden, I think Saeng is trying to make her new home like her old. In this way, Saeng is working to create a sense of continuity and connection to her past, rather than forgetting it.
834	9699	4	3	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with Saeng vowing to take the test in the spring when the geese return, the snow melts, and the hibiscus is budding. This is done to symbolize the many things that Saeng learnt. For example, she learnt she has to adjust to changes in her life and becoming familiar to the new things. The geese and snow she admits are the things that were “strange before [and] had become familiar to her now.” The hibiscus also represents something and has a reason for being included in the last paragraph. It represents the ability to overcome obstacles, connection to the past, and comfort when needed, reminding her perhaps of her grandmother's strength. The last paragraph symbolizes many things, and if you look into it deeply, you will learn what Saeng learnt, which is the embrace of both the new and the old.
835	9700	4	3	The author ends the story with Saeng vowing to herself about the relationship between passing and driving test and the significance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is linked to the way things used to be for her in Vietnam; for example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was ìMadagascar periwinkleî in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower adapts to its surrounding when taken from a different country in accordance to Saeng adjusting to life in @LOCATION3. The reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again symbolizes that connection of the flower to the way she lives now, reflecting her resilience. For instance, her ability and determination that when that flower buds she will overcome obstacles, like passing the driving test. Another is a connection of her past experiences, a comforting reminder of home. And it was a sense of comforting to her after she failed her driving test, offering solace and renewed motivation. The author linked the flowerís significance to the ending of the story showing the hope and dedication within Saeng, highlighting her determination to overcome the obstacles she faces to get where she is today.
836	9701	4	3	"The reason why I believe the author concluded the story like that, is because she is always going to start over. For instance, in the story she said ""I failed the test."" From that moment, she thought she was going to give up. So, the ending emphasizes her resilience; even with setbacks, she embraces new beginnings, showing that failure doesn't define her journey, but rather fuels her continuous efforts to improve and move forward. That is why I believe she ended the story with that line."
837	9702	4	3	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because the author is trying to say that Saeng is going to start all over again just like the hibiscus would, blooming anew. Even though you go through bad times in your life, just step up and do it over again until it becomes better, finding renewed strength. The author also concluded the story with that paragraph because the paragraph pretty much starts the story all over again, suggesting that like Saeng was going to do, life offers cycles of renewal and opportunity.
838	9703	4	3	She means that when she returns, she's planning to repeat the same task or process. She wants to give it another shot, essentially, and see if she can achieve a better outcome this time around. This implies a desire for improvement and a belief that with another attempt, she might perform better.
839	9704	4	3	"Saeng vowed silently to herself, ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" because her mind went off track from thinking about a flower. She noticed, ""One of the blossoms had fallen off,"" then carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. It happily distracted her mind. Her promise regarding the test was silenced for a long moment, and she didn't say anything. Her mother never got mad. All she did was brush the fragments of green off Saeng's hands. Her mother was mainly thinking about the plants as the day went on. Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the 'winter hibiscus' into it. Seeing her mother caused a reaction of ideas, so she tried to etch an image of geese. She felt she could even send a goat to retake the driving test, as she was getting used to her new surroundings. The intro states, ""Saeng, a teenage girl, has moved to the United States from Vietnam,"" and this move, along with the hibiscus, was clearly weighing on her mind."
840	9705	4	3	The author included this paragraph to show how much the girl missed Vietnam. When the girl saw the hibiscus it brought back memories of Vietnam. Seeing the hibiscus allows her to find comfort. So the paragraph is there to show, in part, how the United States is different from Vietnam. Since the United States has changing seasons it allows the girl to get use to the United States. The plant will always be there, a reminder of her past, but she has to look for the good that United States provides. The author states, ìAlmost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.î This quote shows how the girl was getting use to the United States. How she will always remember Vietnam, and finds things in the United States that remind her of Vietnam, helping her bridge the gap between her past and present. In conclusion, the paragraph is used to show how much the girl missed Vietnam, but how she finds comfort within the United States, suggesting a gradual process of adaptation and acceptance.
841	9706	4	3	These basically say that he will be around again just like the geese always come back, returning with the seasons in their familiar V-formation, a constant presence in the cyclical rhythm of nature. This imagery suggests a predictable and inevitable return, much like the unchanging patterns of the natural world. Thus, the assurance of his eventual reappearance echoes the reliability of the migrating geese.
842	9707	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. One being that she is still uncomfortable about talking about her old home; she was still yet to say the words ""at home."" The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding all remind her of her home. We know this because Saeng says, ""Just as she known it would feel..."" Back home, it would ""grow wild just at from the cracks in the brick walls or between tiled roofs."" So, with reminders of her home, she is given both comfort and confidence. The author therefore concluded with this paragraph because since the geese, hibiscus, and the snow melting remind her of her home, that is when she will take the test again, when she is confident and strong enough to face the challenges ahead."
843	9708	4	3	By adding this paragraph to the end of the story, it shows that a resolution was made and that the theme of overcoming obstacles is present in the story. When Saeng failed the test, she was miserable and heartbroken however, after buying the hibiscus, she had found hope and motivation and decides, in the end, that she will take the test again, ìin the spring, when the snow melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddingî. This hope at the end of the story helps put the reader at ease when they wonder what might happen next, and it helps move the story to a conclusion. This is why most endings are meaningful like this; readers are able to obtain the message as the story ends through paragraphs like this. In this case, the authorís message was to never give up and that people find motivation in simple things, showing that even in defeat, renewal is possible. It is important to know what an author is trying to tell the reader through paragraphs as not only a reader trying to understand the purpose of a story, but also as a writer trying to express their ideas clearly to an audience, making the narrative resonate more deeply.
844	9709	4	3	I think that the author uses this quote, ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is buding, then I will take the test  again.î It symbolizes that spring brings new life and hope. ìBut where was the home thought come? The hibiscus hedge? The way her gentle grandmother?î ìBOAT RIDE into the night and it was gone.î from Vietnam to a foreign land. One night she had so much hope, like, abundance, then the next she is in foreign land that is nothing like her old home. The flowers bloom in the spring bringing new life, and she associates that with taking the test again. There is a chance to move on; there is hope. There is hope that spring will come, flowers will come, birds will come. It is a chance to let go of the old and embrace the new. The ending quote was said to bring hope and like to her and she sort of promises to herself that it will get better. Hope is what makes every obstacle easier to get over and everything bearable, suggesting that Saeng's internal promise is a critical tool for navigating her new, unfamiliar world.
845	9710	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that the hibiscus is a symbol for Saeng. In the springtime the hibiscus grows just like Saeng. When Saeng got to the new place she was small and puny just like the plant. ""Its leaves quavering in the wind"" (@NUM1). This quote tells us that the plant was weak and puny. If the plant was strong it would not be quivering. The fact that Saeng broke down and bought the plant tells us she was not strong. And at the end the author uses that paragraph to tell the reader that the hibiscus is strong and so is Saeng and they can overcome anything, demonstrating their shared resilience and ability to flourish despite initial hardships."
846	9711	4	3	The author concludes the story this way to show Saeng does not give up and is determined to pass the test. The narration says ìNot like the kind we had @NUM1]. Saeng feels very strongly about her old home and wants hibiscus just like she and her grandmother used to have. Because Saeng would not bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is sad and determined to get another one. The text also states, ìÖ and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @NUM2]. This also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again, demonstrating her resilience. She misses her home and wants hibiscus just like she had at her old home, revealing her deep connection to her past and fueling her resolve to succeed. Therefore, Saeng's actions highlight her unwavering spirit and commitment to achieving her goals despite setbacks.
847	9712	4	3	In this story the reason that the author concludes things this way is to pick a tone that feels comfortable to test again. The person who will take the test again may have picked the tone with relation to her past, perhaps drawn from repeated encouragement, which she takes the time to prepare herself, and maybe that is something her parents or grandparents taught her, instilling a sense of resilience and calm under pressure. This comfortable tone ultimately helps her approach the test with a renewed sense of confidence.
848	9713	4	3	"The author concluded this because she thinks this is the right time to retake the test. She adds this because the snow is melted, the hibiscus is budding, and the geese's return is a perfect time because everything is back and warm. She believes this signifies a period of renewal and growth, mirroring her own readiness. She says ""when they come back...then I will take the test again"" means she will have all the confidence to take the test, drawing strength from the positive changes around her. Saeng vowed to take it again, and she will; she thinks this time she will pass, fueled by the optimism of the season. That's what the author concludes this to the story, suggesting a hopeful outlook and a belief in the power of timing and perseverance."
849	9714	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope and the meaning of the hibiscus to Saeng. The author also ends the story like that because spring is a time for new beginnings and where everything comes back to life and starts to regrow, so to say that when the snow melts and geese return, it's saying it's the right time for a second chance. ""It failed the test,"" Saeng said. She tore off a leaf, shredding it to pieces; that shows the dying of the hope she had, or the hibiscus symbolized it. So that’s why the author ended it like that because it shows new beginnings, suggesting that even in failure, there is the potential for growth and renewal, offering a sense of optimism despite the immediate disappointment."
850	9715	4	3	The author concludes the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with the strong, one-sentence paragraph stating that Saeng will take the test when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. This sentence leaves the reader in suspense while incorporating the main point of the story and combining them to express an idea about what might happen in a continuation of the future of Saeng and this story. After all, the reason Saeng had bought the hibiscus was to comfort her mother and herself during a difficult time. While she stood watching the geese, the author chose this moment to express Saeng’s feelings of determination to stay strong and take the test. In the end, the author concluded the story with a striking sentence which not only summarized the story's key themes but also left a cliffhanger, suggesting hope and renewal for Saeng's future endeavors.
851	9716	4	3	ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself ,in the spring ,when snows melt and geese return and  this hibiscus is budding ,then I will take the test againî. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it makes you think about the story after you're done reading it. Saeng's determination, tied to the natural cycle of renewal, leaves us contemplating her future and the cyclical nature of hope, challenge, and perseverance. This cyclical structure highlights the enduring human spirit, suggesting that setbacks are not final but rather opportunities for renewed effort, symbolized by the return of spring and the blooming hibiscus.
852	9717	4	3	In many stories the narrator uses a dramatic yet conclusive statement to end the story. An example of one such occurrence is in the short story ìWinter Hibiscusî. In the story the young girl finishes off by telling us when she will be taking her test again, although not directly to us as it says ìSaeng vowed silently to herselfî but it still informs the reader. The reason the author includes this last ìvowî is to inform not only the reader of the future but to show the girl's determination and spiritual connection with the plant, particularly its resilience mirroring her own. For example, when it says ìand this hibiscus is buddingî it’s showing the girl's connection with the plant because of the comfort and confidence it has given her, especially since she needs to take the test and succeed. In conclusion, the narrator concluded the story with the paragraph to show future events and to illustrate the spiritual connection the girl had with the flower and the homeland, solidifying the themes of perseverance and hope.
853	9718	4	3	In the story, at the end of the last paragraph the author wrote that “why they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (last paragraph). The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to mention that Saeng is a student and she had failed a test. Even though Saeng is so interested in flowers, particularly the hibiscus, she also cares about her school too. When the snows melt Saeng will take the test, connecting her academic life with the natural world she so admires, just like the hibiscus is budding and starting to blossom. This shows her commitment to both her passions and her responsibilities.
854	9719	4	3	"After they come Saeng was silently to herself, ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is Saeng, then I am take that test again."" She says this sentence as she is herself back to home. She thinks it familiar to what Saeng was. She is herself how quietly she vowed to this so every season. Her live is very quiet and heavy. She feels as of place. Due to failing her driving test things herself was thing for her to United State was so different from Vietnam and she expresses her feelings will she talk a about this something flower, a flower that perhaps reminds her of home, a vibrant splash of color in a landscape that feels so foreign, connecting her past vows to her present struggles."
855	9720	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to remind the reader and summarize the story. The way she summarizes is by mirroring the beginning, where Saeng failed the test, with the ending, where Saeng plants the hibiscus in winter. The author wants to remind the reader about the journey of the whole story, highlighting the transformation and perhaps the cyclical nature of hope and perseverance.
856	9721	4	3	He concludes this story like that so you dont feel as if she was defeated. She is now more aware or believes she can complete the task. Also she has more selfconcious in herself because of the flower and now it reminds her of her home, giving her a renewed sense of purpose and determination as she faces future challenges.
857	9722	4	3	The author concluded the story with this because just like the flower it will come back anew, and so will she. The flower represents determination, using the flower to show her own determination. Even though she failed her driver's test, she still has determination to take it and try to pass again, viewing the flower as a symbol of resilience. Even with failure, she is determined to get over it. Just like the flower losing its buds in the winter and growing them back, Saeng is forgetting her failure and coming back anew, ready to face the challenge again with renewed hope.
858	9723	4	3	"The author uses this paragraph as a symbol of realization and a new beginning for Saeng. She spent so much time missing the past that she didn’t know how to enjoy the present, which theme-wise the author is saying “live in the moment.” The hibiscus represents strength, as her mother said, ""It's strong enough to make it through the winter months,... that’s what matters."" Symbolically, the hibiscus flowering even after hardship shows the potential for joy after sorrow. Ultimately, the author is saying that tough times are inevitable, so hold on to the moments that make you smile, for they will help you persevere through the times that are tough. In essence, the flower embodies resilience and the importance of cherishing present joys to weather future storms."
859	9724	4	3	In the story ìWinter Hibiscusî by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to foreshadow the future for Saeng. It seems like the author is trying to say Saeng will be taking time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before she takes the test again, now that she better understands the culture and expectations. It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has once failed, revealing her resilient spirit. The perserverance in Saeng shows and will help her overcome many things in her new country. In the text when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole she says ìlet me help mother.î This shows her love towards her mother and her care for the plant that represents her pastime, further emphasizing their bond and shared hope. So in the end of the story adding the vow was a good way to show Saengís commitment to her future success, suggesting a promising path ahead despite initial setbacks.
860	9725	4	3	The author puts that excerpt into the text to show the reader that she had made a mistake and will fix it in the future. I believe the author put it in for that reason because in the text Saeng began to cry when she admitted to her mother that she failed the test, highlighting her disappointment. This shows that she was really upset by the fact she failed and hopes to improve in the near future, suggesting a determination to overcome this setback. Another reason why I believe the author concludes the story like this is to lead the reader on to believe Saeng is going to get over being homesick, implying a future where she adapts and thrives despite her initial struggles.
861	9726	4	3	The author ends the story “Winter Hibiscus” with the passage “When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She is saying how she is going to try to take the test again because of the fact that she failed the first time. I think the hibiscus she bought comforted her and made her think of her homeland, with its vibrant life and promise of renewal, so she thought when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. The plant made her think positively. And instead of thinking she will fail she is thinking she will pass the next time. I also think Saeng felt comfort in nurturing the plant when she was upset, and I think that helped her feel a lot better; tending to the hibiscus provided a sense of purpose and a tangible reminder of home, allowing her to approach her future studies with renewed hope.
862	9727	4	3	The author concludes the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with that paragraph as a sign of reassurance. Saeng had had a tough few years adapting to the United States from Vietnam, and this paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge just like a bump in the road. Saeng had just had a rough day after failing her driver’s test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse she says, “That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?” Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time of transition. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay, suggesting resilience. The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The winter is a hardship for the geese in that they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is a time Saeng will be away from Vietnam in spirit. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome it, so will she. This last paragraph is a good, positive, and hopeful ending to this touching story, so the reader knows to have hope in life, even amidst difficulties.
863	9728	4	3	There is why the author ended the story with this paragraph. It means that when she comes back after winter she will repeat her tasks all over. For example, she will dig, sow flowers, and serve their customers. Then when winter comes again, she will do it all over. So essentially the author is using different words to say when winter ends she will repeat her actions. That is why the author ended the story with that paragraph, emphasizing the cyclical nature of her work and life.
864	9729	4	3	"The author brought out the paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", to portray the theme of hope and perseverance in the story. Saeng used the hibiscus, a symbol of resilience and beauty, for hope in her life, connecting her personal aspirations to the natural cycle of renewal. The author also uses the choice of words or diction, such as ""spring,"" ""snows melt,"" and ""budding,"" to explain the way Saeng lived her life depending on a flower and the changing seasons, highlighting her patient anticipation. The paragraph also subtly explains the way her culture, with its deep connection to nature and the rhythm of the seasons, is depending on the theme of the story, where personal milestones are intertwined with natural events, emphasizing the cyclical nature of life and the enduring power of hope."
865	9730	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the plant brings back memories to Saeng, and she is sort of like the plant. Saeng can be compared to the plant by how she is starting out in a new area that she is unfamiliar with, as is the plant. The plant is now being planted in the soil outside her house and has to grow. Saeng has to learn to grow as well and get better and prepare to take the test again, embracing her new life. So, when the plant is grown and adapted, Saeng believes she will be grown and adapted too. In conclusion, this paragraph is a perfect ending for the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho because it symbolizes Saeng's hope for the future and her ability to adapt and thrive in a new environment."
866	9731	4	3	I think that the author ends this story with that paragraph to sum up what the story was all about and to also suggest that Saeng would try the test again. In the story it says she realised that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now, and this last paragraph helps bring all this together, showing her growing comfort and perhaps hinting at a future attempt, fueled by her increased understanding.
867	9732	4	3	A vow is a good ending; she vowed to take the test again because she failed it. It expresses how she feels, and she made a commitment to pass. The author wanted to show a lot of feeling and how desperate she was, showcasing her determination. So she saw tons of beauty to keep her going, fueling her resolve and reinforcing her pledge. This act of finding beauty highlights her strength and dedication.
868	9733	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, ""When they come back,"" Saeng vowed silently to herself, ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She buys the flower because she failed the driver's test, a disappointment she feels deeply. She has seen the familiar plant on her way home as she went to a florist shop to try and buy one, its vibrant color catching her eye and stirring a sense of comfort within her. The flower makes her happy and reminds her of home, a connection to her roots in this new place. The author ends the story the way he does because it leaves hope, so that the story doesn't end sad, emphasizing the cyclical nature of life and second chances. She still has hope of passing the driver's test, symbolized by the recurring seasons and the promise of the hibiscus's bloom, suggesting a renewed determination and a brighter future."
869	9734	4	3	She failed the test the same day she got the plant and saw the geese fly over. The plant and the geese represent symbols to her: the plant represents her home, where she used to live, and the geese represent how they are moving on in life, overcoming the obstacles of cold weather and snow to move on to something better, most likely a warmer climate. All of this is a symbol of a new beginning for her, signaling a fresh start. So, she wanted to take it again around the time of a new beginning – when the geese fly over again and the plant grows, as these coinciding events will provide her with a sense of reassurance. She feels that since she failed, she should start over, aligning her efforts with nature's cycle of renewal to enhance her chance of success.
870	9735	4	3	The author added the story in with this paragraph for a lot reasons, including to make the story longer, and also to show that even if you screw up the first time you can still try again. The inclusion serves to build suspense and provide a richer, more detailed narrative for the reader. By showcasing a character's initial failure, the author emphasizes the importance of perseverance and highlights the possibility of redemption through renewed effort. Ultimately, the story underscores the idea that setbacks are not necessarily permanent and that success can be achieved through repeated attempts.
871	9736	4	3	In the story ìWinter Hibiscus,î the author includes this paragraph, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again, to emphasize that Saeng is willing try plant again in spring. Saeng wants to try planting again in the spring time to prove that she is trying to adapt to the new settings and to prove that she cares about the planting, demonstrating her resilience and determination to succeed in this unfamiliar environment. This renewed attempt signifies her commitment to not giving up, even after facing initial setbacks. Thus, Saeng's desire to replant represents a larger effort to adjust and thrive.
872	9737	4	3	Saeng ment that she will take that test next spring and pass it with the hope of her winter flower and the sight of her flock of geese; she has high hopes that she will pass her test. When she sees buds on her hibiscus then she will take the test again. Saeng was very upset when she failed it the first time and she was hoping she passed next spring, renewing her determination to succeed.
873	9738	4	3	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a paragraph explaining when the character, Saeng will take her driving test again. She says she will ""when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" I think the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng has new-found hope. For example, since she has moved from Vietnam, she has been very homesick. ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words 'at home,' lest she burst into tears again."" But when she finds a hibiscus plant, it reminds her of her homeland. ""Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs."" Saeng even buys the hibiscus to plant in her garden in her new home. This act of planting signifies her willingness to put down roots in a new place. By having the hibiscus plant with her, it gave her memories of her old life and strength to continue with her new one. The plant gives her strength to try for her driving test again, symbolizing her renewed determination to navigate her new life. By concluding with that paragraph, it shows Saeng's change in emotions from depressed to hopeful and it also shows the strength that the hibiscus plant gives her, suggesting a brighter future as she adapts to her new environment."
874	9739	4	3	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, ìItís flowers arenít pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months ???, this winter hibiscus. ìIt shows that the mother wants Saeng to learn that Saeng should be strong even in times of difficulty. Another example is when the narrator says, ìshe realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, through the quiet repetition of season upon seasonÖî It shows that Saeng realized that the new place that sheís leaving right now is almost the same as their old home. This understanding helps her overcome her initial apprehension about the unknown. In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that Saeng should face the new reality of the world, embrace the changes it brings, be strong and follow the flow of life, knowing she carries within her the resilience to adapt and thrive.
875	9740	4	3	ìIn the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibisus is budding, then I will take that test againî Saeng thinks to herself. Saeng finds herself in a new place where she has no friends. She finds comfort in a plant shop one day when she comes apon a Hibiscus flower. The flower calms her spierit and helps her beguin to adjust to the changes in her life at this time. The vibrant colors and delicate petals offered a sense of peace amid her unfamiliar surroundings, reminding her of the cyclical nature of life and the promise of renewal.
876	9741	4	3	The author concluded with the paragraph about when winter turns to spring, she will take her driving test again for one main reason. The girl says this because just like the plant coming back to life and starting over, she will start over too. In the essay Saeng, the young girl says, ìWhen they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.î Saeng failed the test the first time, and she is going to wait until spring so that she can have a fresh start, filled with renewed hope. In the essay, the ìwinter hibiscusî reminds Saeng of her grandmother and her home in Laos. This at first makes her sad but then realizes how wonderful her memories are and helps her to get through this tough time. Her memories are going to give her strength to carry on with her life and try her driverís test again in the spring, approaching it with a positive outlook.
877	9742	4	3	The author ends it with that paragraph because the girl is talking about when the @DATE1 or spring comes again, she will try again. The author ends it with that because it explains how the girl feels about spring and the animals, highlighting her hope for a new beginning. The girl says a lot about the geese in the story, so we know from that she likes animals, and the return of spring symbolizes a renewed opportunity for connection with them.
878	9743	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it sums up how the memories and the plant affect her. Just like the plant Saeng grows better in her own country and likes it better there but she can still survive in a new place if it is taken care of and fights to stay beautiful, the plant becomes a symbol of Saeng's own resilience. The ending shows that Saeng realizes that if she tries harder she can survive like the plant, so she is going to take the test again. Her mother says, “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” Her mother is trying to tell the daughter it's ok and she can get through the hard times, even if it means adapting and finding strength in new ways. In the end, Saeng knows she can overcome challenges and thrive, just like the plant.
879	9744	4	3	"In the winter Hibiscus, the author chose to end the story with a hopeful paragraph which stated, ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The reason for the decision to end on an optimistic note are as follows. For example, the Hibiscus represents the ideas of resilience when faced with challenge, and the determination to adapt and succeed. Saeng’s situation is similar to the flower’s, which has been uprooted from its original spot, replanted, and forced to try and survive the Winter. Saeng has moved from her beloved homeland; she must begin life anew in another country, and has been faced with the obstacle of failure in regards to an unnamed test. In the final paragraph, she finds that like the cherished hibiscus flower, she must be resilient and determined to succeed in her new home, suggesting that she, too, will blossom again in time. Therefore, the optimistic ending underscores the theme of hope and perseverance."
880	9745	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph (when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again) because it explains what she is going to do when winter is over, providing a sense of closure and a glimpse into her future determination. Also to keep the readers guessing on what’s going to happen, to Saeng and her mother, leaving them anticipating the outcome of her renewed efforts. Another reason is to have a new story when winter is over, hinting at potential developments and challenges that Saeng might face in her pursuit. This ending offers a hopeful note while maintaining suspense, suggesting further narratives centered around Saeng's perseverance.
881	9746	4	3	"I know the reason why the author concludes the story the way he does, and it is a good reason. It says that since she failed this year, next year when it is time to ready up the garden, she will try again. That is a good moral because you have to keep trying and trying to succeed because even if you fail, you are not losing any progress. It is like what @PERSON1 had happen to him; even though it took him @DATE1 tries to successfully make the light bulb, he simply said, ""I just found out @NUM1 ways not to make a light bulb."" So I do agree with this author and how he ended the story, as it emphasizes perseverance and the value of learning from setbacks."
882	9747	4	3	She does this to show her struggle with her gardening. It is like this because each year she has to work on her garden because the winter blows it away, meaning it kills it. This yearly cycle of creation and destruction highlights the frustrating and repetitive nature of her gardening efforts, emphasizing the uphill battle she faces each spring to rebuild what was lost, ultimately underscoring the depth of her gardening struggle.
883	9748	4	3	The author ending the story with that paragraph because it shows how Saeng wont give up. Saeng wants to make her mother proud so she is gonna try to do whatever it takes, pouring all her effort into future endeavors. All Saeng trys to do is make her mother happy. When she failed, her mother was disappointed, a feeling Saeng desperately wanted to avoid. Then suprisingly understanding. When Saeng told her mother she failed Saeng started to cry, overwhelmed by the setback, but then her mother wiped the tears away, offering comfort and unspoken encouragement. This moment of connection reinforces Saeng's resolve, suggesting she will persevere in her efforts to earn her mother's pride and affection.
884	9749	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it means that when the shovel grows again in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, she will take the test again. So, she will wait until the next spring to take the test, signifying a period of patience and renewed hope tied to the natural cycle of rebirth.
885	9750	4	3	In the story the test was if she could overcome her homesickness. When she went to the greenhouse all of the plants and flowers brought back memories of her homeland. When she saw the flower it reminded her of the times she would get water from the well and a flower was floating in it. So after the winter she would go back to the place and see if she was still homesick. I feel she ended it that way because it shows that she will persevere and not give up and try again, demonstrating a commitment to facing her challenges directly. This cyclical return suggests a determined effort to adapt and ultimately conquer her longing for home.
886	9751	4	3	I think the author adds the last paragraph because the story could use a little part about Saeng and what she is planning to do next. Also the author might have added that paragraph because she was perhaps thinking about writing a second story of Winter Hibiscus, and they wanted to write a part that could be a potential lead-in. It would make you wonder if she does take the test again whether she would pass it this time after the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. I think this might be why the author added this paragraph in the story, to offer a glimpse into Saeng's future and leave the reader contemplating her potential success.
887	9752	4	3	I think the author concluded the Story with these lines because Saeng feels more confident. First, when Saeng first saw the hibiscus, she was sad, but after seeing the flower, she got happy and hopeful about the future. Next, her mother helps her plant it, providing support and encouragement, and Saeng is sure it'll be there in spring. Finally, Saeng feels better since she has reflected on her past and now looks forward to new beginnings.
888	9753	4	3	I think Minfong Ho concluded her story ìWinter Hibiscusî the way she did to show the avid determination of Saeng, the main character. She failed the test but she got the hibiscus and it helped her to restore her resolve to pass the test. Now that she had a moment of her homeland and her family there she was most likely reminded that they wouldíve wanted her to succeed, and so she promises herself that she will take that test again when the hibiscus plant starts budding. This promise, fueled by the hibiscus, symbolizes her renewed connection to her roots and a firm commitment to her goals, highlighting the enduring power of determination. This is why I feel that ìWinter Hibiscusî was concluded in this way.
889	9754	4	3	At the end of the essay ìWinter Hibiscusî by Ho, it ends in a positive manner. ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î The reason why I think that the author decided to put that there, was to show how Saeng felt about her country. So when the country that she is in has spring again, she will take that test because that country reminds her of her original country in the spring, giving her hope. This connection to nature and the promise of renewal allows her to feel more at home and confident, enabling her to face the challenge of the test once more. That's why the author put that sentence at the end of the essay.
890	9755	4	3	Saeng promises herself that “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test agan.” The hibiscus is metaphorical to Saeng for her childhood. Evidently she grew up in Vietnam and moved to the @LOCATION2, perhaps somewhere much colder. She misses her homeland, and all the flowers remind her of Vietnam's lush landscapes. She is overwhelmed by all the memories that she breaks down and cries. Change is a difficult thing to overcome or adjust to, especially moving to a foreign country with different customs and weather. She has to cope with it though, and by planting the winter hibiscus is a way of coping with this homesickness and new environment. She knows that she will eventually adjust to the major change for she realized, “that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become… almost familiar to her now.” She promises herself that she will retake the drivers test when the hibiscus blossoms because like Saeng a flower changes also. When the hibiscus finally overcomes the cold, dreary winter months and blooms, Saeng will know she is ready to take the test again for that flower can also symbolize her going through changes. The geese in the story also symbolize changes, they have to migrate south in the winter to avoid the cold but return home when its warm enough. Like Saeng, she will avoid the test in the winter but in the spring when she feels comfortable; this demonstrates her growing resilience and adaptation to her new life.
891	9756	4	3	So, she's saying she will take the test next year, giving her ample time to prepare thoroughly and address any areas where she feels less confident. This extended preparation window should allow for focused study and a potentially better outcome.
892	9757	4	3	The author concludes the story of the end because I think the author concludes the end of the story because he wants to kind of say I will be ready next year to sprout again. He will be ready to test him to not cry and break down when he sees the plant, to think of childhood memories; he will be ready to face the cycle of life and death, understanding that even in endings, there's the promise of renewal and growth, offering a sense of hope and acceptance.
893	9758	4	3	Saeng buys a winter hibiscus to plant in the garden and to remind her of her homeland. She has failed some sort of test and is upset over it. Her mother feels bad for Saeng, so she doesn’t get upset that the hibiscus cost @MONEY1. After planting the hibiscus, Saeng says to herself, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” The author uses this paragraph to make you think about whether or not Saeng will fail or pass the test again. It also makes you wonder about what kind of test since the author says “hibiscus is budding” and “the geese return.” It must be a test that you can only take once a year, because she says that “In the spring” she will take the test again, leaving the reader hopeful for Saeng’s success in the future.
894	9759	4	3	The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is trying to tell the reader a message. The author is trying to say that if a plant can make it through the cold winter, then she can pass her driver's test. This idea likely connects to the character's resilience and inner strength, suggesting that overcoming challenges, like the winter for the plant, mirrors her ability to conquer her anxieties about driving. That is why I think the author included that paragraph, using the plant as a symbol of hope and perseverance for the character.
895	9760	4	3	The author concludes the story ìWinter Hibiscusî with ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î The author ends with this promise or commitment because it shows hope and determination. Saeng vowing to herself ìI will take that test again,î shows her determination and unwillingness to let the previous failure define her. That is enough to bring hope to someone who has failed and wants another chance. This paragraph also sums up and displays Saengís good character. It shows Saengís strength because even though she failed the first time she was going to put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed. To fail and try again shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because ìwhen the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.î brings everything back full circle, connecting her personal struggle to the cyclical nature of life and renewal. It holds the promise of Spring and better things to come with it, suggesting that just as nature revives, so too will Saeng's opportunity arise again. There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with îwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,î reinforcing the themes of resilience, perseverance, and the enduring power of hope in the face of adversity.
896	9761	4	3	"The author added it in at the end not only to make the story have a happy, hopeful ending, but to show the reader that Saeng slowly adjusted to the changes in life. The paragraph above explains that Saeng realized that ""the many things that seemed strange before had become,... almost farmiliar to her now."" So the author lastly concludes that eventhough she failed the test this time, just as the geese will return in the spring, then she can take the test again. She gets the point of the story across and it’s a ""cheerful"" way to end it, reinforcing the theme of resilience and adaptation in the face of challenges, offering a sense of closure and optimism for Saeng's future."
897	9762	4	3	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with, ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."", to show that the hibiscus plant has given Saeng hope. It has helped her get through some rough and difficult times. In the story Saeng has just failed her @CAPS1 test and had to walk home in the cold. She was very upset and discouraged by this setback. On her way home Saeng saw a familiar flower, a vibrant splash of color amidst the gray landscape. She had walked into a flower store to see if they sold the hibiscus that she had seen, drawn to it like a moth to a flame. The employee pointed her towards the flower, its presence a comforting beacon. The hibiscus brought back many cherished memories of her hometown in Vietnam, a connection to her past and a reminder of her strength. Saeng planted her flowers in the vegetable garden, a symbol of resilience and new beginnings. That flower had given her hope, a renewed sense of purpose and determination. She is ready to try the @CAPS1 test again, armed with the hibiscus's silent promise of spring and a fresh start."
898	9763	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the season is over. For example it is starting in the winter; the hibiscuses are dying, mirroring a sense of ending and dormancy. Also, she is leaving and won't come back till she can plant flowers again in the spring, suggesting a period of waiting and anticipation for renewal. Symbolically, she will come back again when she takes the test over again. In conclusion, that is why the author ends the story with this paragraph, highlighting a cyclical pattern of endings and beginnings tied to the seasons and personal challenges.
899	9764	4	3	The reason the author of ìWinter Hibiscusî ends the story with the last paragraph is to give hope to the end. It gives a certain lift of joy at the end of a moderately depressing story, especially considering the cultural clashes and the mother's apparent unhappiness. It just goes to show that if you care enough you can keep moving forward, despite the challenges presented by a new environment. And that the end of your world comes when you make it so, suggesting the mother still has the power to shape her future. That is why I think the author used such a powerful statement at the end, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism and the potential for a brighter future.
900	9765	4	3	The character has what seems to be a new found confidence and a new joy of the plant that reminds her of her home land, comforting her and motivating her. The familiar scent and vibrant green triggered a sense of belonging she hadn't realized she was missing. She says when those things come back – this feeling of groundedness and purpose – she will try hard to complete the test. She is setting a time, a personal deadline fueled by this renewed spirit, to push herself. As most people try to do, she's leveraging positive emotions to overcome a challenge, hoping that the comfort of her roots will give her the strength to succeed, and ultimately this connection will enable her to finish strong.
901	9766	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows how sometimes you have to wait till the time is right for you to try again. For example, In the book it says “Madagascar periwinkle, its tag announced, ‘How strange to see it in a pot.’ Back home it just grew wild jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between roofs.” This shows that anything can be done when the time is right, even thriving in a new environment after struggling elsewhere, thus highlighting the story's theme of perseverance and patience.
902	9767	4	3	Emotions, symbolism, and unrealized potential are all reasons the author concluded the story that way. A key reason the author ended the story that way is to leave you with mixed emotions, such as sadness, hope, and wonder. The author evokes sadness by depicting the girl failing her test and longing for home. The feeling of hope emerges from the possibility that she might one day return home. The ending also creates a sense of wonder because the conclusion leaves many questions unanswered. The author uses symbolism in the concluding sentences, giving the plant and the geese a sense of importance. The plant, in particular, seems connected to the home she deeply misses. In the story's finale, the author leaves many perceptions open to interpretation, such as the importance of the plant and the reasons behind the move from a beloved place, making the ending resonate with lingering questions. That is why I think the author ended the story that way, prompting reflection and allowing readers to form their own conclusions.
903	9768	4	3	In the story, Winter Hibiscus, Saeng is fond of beautiful flowers that once grew in her homeland. Her favorite flower was the winter hibiscus that had beautiful red petals, as soft as velvet. Adjusting to a new school was hard, and she also failed a test that she had taken. So, what the story is trying to say is that nothing can be as good as what's at home, but sometimes you just need another chance at something, to show yourself and others what you are truly capable of achieving.
904	9769	4	3	I think he did because he wanted to show how he loved everything in life, embracing both joy and sorrow as essential parts of the human experience. This desire to capture the full spectrum of existence likely motivated his actions. He sought to express a profound appreciation for every aspect of the world.
905	9770	4	3	The reason why the author of the story ended the story like that is because after all the hard time that plant went through, it will still be put to the test at the end of the winter. The author said that the plant will take that test again; that test is surviving through the cold winter and blooming at the end of the winter, showing that the plant's struggle is cyclical and its ultimate success is perpetually uncertain.
906	9771	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. One reason is that the author is trying to say that she is going to overcome the obstacle (the test) no matter what. In the text it says ""it can make through the cold months,"" consuming her energy, which supports the last paragraph. Also, she is in a new country and is starting a new beginning. In the text it says ""Not like the same kind we had before."" This implies that things are different in this country and she will soon adjust to her new environment. Finally it says, ""this hibiscus is budding,"" which means she will bloom and flourish in time, suggesting a hopeful and resilient outlook for the future."
907	9772	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is by herself, and letting herself know that she is going to try the test she failed again. She is starting to get used to her new home now that she's found something, the familiar math problems, that reminds her of her life before she left, giving her the courage to persevere.
908	9773	4	3	The author ends the story like this so readers can understand the theme: you can always start over after a mistake. For example, Saeng failed her herb driving test, and it took a toll on her. She will try again in the spring, and it seems she figures that once she has renewed herself, she'll do better. This ending reinforces the idea that setbacks are not permanent and opportunities for a fresh start always exist, allowing for growth and improvement.
909	9774	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes sense to end on a note of hope and renewal. It's one of the main pieces of the story because it shows Saeng's resilience. ìIn the spring, when the snows melt and after return,î all she say is is when the snow is gone and the grass come back, I will start planting again and she would be happy with it, ìthis hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again,î she went to put her plants up again and tests them to see how them over so she can do them even again. Saeng loved this plant so much that she canít wait. But when it does she is going to plant a lot. That what the paragraph is saying Saeng is going to wait so he can plant a hibiscus. However, since she came to United States she loved the flower that very much. The paragraph emphasizes her connection to her heritage and her determination to create beauty and life even after facing challenges, showing her optimism for the future. Therefore, the ending is fitting because it highlights Saeng's enduring spirit and her ability to find joy in simple things.
910	9775	4	3	Because to her it is the best time to do things, a period brimming with warmth and nostalgia, cause all the happy memories return along with the geese flying overhead and the vibrant hibiscus blooming anew.
911	9776	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus is motivating her to test for her drivers test. The vibrant plant, a symbol of resilience, reminds her of her own determination. In the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, a hopeful sign of renewal, then she will take that test again, ready to face the challenge with renewed vigor.
912	9777	4	3	Several reasons, first, in spring she will have had more time to adjust to her new life and settle into a routine. Also, when the hibiscus starts budding, its vibrant color and familiar shape will make her feel comforted, as though it automatically brings back her childhood memories of her grandmother's garden. It also is a link to her past home in Vietnam, a tangible reminder of her roots. When the hibiscus adjusts to its new life in the ground soil, thriving in its new environment, she will adjust and be ready to take the test again, feeling a renewed sense of hope. It's as if, when the plant is ready to start budding, a symbol of resilience and growth, she will also be ready to face her challenges with newfound confidence. Therefore, waiting until spring offers both practical and emotional advantages, aligning her personal growth with the natural cycle of renewal.
913	9778	4	3	The author concludes the story with that sentence a vowed to the flower. It’s just stating that Saeng will come back and try again next year & see if it works out with the hibiscus. It implies a sense of hope and perseverance despite the present outcome. The vow signifies her dedication and intention to nurture the plant, indicating that she hasn't given up on the possibility of it blooming. Thus, the author concludes the story with that sentence a vowed to the flower.
914	9779	4	3	The author put the paragraph in to show that he/she cares about the flowers. Flowers only come out during spring and summer time, and that's when you plant and study all that grows in a garden. By doing this, she can pass the test and be happy with the garden, demonstrating a connection between effort, knowledge, and a rewarding outcome.
915	9780	4	3	"The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî ends the story with the paragraph ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" for a couple of reasons. Most of all because the hibiscus blooming represents hope - the plant will survive through the winter months and will grow again and become strong. So, too, will Saeng. Although Saeng is in a strange place where she doesnít want to be, struggling with English and feeling out of place, she is able to overcome adversity and hardship, drawing strength from the resilient plant. In the same way, the hibiscus can withstand the winter. This is why the author ends the story the way she does, to give the impression that Saeng still has hope for her future in America, and the determination to succeed."
916	9781	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng makes a vow to herself. ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" this vow means that she will start fresh, make changes, and adapt to her new life in America. She wants to avoid disappointing her mother, who has sacrificed so much for her education, and she won't be broken down by her memories of Korea. She concludes the story like this to show in the future how her life will change and how she would learn to like where she is now, suggesting a hopeful path towards embracing her new environment and finding success."
917	9782	4	3	"The author concludes the story by the paragraph that says, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" because the author wants to convey that Saeng isn’t going to quit. She is determined to take and pass the test. It also means that Saeng will wait for the right moment to take the test; she will wait till things get better. The situation that she is in improves because it says, ""The snow melt, the geese return, and hibiscus is budding,"" symbolizing a time of renewal and hope, suggesting her resolve strengthens with the promise of a fresh start."
918	9783	4	3	The author concludes the story with this last paragraph because by spring she will be ready to retake her test. It shows that like the geese who care and come back, she will have time to study and pass her test. In the story the author includes this last paragraph to truly show her dedication to eventually grow to be comfortable in her new home and to pass her driver's test all in good time, with the added implication of her diligence. Saeng wants to be comfortable with her new life but isn’t yet because of what one misses, the familiar comforts left behind. But she knows that after this she can go back and try again just like the geese do often our winter. This was a very effective way to end the story because it really communicated Saeng’s message of dedication and longing to overcome her obstacles, her new home and driving, thereby underscoring her resilience and determination.
919	9784	4	3	I think the author concludes like this because it's almost like a new beginning. The ending of the story makes you think that Saeng is going to get on with her life. It makes me think that Saeng plans to start her life over in comparison with the hibiscus. Once the plant starts over (rebuds) she will start over once again. It also shows that she is determined to continue on with her life in America. She will not let her life be distraught by her move from Vietnam. She hopes that she will be able to start her life over again. The ending is a cliff hanger to show that her story has not yet completely ended. It shows that there is still possibility that she can get on with her life. It also shows she doesn't let her failures control her. She is a strong young woman and is determined to overcome this, suggesting a hopeful and resilient future for her.
920	9785	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it’s a very good ending paragraph that grabs your attention a little bit. Also, it shows that the girl is determined to pass her test, so that makes you think this is a determined story. The ending leaves the reader with a sense of anticipation for the challenges the girl will overcome. This is why the author concluded the story with this paragraph.
921	9786	4	3	The author concludes the story this way to show that Saeng intends to try again. An example of her trying again is when she sees the hibiscus plant, now thriving, and realizes what it symbolizes to her: resilience and the possibility of new beginnings. Another example is her saying that she wants to plant the hibiscus herself so that she holds the memories forever, suggesting she's ready to actively participate in creating her future, rather than passively letting life happen to her. This renewed sense of agency and determination is why the author concludes the story in this manner, leaving the reader with a sense of hope for Saeng's future endeavors.
922	9787	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she was trying to say since the hibiscus is planted we are going to see how it does with the winter. And when spring arrives and it's still standing she can go take the test. I think the author was comparing the hibiscus to their life and obstacles they will go through, so if the hibiscus is still standing then that means everything will be fine to where she can go back and take the test, suggesting a sense of hope and resilience reflected in the plant's survival.
923	9788	4	3	The last paragraph of “Winter Hibiscus” describes determination and the growth of a person. Saeng says that when “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Just as the hibiscus bravely blooms, even in harsh conditions, Saeng will bloom forth and strive through the winter to try and succeed in passing her test. Saeng concludes by saying this as a realization that she can’t be sad forever about failing. She must be determined, like the persistent hibiscus, in order to pass the test. The next season will be a sort of renewal, starting fresh and coming out beautiful as does a hibiscus in bloom, demonstrating her resilience.
924	9789	4	3	"The Author of ìWinter Hibiscusî, Minfong Ho, concluded her story with the paragraph about how when the geese are there, and the hibiscus is blooming, Saeng will take her drivers test again, because she wanted to end on a happy note. In the beginning of the story, Saeng, who had just moved from Vietnam to the United States, failed her drivers test. She had found a plant they had back in Vietnam, but it made her sad. ìI mean itís not like the kind we had at ñ at-"" she found that she was still too shaky to say the words 'at home', lest she burst into tears again.î (Ho, 124). So by ending by describing positive things for the future, Saeng could think about that, and get her mind off of everything else, providing a sense of hope and renewal after a period of adjustment and sadness."
925	9790	4	3	"The author concludes the story with these paragraphs for a very good reason. In a way, she's just letting it go and will wait to take it again, understanding the timing wasn't right before. I think it's good that she found the flower, the hibiscus. That is because it let her and her mother, and in a way, made her better by offering a sense of hope and renewal. For example, when it says ""the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" it shows she's aligning her efforts with the natural cycle, suggesting patience and a belief in a more opportune moment, and ultimately accepting the test is only one part of her journey."
926	9791	4	3	The author concludes the story this way to show how the main character, Saeng has changed from the beginning of the story to the end. It shows a small amount of newfound confidence Saeng now has, as she decides to face a challenge she previously avoided. This ending also shows how much of an effect the “winter hibiscus” had on her, with bringing back memories of her old country and a sense of connection to her roots. If Saeng wouldn’t have found the hibiscus, she would have never started to reminisce about her old home and the life she left behind. This reminiscing not only reminded her of her past, but it also helped her compare her new home to her old home, highlighting both the differences and unexpected similarities. Through this she realized that life in America is not so bad, and that she still has a little bit of her old home with her everyday, represented by the hibiscus. This realization gave her just enough hope and confidence to want to try the driving test again, symbolizing her willingness to integrate and build a life in her new environment. This ending effectively showcases the change of heart Saeng feels for America and her small gain of hope and confidence, suggesting a more positive outlook on her future.
927	9792	4	3	The author decides to conclude the story with that because she wants the moral of the story to be burnt in your head. She believes that you will always have a chance to try again, and the flower restarts its cycle and gets another chance to bud, symbolizing that you can start over and try again just like the girl is going to do on the test. She is doing the test again when the story starts over, so she can do it with the flower, and the flower budding will support her and give her hope as she faces a new beginning.
928	9793	4	3	I believe that the author ends the story the way she did because it talks about both of the subjects, the hibiscus and the driving test. The author is trying to say that when she takes her driving test next spring the hibiscus, having bloomed and thrived, will give her confidence to pass her driving test, serving as a symbol of her own growth and readiness.
929	9794	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author ends the story in a way that shows that she wants to start fresh. I think this because when she is talking to her mom at the end of the story, she says “In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again.” She is saying that she wants to start over and adapt to her new country, the United States, after initially failing her driver's test. Also, I think this because she wants to wait until the seasons change to go take her test again, because she says “when the snow melts and the geese return.” She states this because she wants a completely new slate when she takes her test again, associating it with renewal and hope. That is why I believe she wanted to conclude her story this way, emphasizing her resilience and determination to embrace her new life.
930	9795	4	3	I think the author concludes the story like that because it's showing the time that will be passing. When it shows time passing, she's grown up more and maybe she'll be ready to take the test since now she knows how it is. Also because the hibiscus will be budding, that will make her feel more comfortable and relaxed because it all makes her feel more like a secure, home feeling. ìhibiscus is buddingî this way the flower will be starting new and so will she, giving her a sense of hope and a fresh start as she faces the challenge again.
931	9796	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she needs to adapt to the new country. She wants to wait when the hibiscus is budding, signaling its adjustment to the unfamiliar climate. The plant budding shows that it is adapting to a new environment just like Saeng must. The story shows that Saeng is not used to the new country; she cries when she sees the plants because it reminds her of her old home and the familiar comforts she left behind. The plant also comforts her, offering a tangible link to her past. When she adapts to the new country, mirroring the hibiscus's resilience, then she will take the test again, demonstrating her own newfound stability and readiness to embrace her new life.
932	9797	4	3	The author concludes this story with ìwhen they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because Saeng didn't pass her test and knew her mom would be mad, so that's why she got the flower. If she wouldn't have failed her test, she probably wouldn't have got the flower in the first place, a small comfort against the disappointment and her mother's likely reaction, but a symbol of hope for a future attempt.
933	9798	4	3	The author of the story Winter Hibiscus ends the story with Saeng saying a vow to herself because it shows how important the flower is to her. For example, the hibiscus flower gives her determination because it reminds her of home. Saeng says “If this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The hibiscus flower gives her confidence. It reminds her of her home in Vietnam before they moved to America. Therefore, the author concludes the story with that certain paragraph because it symbolizes the importance of the flower.
934	9799	4	3	"She feels very connected to this hibiscus plant because it reminds her of her homeland. I think she is trying to say when the hibiscus plant shows its inner budding, she will too. The plant has to try hard to produce flowers, and the sun has to care enough to melt the snow, so that means when it comes around to it, she needs to come out and melt all of her bad habits and get what she needs to do to pass the test. But still not forgetting where she came from and all the memories left behind. ""I vowed silently to herself, then I will take that test again."" The hibiscus, a living symbol of her roots and resilience, fuels her determination to overcome challenges and embrace her future without forsaking her past."
935	9800	4	3	In the story ìwinter @CAPS1î the author concludes the story with the last paragraph like that because when the season comes back around for budding she is going to be right back out there exsploring. Sheís going to want to learn more about the hibiscus and what they do. And she canít wait to start taking care of them as they start to bud, providing the necessary care for their growth. That's why they ended the story with that paragraph, highlighting her anticipation for the return of spring and her renewed engagement with the natural world.
936	9801	4	3	There are many reasons this paragraph is included. It shows the flower will emotionally encourage her when it is budding, because it will remind her of home. This is shown when she says ìa blossom of two would have blown into the wellî, evoking a specific image connected to her past. It reminds her of her homeland and its familiar sights. It also is to show she is adapting to her new home. when the geese flew by she saidîshe realized that many things that she thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now.î This shows how she is adapting and is now enjoying her new life, finding comfort in her surroundings. This final paragraph is important because it shows how her life is changing and how she is finding solace and familiarity in her new environment, indicating a positive transition.
937	9802	4	3	The author is saying that she will be ready soon enuff when the flowers begin to grow and the geese begin to come home, she will be ready to finally embrace the changing season and whatever it may bring.
938	9803	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she failed the driver's test. She is saying when it get's a little warmer outside and the plants grow in maybe she will then take the test again and hopefully pass. I know that she failed the test because it said"" As Saeng walks home after Failing her driver's test"". I guess that from the snow being on the ground cause her to make mistakes when taking the test, perhaps making it harder to see the road clearly or navigate safely. In conclusion, that’s why the author concludes the story with this paragraph."
939	9804	4	3	In ì@CAPS1 Hibiscus,î the author concludes the story with ìin the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,î to make a point. She needs all of those things to happen for her to be sound enough to take the test again. The melting snow represents a fresh start, the return of the geese symbolizes hope and a return to normalcy, and the budding hibiscus embodies new growth and resilience after a harsh winter. Only when she witnesses this full cycle of renewal and feels the accompanying sense of optimism will she be ready to face the challenge again, signifying that her internal state needs to be aligned with the promise of spring for her to succeed.
940	9805	4	3	The author ended the story this way because the plant represents new beginnings in which Saeng needs. Saeng failed her test & needed some comfort. She went to the greenhouse & spent $25 on a hibiscus plant that reminded her of her home. At the same time, the hibiscus plant reminded her that her new home is another new beginning. The hibiscus plant gives Saeng better hopes that starting over can be a good thing & that the next time she takes the test, she'll pass. It provides a tangible symbol of optimism, allowing her to envision a successful future despite the current setback.
941	9806	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to conclude by writing about geese. He also likes plants and the seasons that they bud. He vowed that he would take that test in the spring, looking forward to the renewal of the season. He can't wait until the snow melts so that way he can take the test, embracing the coming warmth and opportunity.
942	9807	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph is because she wants that same environment and everything she wanted before when she took the test, yearning for the familiar comforts and aspirations she possessed prior to the disruptive experience and hoping to recapture that sense of self and belonging.
943	9808	4	3	The author’s choice of words in the conclusion of the story, I believe, sent a signal to let the reader know that the story continues. But, I think that the strongest element is that to remind her of home, hinting at unresolved ties and a possible return, leaving the narrative open-ended.
944	9809	4	3	"The author @CAPS1 the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself. in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She @CAPS1 it with this because she begins the story with Saeng failing her driver's license test. She was also thinking that the Winter Hibiscus was good luck after it goes away, and how she is familiar with @CAPS3, which would be the geese; she put @CAPS3 together, and that’s why she said when the geese come back and the snow melts. That is why she said it, connecting her renewed attempt to a time of hope and rebirth."
945	9810	4	3	"I think Saeng concluded with this story because there is always time to make up for the past if the past allows you to, meaning that @CAPS1 didn’t pass the test. I feel she meant that, ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to me this means that even though it is snowing outside there is always next spring to start growing back up the vegetable garden. This also relates to Saeng even though she failed the test there is always another chance we can make up for that loss and retry and try to succeed at this one, showcasing resilience and the possibility of future success despite current setbacks."
946	9811	4	3	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with this sentence: “Saeng vowed silently to herself in spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The Winter Hibiscus symbolizes her fondness of the place she used to live before. “It’s not a real one. I mean not the kind we had at—at,” she was still too shaky to say the words “at home.” When the hibiscus buds, she will still be fond of her home but she will have adapted better to her current environment. The geese will have returned to their home, meaning that she will find a place to call home in this place one day. When she finds that place, she will find herself ready to “take the test” or do things normally. The author concluded the story with that sentence to show that Saeng will eventually grow into her new life, suggesting a hopeful future where she embraces her new surroundings while cherishing her past.
947	9812	4	3	"The author concluded the story like that because she was being positive. Like the geese are coming back, she is positive that she can take the test again. She knows that she will pass the test. In the story she said, ""Many things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This means that when she had just moved here, she thought that everything was strange because she had not seen anything like this before. Now, as she is living here, she would get used to it because she knows what will happen; nothing will become strange to her anymore since this is her home now, and she has found a sense of belonging."
948	9813	4	3	The reader thinks the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the girl is saying she will try again, and take that test. In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng, the girl, took a test and failed it. And she got this flower that brings back memories from the past and decided she will take this test now that things are going to get better again. Also, when the girl saw those geese flying over her, she knew they will be coming back, coming back after winter in the spring, and when they do, her flower will blossom, the one that brings back good memories from the past, and she will retake that test and pass. These details suggest a hopeful outlook, making the conclusion fitting as it implies Saeng's renewed determination and anticipation for a brighter future, one where she conquers her challenges.
949	9814	4	3	The author concludes the story with that story because she loves her homeland, loves nature, and loves her mother. She loves the greenness and can't wait until spring comes. So, she will take the test of being out of place to herself, and that is why she concludes the story that way, showcasing a deep personal connection to her roots and surroundings.
950	9815	4	3	The author of the story ìWinter Hibiscusî concludes her story this way to demonstrate the girls determination and to leave the reader anticipating more. I say this because obviously Saeng is determined to do well in her new environment, as evidenced by her diligent studies and efforts to adapt, but leaving the story hanging just as she seems poised for a breakthrough builds excitement for more action and the potential for her future success. This ending emphasizes her resilience and hints at the challenges and triumphs that still await her.
951	9816	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is getting used to living in a new place. Towards the end of the text, Saeng says that many things she thought were strange before had become familiar to her. The winter hibiscus, a splash of color in the stark landscape, was comforting, and reminded Saeng of her home. She says ìIn the spring when the snows meltî because she is beginning to get used to ìthe quiet repetition of season upon seasonî in her new home, understanding the rhythm of the land. The geese, which form a distinctive V against the sky, a sight that once felt alien, are becoming familiar to her. The last paragraph is an effective way to end the story because it shows that Saeng is becoming accustomed to her new surroundings and is hopeful about the future, suggesting a sense of belonging and acceptance that she has found in this new chapter of her life.
952	9817	4	3	When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author’s main purpose of these lines was to show she is adapting to circumstances, finding resolve in the cyclical nature of the seasons. Saeng is also comforted by memories of her homeland, finding a connection to her roots through the hibiscus and the imagery of spring, solidifying her determination.
953	9818	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,î to conclude that she will wait a little bit of time, until plants can be be planty so if she fails again, she will have something to hold on to. For example, when Saeng ìfailed the driving test,î she try to overcome the feeling of failing, by buying something that reminds her of her country and bring back the memories to past thro this time. Another example is when Saeng ìfelt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral,î she forgot about everything that was happening in her life, from moving to America to failing her test this feeling concentratted her on feeling like home again. In conclusion, the author conclusion, creates the belief that that the was Saeng gets over her problems is by remembering memories like the plant, that reminded her of her home country.
954	9819	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story this way to show that Saeng will be okay next year. She said how all the new things seemed weird to her when she first got here, but now they are second nature to her now, illustrating her adjustment. I think that the hibiscus is a symbol of hope and inspiration to her. I think that she finally realizes that she is in @LOCATION1 to stay and cannot go back to Vietnam. So she has to accept that this is her home, and I think she is on her way to doing that, indicating a gradual acceptance of her new life.
955	9820	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she has faith for a new start. Saeng compares herself to the hibiscus. When the hibiscus is “flowering again,” she will retake the test. This shows that when the hibiscus restarts its life, so will she. Saeng feels that when the hibiscus is “strong enough to make it through the cold months,” then she is strong enough to pass her driver’s test and live in a new country. Winter and cold represent death, and spring represent a new life or beginning. Saeng thinks to herself, “in the spring… I will take the test again.” This symbolic parallel with the hibiscus underscores her resilient spirit and provides a hopeful outlook, suggesting a new beginning for Saeng and a renewed sense of hope.
956	9821	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author decided to end it with the sentence, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” because it shows that even though the main character Saeng failed once, she will try again too. The geese will be coming back to experience a new spring, and the hibiscus will be budding new flowers, so it's like starting over again, and Saeng says that if both have made it after trying again, then she can as well, but this time she will succeed. Also, it shows the determination all living things have to succeed at their main purpose. The flower drives to re-bud, the geese drive at coming back again during the spring, and the main character drives at passing the test. The author of “Winter Hibiscus,” Minfong Ho, put that quote as the last line of the story for inspiration, to inspire people to continue on the path of life, and if you fail at a task, try again, giving you inspiration to help you continue to live your life.
957	9822	4	3	In the last paragraph of the story, Saeng vows to herself that she will take the driving test again in the spring. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope that nature brings to her. She describes peaceful things in nature, like the geese flying overhead and the vibrant hibiscus blooming, that she draws strength from because they remind her of her homeland. In this way, she’ll always have a little piece of her past with her. Throughout the story, Saeng relates to nature and pulls strength from it. Her mother has a garden, and she relates to it in that she has a different past, preferring natural foods like bitter melons over processed foods. This final paragraph shows the hope that the beautiful nature from her homeland has brought to Saeng, helping her adapt to living in a new place, and ultimately giving her the courage to try again.
958	9823	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she’ll hopefully be stronger. By that I mean she’ll feel more comfortable in her new environment and she won’t miss her home as much. Also, she tried to do well that year but felt she failed in a way because she didn’t get her grandmother what she had asked for and instead spent the money on something else. That is why I think the author added this paragraph to this story, offering a glimpse of hope amidst the lingering guilt and homesickness, suggesting a path toward adaptation and future growth.
959	9824	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because it shows the main character, Saeng, adapting and trying her best with her new life style. For example, when she vowed to herself in the last paragraph saying, ìin the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,î This implies that she is putting more effort in to what she do in her new environment and settings, demonstrating resilience in the face of unfamiliar challenges. This commitment suggests a growing sense of belonging. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show how someone is adapting to change.
960	9825	4	3	The author includes this because he’s using metaphors to explain how the author felt about Saeng’s personal life, revealing a sense of distance and perhaps a veiled critique through figurative language. This approach allows for a more nuanced portrayal than direct commentary would allow.
961	9826	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows Saeng's sympathy. She wants to help her mom with the garden because she disappointed her. For instance, she feels bad about upsetting her mom, and while her mom's gardening, she says, ""Here, let me help, mother,"" because her mom's frail beauty touched her. When Saeng told her mom she failed the driving test, she even knew not to look at her because she was upset, it says, ""Saeng didn't dare look her mother in the eye,"" which shows Saeng's concern for her mother's reaction. However, in the end, her mother was happy she got the plant, saying, ""It's a beautiful plant, I'm glad you got it,"" which reveals the mother and daughter have a close relationship, strengthened by shared appreciation. This is why Saeng's sympathy and willingness to better herself are effectively showcased in the story's conclusion."
962	9827	4	3	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" is about a young girl who cares for gardening over schoolwork. The given conclusion is explaining, when spring comes, and the winter hibiscus is gone, she will pass the school test she failed before. Saeng only cares for the winter Hibiscus right now, for example, the line ""I paid over nineteen dollars for it,"" explains she used all her money on this plant rather than any other food. Also the quote ""I failed the test"" with Saeng crying shows she failed it only because she was worrying about the hibiscus. She was so preoccupied with its well-being that studying took a backseat. In conclusion, over the spring, when the winter hibiscus is gone, Saeng will focus on school more rather than gardening. Maybe now she will pass her test and go back to her hobby of gardening, finding a better balance between her passion and responsibilities."
963	9828	4	3	The author has a good reason in which she concludes the story with this. The main character of the story, Saeng, moves to the United States from Vietnam and fails her driver's test. Saeng has not adapted to life in the United States, missing the familiar sights and sounds of home. When she sees a familiar hibiscus plant, she buys it for her memories of Vietnam, a tangible connection to her past. The author is trying to show that since Saeng planted the hibiscus during winter, a time of dormancy and waiting, when it blooms in spring, she will be ready to try to pass her driver's test because she will have adapted to life in the United States, just as the plant adapts to its new environment. The theme of the story would be if you are moving away from somewhere you grew up in, bring things that remind you of that place so you still have a little of that culture with you, easing the transition and fostering a sense of belonging in a new land. Therefore, the author begins and ends with the same subject, the hibiscus, symbolizing both Saeng's past and her potential future in America.
964	9829	4	3	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with a sentence about retaking the driver's test in the spring, to express the themes of adapting to circumstances and determination to succeed. The main character in the story, Saeng, is a **Laotian** immigrant. Because **America** is not her homeland, there are still many aspects of life here she is not accustomed to, and the story shows her struggle to adapt. For instance when she sees the flower “Madagascar periwinkle” she thinks “how strange to see it in a pot” because “Back home it just grows wild.” The last sentence of the story is symbolic when it says “and the geese return,” because the geese adapt to circumstances by flying south for the winter, just like Saeng is trying to do, and Saeng realizes their patterns are becoming familiar. The very last line says “I will take that test again.” This summarizes the determination Saeng has throughout the entire story. Not only is she determined to succeed in her driver’s test, but in other things as well. For example, when trying to plant the hibiscus Saeng observes that “the soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting her shovel into it.” Despite the difficulty, though, she “Dug out a hole” and knows it’s strong enough to move it through the cold months just like Saeng will be strong enough to overcome obstacles if she tries. The last sentence in the story is significant. It expresses important themes and lends valuable insight into Saeng’s character, showing her resilience and hope for the future.
965	9830	4	3	The author concluded the story with the paragraph to set the sonip theme. In the story, the @CAPS1 represents very important thing to Saeng – confidence, beauty, adaptation– some things she can apply to herself, & her memories of her old homeland. She had failed the driving test. Afterwards, she bought the @CAPS1 to comfort her homesickness. I saw the @CAPS1 as a sort of metaphor to Saeng: the same @CAPS1, but growing differently in a different area just as she is still the same but in a new home. The significance of the last paragraph is mainly about the @CAPS1 budding. It represents to Saeng her homeland; by the @CAPS1 blossoming, it can represent her love for the homeland. When the author wrote “then I will take that test again” it is referring to the new confidence she @MONTH1 have later when the @CAPS1 blooms (another @CAPS1/person metaphor), highlighting that Saeng's growth mirrors the plant's, suggesting her eventual success and integration.
966	9831	4	3	The author @PERSON1, concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph to show Saeng starting over. In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, @CAPS1 to her life, is that she is starting fresh in a way. Although she @MONTH1 miss her old life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine toothed comb, she is making an effort and “take that test again.” By relating the test, she shows that she is not ready to give in to the @CAPS2 of loss and to her grief, demonstrating resilience and hope for the future.
967	9832	4	3	The author ends the story with “when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because she is concluding that the hibiscus comforts her and once the plant is well and alive, she will be comfortable to take the test. In reality, seeking comfort from a plant seems naive, but it's not that she has comfort in the plant itself; it's that the hibiscus reminds her of her home, which she misses dearly. It is a tangible piece of her past in this new, foreign land. Once the plant is thriving, mirroring the vibrant life of her tropical home, she believes that it will comfort her enough to pass the test, giving her the strength and connection to her roots that she needs. In conclusion, this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph; the hibiscus represents hope and a return to a sense of belonging that will empower Saeng.
968	9833	4	3	"I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how as the plant will grow, so will Saeng. After failing the driver's test, Saeng goes to the greenhouse and finds the Hibiscus plant, which reminds her of her true home back in Vietnam, where they had similar plants. The plant then makes her think about all the memories, and she is comforted by them even though she is sad. She uses this plant as a tool for comfort to help her think about where she is from and all the good memories to help raise her spirits. So, to boost her confidence, she decides to plant it. ""The 'winter hibiscus' was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around."" Then she sees geese flying in the sky, which is a kind of symbol of that day, something to remember it by, so ""the next year, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" she will take the test again. These things bring back good memories, which help to make her stronger, implying that her resilience, like the hibiscus, will blossom in time for her to face future challenges."
969	9834	4	3	I think Saeng needs to take the test over because she wants to improve her grade. Saeng is worried about the snow, even in the spring, because she is thinking about the flowers getting covered by it. Saeng's mother let her help with the peppers and melons, and also let her help at the state dinner. Therefore, Saeng is dedicated to her studies and responsibilities.
970	9835	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants us to know that she’s not giving up on her test. The author wants to inform the readers that she’s not giving up; “then I will take that test again” which clearly states she still has hope and determination. The author wants to continue on her test to find the right flower, showing her resilience. This is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph, solidifying her commitment to her goal.
971	9836	4	3	The author concludes this story with that paragraph because during winter everything dies down till spring where everything is lively again, the Saeng would feel more motivated to do well on the test. Saeng is sort of like the plant, striving and worrying in the winter and then blooming beautifully in the spring, suggesting a cycle of hardship followed by renewal. Also, I think the memories that the winter hibiscus plant brought her, particularly its resilience and unexpected beauty in a harsh season, motivated her to stop staying in the past and move on towards the future, embracing the potential for growth and success that the spring represents.
972	9837	4	3	He wrote this because he is talking about weather changes and how they are affecting local ecosystems.
973	9838	4	3	The author probably concludes the story with that paragraph because she is basically relating the plants to herself, meaning as the plant blooms, she will too by taking the test. Her reason is because reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Basically, she did as the geese by lifting her head, watching as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly facing into the distance. This is why I believe the author put this to conclude the story, because she was comparing herself to the geese and does as they did, showing a willingness to embrace the future and the changes it holds.
974	9839	4	3	The author describes last quote because he wants her dream to achieve. He describes she realized that many of the things that she had thought the quiet repetition of season, almost familiar to her now. Saeng is from Vietnam, and her family have an American dream. So the author wants that her family adapt their new life in America. This portrayal underscores the author's hope for Saeng and her family's success and integration.
975	9840	4	3	She says this because right now it is winter and flowers cannot grow in the winter due to how cold it is. So she is saying when spring is back, a time when conditions are more favorable, she will take the test of growing the flowers again. In conclusion, this is why the author states that conclusion at the end of the paragraph.
976	9841	4	3	The author ends the story with that paragraph to give you a sense of hope and determination for the future that dwells within Saeng at that time. Throughout the story, it seemed as though Saeng was giving into despair at the remembrance of her homeland; she wasn't doing so well in her new country, and she had realized it the most when she had failed her driving test. But when she walked past the flower shop and saw all the plants that used to bloom so freely and beautifully in her homeland confined in those tiny pots and fighting to survive, it reminded her of herself here in @LOCATION1. As she began to plant her hibiscus, she again compared herself to it, and that is why when her plant blooms so well in the spring, she will pass that test, signifying her own resilience and adaptation.
977	9842	4	3	The author concludes this saying it to the story because he thought it would go because at Valkay about how the hibiscuses are yet budding in the winter & and how all the geese will return to the home and stay there because they hate the winter, finding warmth and refuge from the cold.
978	9843	4	3	The author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few reasons. One reason why is because of the change in Saeng's attitude. In the beginning of the story Saeng is upset and has no hope of adjusting to her new home, but by adding that paragraph at the end of the story it shows that she has hope, and she's not going to give up on building a life there. Another reason why this paragraph concludes the story is to show that life does go on even in the toughest situations, providing a sense of closure. The fact that a new season will begin figuratively shows Saeng will not always feel this way, that she too will change and adapt. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with that paragraph for a few good reasons, effectively highlighting Saeng's evolving perspective and the enduring cycle of life.
979	9844	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, I think, because since the girl failed her test, the bud reminds her of her grandmother's long grey hair, and I guess that gives her good luck. So when the winter passes by and the springtime hits, and those buds start to come back out, that's when she will take her test again. It suggests a cycle of hope and renewal, implying that the girl's failure isn't the end, but rather a pause before a fresh start, which is why the author made this statement the last sentence of the story.
980	9845	4	3	One reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it tells you that Saeng is confident in her newfound skills. It also tells you she won't give up on mastering them, despite any challenges she may face. And it shows that she is willing to take her ability to the next level through continued practice and dedication. This is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph, leaving the reader with a sense of Saeng's determination and potential.
981	9846	4	3	"The author most likely intended to show the hopeful enlightenment of Saeng's complex dilemma. In the phrase, ""when they come back"" the author most likely refers to the hibiscus flowers that represent the fond memories of her homeland and a tangible link to her past. The author illustrates Saeng's struggle adapting to her new life through a ""test"" of planting the buds just as she had done back home with her grandmother, highlighting the importance of familiar traditions. This test represents the potential achievement of adaptation to her new life and the possibility of carrying her heritage forward. For that reason, the author concluded her story with the paragraph indicating Saeng will indeed take that test again, suggesting an optimistic outlook for her future and her ability to reconcile her past with her present."
982	9847	4	3	The author decided to conclude the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination to adapt to her new life. In the third paragraph on the second page the author writes, “Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile… That atleast, she could hold onto.” After failing her driver’s test Saeng was feeling foreign and alone. She desperately looked to the flower as a reminder of her homeland, Vietnam, seeking solace in its familiarity. The flower brought back comforting memories for her, so she bought one of the plants and returned home. After a discussion with her mother Saeng understands that she must cope with her new home, much like the flower must adapt to its new surroundings to survive. By concluding the story with that stated sentence, the author is informing the reader that Saeng must “blossom” in her new home in order to do well, suggesting growth and prosperity. She still needs time for this, as the flower needs time to plant its roots into the ground and establish itself in a new environment, highlighting the patience required for successful adaptation.
983	9848	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, perhaps to show confidence that she would do everything over again if she had to. For example, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" so basically she's saying she's willing to take that step, that chance, demonstrating a resilient spirit. The author ended the story with this confidence and encouragement, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and determination for Saeng's future."
984	9849	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” She does this to end in hope of taking the test again and doing good. Also the author ends it this way because Saeng is believing in herself, showing her resilience, so she made a vow to do something. Hopefully that will encourage her more and also motivate her as she looks forward to a new opportunity to succeed.
985	9850	4	3	The author concludes the story with a paragraph basically stating that the winter's coming; things are going to die off then come back next spring. She's referring to the plant. I think she is basically keeping track of the memories it left her and the thoughts that came to mind when she used her senses to connect with the flower. Saeng is anxious to see how the flower buds next spring and what other new things she will experience.
986	9851	4	3	Well I think the author concludes the story like that because he is showing her her attitude, better known now as changing, so she is going to put her mind to whatever she has to do. She is going to take the test again with some pride and try in the spring when the snow goes away, demonstrating a newfound resolve to tackle the challenge ahead.
987	9852	4	3	The author decides to end the story with the paragraph to show many things. First of all, the author uses the ending paragraph to show optimism. The whole story had been sad but the ending shows some hope. In the beginning it says, ìa grief of loss so deepÖ ì and at the end it says, ì I will take that test again.î This shows how her attitude changes from cynical to hopeful, illustrating her resilience. Another reason why the story is ended with that paragraph is to show how Saeng was accepting. When the story says that the geese were , ì almost familiar to her now.î demonstrates that even though Saeng is sad to leave her home, she is adapting quite well, suggesting a sense of belonging in her new environment. Therefore, the author ends the story with an inspiring paragraph to show change for the better, ultimately leaving the reader with a feeling of hope for Saeng's future.
988	9853	4	3	"The author is concluding the story with that paragraph stating when spring and the following year comes again then she will take the test again. Meaning she will plant the flowers and get them to grow again, hoping she doesn’t fail at doing so. For example, ""Mrs. Lambert, liked it, this sharp bitter melon that left a golden after taste on the tongue."" It seems the narrator views this as a recurring challenge, a cycle of hope and potential disappointment tied to the seasons and her ability to cultivate life."
989	9854	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to end it on a good note and send a good message: they are not going to quit because they failed the first time. Instead, they will learn from their mistakes and persevere. The initial setback serves as a catalyst for renewed determination, highlighting their resilience and commitment to their goal, assuring readers that their journey, though challenging, will continue.
990	9855	4	3	I say the only reason why the author included that last paragraph was to show she was not going to give up easy. She was still going to take it again, she might get good luck from the hibiscus. Saeng was walking home one day from failing her driver’s test and she realizes that she recognizes a flower, so she went to a florist to see if she can buy it. When she does purchase it, she goes home and gives it to her mom, and they plant it. So maybe it can bring back good memories from her home town or just good luck, I think, and this detail serves to emphasize her resilience and hope for future success.
991	9856	4	3	The author concludes the story with this passage because it's symbolic. When the geese come back in the spring, it will be like a new beginning. When the hibiscus is budding, it has a new life. When all this happens, Saeng will have a new fresh start too. Leaving the story to end like this is a cliff-hanger for some, leaving readers wanting more; knowing she failed her test, you want to know if Saeng will pass it in the spring, a fresh new start. Everything and everyone will have new starts when the beginning of the new season comes around; when the hibiscus blooms, it will be like she has the new ability to overcome obstacles, forging new connections with her past and finding comfort during hard times. The hibiscus symbolizes all this, suggesting hope and resilience as Saeng faces future challenges.
992	9857	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because this is what the story was all about. Saeng saw what happens in the winter and when it comes back around she tries to memorize it so that she can know what will happen, understanding the cycle of seasons and preparing for the future.
993	9858	4	3	The author ends the story this way because by the time winter ends she will have adapted to her new society, just like the hibiscus, which, despite its initial fragility in the unfamiliar climate, will bloom again in the spring.
994	9859	4	3	"The young girl Saeng from Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"" has moved from her homeland of Vietnam to the United States. She was hoping to get her driver's license but failed the test, leaving her disheartened. The sight of the hibiscus at the local nursery comforts her, its vibrant color a reminder of Vietnam's warmth and beauty. When she purchases it, her mother is initially concerned about the price, a significant amount for their family. However, she sees how homesick her daughter is, recognizing the deep longing in Saeng's eyes, and becomes understanding. After carefully planting the hibiscus, Saeng watches the geese fly overhead, noting their seasonal migration, and understands that every year they change their habitat. The geese inspire Saeng, their journey mirroring her own, along with the resilient hibiscus, and she promises herself that in the spring, when the snow melts away, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, then she will take the test again, ready to embrace her new life while cherishing her roots."
995	9860	4	3	The author uses this paragraph because it works perfectly as an end. With this saying tell @LOCATION1 that all the snow is gone she will take the test again. If one reads now between the lines it says more than just this. She really likes the hibiscus, and when the hibiscus goes back to life in the spring, she will have new energy to take the test again. From her experience with the hibiscus we can see that this plant really influenced her, because this plant reminds her so much of her old home. Also we can see that everything and everybody should get a second chance; in her case, it is the test she wants to take again. Also, in the spring she lives a couple months in the @LOCATION1, and she will adjust herself to this new situation. At the moment she is just homesick, even if her home is the @LOCATION1 now. So the hibiscus is good for her; it is something she can hold onto from her old home, providing comfort and a sense of connection during this transitional period.
996	9861	4	3	The author, Minfong Ho, finishes the story like this to show the overcoming of obstacles. The story shows the many difficulties Saeng faces when leaving her old home and coming to her new one. In the day described, she fails a driver's test, doesn't eat lunch with her friend, and spends all her money on a plant from her old home. Also, this paragraph shows how the Hibiscus symbolizes her. The plant is not in its native home, faces many difficulties: the cold, its small pot, and even its general surroundings. In every way, the plant is in the same circumstances as the main character, and the last paragraph is used to link them, demonstrating that even in challenging new environments, there is hope for growth and adaptation, much like Saeng herself.
997	9862	4	3	The reason why the author used this paragraph is because he was sad that the snow goes away in springtime, that all, a visual representation of the end of a season he perhaps cherished and its inevitable transformation.
998	9863	4	3	The last paragraph means only one thing: to be like a Hibiscus @CAPS1, to take the test again of life. It suggests perseverance and resilience. See, will come back in the spring just like the Hibiscus will, showcasing a cycle of renewal. So as you can see, the last paragraph had a very good meaning to it, offering a message of hope and the promise of rebirth after challenges.
999	9864	4	3	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is willing to change, and she hopes to do so by the time spring comes. By change, Saeng wants to feel comfortable in @LOCATION1 and be able to remember things from where she used to live without breaking down and crying each time. Also, the author uses the image of the geese because they must leave home every year and face the change, so Saeng can deal with it as well, suggesting her willingness to adapt to her new surroundings and embrace the future.
1000	9865	4	3	"The reason why the author ends the story with that statement is because when you fail at something you need time to dust yourself off and try again. When Saeng fails her driving test she is disappointed. After failing her test she went to greenery where she saw flowers of her homeland. Then where she bought the hibiscus. It reminded her of how things were different. And how things change when you go to a different place. Sometimes they aren't so pleasant at first, but you get use to them. Like when she first saw the geese flying in a ""V,"" she thought of how strange it was. But now it is familiar to her. After failing her driving test, Saeng learns that even though things have changed, she needs to be able to try again; this ability to adapt and persevere is key to navigating new experiences and overcoming setbacks."
1001	9866	4	3	She concluded the paragraph with that declaration to show that she is serious about her gardening commitment and that she won't garden until the Canada geese come back to her yard each spring, signaling the proper time.
1002	9867	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did, because Saeng is a nature freak. So she really likes nature and she would never ever hurt nature in her life, evidenced by her deep respect for the environment throughout the story, and I guess that they wanted to end off with a nice, hopeful paragraph reflecting her values. Ultimately, despite the setback, she needs to take that test again, armed with a renewed commitment to her principles.
1003	9868	4	3	The author concludes this story because it shows her determination. It says that she will keep on attempting to make an adjustment to her life till she accepts her new home. It also says that as the buds grow so will she, but more mentally than physically. And her taking the test again signifies that she has faith in herself that she will mature and grow up to be a person who misses their homeland but accepts the new home that they live in. That is why the author ended this way, highlighting a journey of resilience and the unwavering hope for eventual acceptance and growth in a new environment.
1004	9869	4	3	She is saying here that she will start a new leaf when spring comes around; she is going to start fresh and do better on her driving test. I think she concluded with this paragraph because this shows that Saeng is not a quitter and is going to try harder, demonstrating her resilience and determination to succeed despite facing setbacks.
1005	9870	4	3	"Reserved need to check keenly. Supplement appropriate details based on the existing information in the original text.

Therefore, a diligent review is not merely a step, but a cornerstone of success."
1006	9871	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the cold was brufield or the author never wanted to be around while the cold was in session. At the time it was really cold, implying an unpleasant and unwelcoming atmosphere that the author preferred to avoid, bringing the narrative to a close.
1007	9872	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One being the fact that she wants to show sympathy for the hibiscus, mirroring Saeng's own resilience in the face of challenges. Another reason would be showing that Saeng wants to make her mother very proud of her, especially given her mother's sacrifices. Meaning that she doesn’t want her mom to think that she is going to give up on her dreams. This also contributes to the reason that Saeng believes in herself and she truly thinks she can pass the test, despite any doubts she might have had. Lastly I think that this last paragraph showed how Saeng wants people to know that even something as small and meaningless as a plant can help her overcome obstacles, and lead her to her dreams. The author chose this paragraph to end the story because of the main fact that how we know that Saeng will not stop believing in herself, and will continue to strive towards her goals, inspired by the hibiscus and her mother's unwavering support.
1008	9873	4	3	"The author of the story chooses to end the story with that sentence because the story is mainly about how Saeng failed her drivers test, but when she saw the hibiscus, it reminded her of home and made her feel better. In paragraph @NUM1, Saeng says, ""And that rich, sweet scent – that was familiar too,"" talking about how nice the flowers were and how familiar they were because she recognized the scent. Saeng was already upset about leaving her home in @LOCATION1, then coming to @LOCATION2, and then failing her drivers test just made it worse, but then she saw the flower, and it reminded her of her home, so she felt a little better, offering her a sense of comfort amidst her challenges. So when the author uses that quote, they end the story that way to show that she will have enough courage to try again when the flower blooms."
1009	9874	4	3	The author concludes the story like that to show emphasis. Saeng vowed that so that it will teach her everything lives with hope & adaptation. She means that when everything returns and proves they survive, she will too. She will take that drivers test then. The author also wants to prove that people need to have faith in theirselves. You just need to get used to their surroundings. This is why the author concluded that way, highlighting the power of resilience and self-belief in the face of challenges, ultimately demonstrating that adapting to circumstances is key to overcoming obstacles.
1010	9875	4	3	"In stories, authors employ various techniques to achieve different effects. In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the story with a paragraph that evokes a ""touching"" response in the reader and effectively summarizes key elements of the narrative. The opening line, ""Saeng vowed silently to herself,"" uses imagery, creating a mental image of a solitary girl kneeling in the cold garden, whispering. This image contributes to the emotional impact of the conclusion. Furthermore, the concluding paragraph encapsulates themes explored throughout the story. The quote, ""When the geese return hibiscus is budding I will take that test again,"" directly references the hibiscus flower, a recurring symbol, the geese which appear at the story's end, and Saeng's initial failure on the test. In conclusion, the author's choice of this particular paragraph as the conclusion serves to reinforce the story's emotional resonance and tie together its central motifs, leaving a lasting impression on the reader."
1011	9876	4	3	The author concludes in the story that Saeng failed a winter test. She had been so preoccupied with the dormant hibiscus outside her window, a silent promise of warmer days, that her studies suffered. But because of her love of the hibiscus plant, with its vibrant blooms a symbol of resilience and beauty, spring, the season of rebirth and growth, will undoubtedly help her take the test again with renewed focus and hope, fueled by the hibiscus's imminent return to life.
1012	9877	4	3	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wanted the reader to know that just because she failed, that it doesn't mean her life is over. She will recuperate and try the same thing next year, demonstrating resilience and a refusal to be defined by a single setback, thus offering a message of hope and perseverance.
1013	9878	4	3	The author uses this paragraph to conclude to show she’s going to give the test another try as well as her new surroundings. For example, the story says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Saying that she is getting used to where she is now and is willing to give it a chance. Almost as if she doesn’t find it that bad as she thought at first, it being different and not her home and where she was used to being. This newfound acceptance suggests a willingness to engage with her present circumstances, hinting at a renewed determination to face challenges, including the test, with a more open and perhaps even optimistic perspective.
1014	9879	4	3	Maybe the author wrote that as the last sentence or paragraph because in the story she did something and failed at it, so she wants to do it again, driven by a desire to rectify her mistake. The memory of her previous attempt, and its subsequent failure, likely fuels a strong resolve to not only try again but to succeed this time. This final statement signifies a commitment to perseverance and a refusal to be defined by past shortcomings, ultimately suggesting a journey of growth and redemption that the author is determined to embark on.
1015	9880	4	3	The Author of ìWinter Hibiscusî ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes. It shows that Saeng has determination to overcome obstacles and it uses the plant as a metaphor, just like the rest of the story, the Hibiscus represents Saeng or adjusting to change. The plant ìdiesî in the winter and this is equivlent to Saeng not getting her drivers licens, but the plant will come back, representing determination or adjustment; this is why Saeng says she will go back and pass the test because she has adjusted and is now determined to overcome this obstacle, highlighting her resilience and adaptability in a new environment.
1016	9881	4	3	"After reading the quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test."" From the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, I think the author is trying to say that after the difficulties of winter and fall pass, she will be ready to face the challenge of planting again and regaining her confidence. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive ""V"" was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. Reflecting back, I feel Saeng felt that the geese were secretly affirming her decision, offering silent encouragement as she looked forward to spring and a renewed sense of purpose, confirming she was on the right path."
1017	9882	4	3	He ends the story this way to show that she wants to and is willing to overcome leaving her homeland. In the story she goes to a greenhouse to test herself. She finds a plant from her homeland, and it reminds her of her grandmother and the familiar scents of home. She finds other plants, and they remind her of her homeland, causing her to cry as memories flood back. I think she had a real connection with her grandmother, likely spending a lot of time with her in their garden. When they left their home country she probably cried for days; it's like she lost a part of her soul, but the visit to the greenhouse shows her resolve to heal.
1018	9883	4	3	The author includes this paragraph into the story because the girl started giving up on herself and felt sad from moving to the United States, failing her driver's test, and discovering the plant she bought wasn't real, all contributing to her low self-worth. Conversely, the author also intended to illustrate a turning point, showing her renewed self-esteem, increased confidence, and a determination not to succumb to despair, ultimately showcasing her resilience.
1019	9884	4	3	The author leaves the story with those words, because it shows the reader a large metaphor in the story, although unfinished, it is self-explantory that the metaphor compares Saeng and her test to the perennial nature of the winter hibiscus. They both have something in common, which is that they both come back; Saeng comes back to complete her test, while the winter hibiscus comes back, buds, and lives again. I can relate to this, because I remember I entered in a triathlon, and my goal was to place first. I placed @NUM1 overall, then the next year came, and I trained until the triathlon came again, and I placed @NUM2, so like the winter hibiscus, I came back and completed my goal, demonstrating the enduring persistence needed to achieve desired outcomes.
1020	9885	4	3	The Author includes that part in his story because it's talking about nature and all the beautiful things in nature. There's the birds, the bees, tall green grass, the white picket fence, and in the story there are those same types of things that are in nature, reinforcing the themes and imagery he wishes to convey.
1021	9886	4	3	The author views the hibiscus plant as a new start. For example, when she says ìIn the spring, whch the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î She failed the first time, and the hibiscus, acquired afterward, represents hope and a fresh perspective; she believes that the plant's growth mirrors her own potential for success. With the hibiscus budding, she anticipates a parallel blossoming of her abilities, suggesting that the plant serves as a tangible symbol of her renewed determination and confidence, indicating that the next time she takes the test, she'll pass it. This connection between the hibiscus's growth and her own success highlights the plant's significance as a symbol of new beginnings and the author's optimistic outlook.
1022	9887	4	3	The author include these paragraph in the story because it's spring, when the snows melt and the geese return. I think the author is talking about winter when it snows and keeps snowing until spring arrives and then the snow starts to melt away because the sun comes out. One reason is that the author is talking about how the weather changes when the seasons change, illustrating the cyclical nature of the year.
1023	9888	4	3	She was upset with herself because she bought the hibiscus and not the plant seeds. So she starts crying because she remembered how pretty their old one used to be, with its vibrant red petals unfurling in the summer sun. When the snow melts and the flowers start to bloom is when she is going to take the test again. The author ended the paragraph like that to show a new beginning next year, a chance to try again with renewed hope and the promise of spring's beauty.
1024	9889	4	3	I believe that she included this because she wanted to show how important it was to her. For example, when she says in the spring she will take the test again, I think that meant she will work harder to make sure she does everything right the next time. It suggests a renewed commitment, indicating she will dedicate more time and effort to preparing. This demonstrates her determination. So that she can say she follows through on things that are important to her, showcasing her dedication and personal integrity. This inclusion highlights her commitment to achieving her goals and reinforces the significance of the test to her self-perception.
1025	9890	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test. It takes time for a hibiscus to bud, suggesting that her progress, like the flower's, requires patience and is not yet complete. It sounds like a good end, and she would not want to take the test in the snow, implying that the timing wasn't right for her to demonstrate her abilities.
1026	9891	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to let the readers know how Saeng feels about the hibiscus. I think the author concludes this because he is telling the reader that the hibiscus gives Saeng good luck, and with this good luck, she will pass the test. In the story, it tells us how much Saeng adores the plant. For example, when she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool. That's why the author uses that paragraph at the end to indicate how Saeng feels and how it makes her feel confident, suggesting that the hibiscus, a source of comfort and perhaps luck, will contribute to her success.
1027	9892	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to leave readers guessing and wondering what will be next. You can tell by the tone of the last paragraph, ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î The author seems to leave at tone of suspense, making us question whether Saeng will succeed next time or if new challenges will arise, leaving her journey open to endless possibilities.
1028	9893	4	3	By ending the story in the way the author has in the short story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author provides a sympathetic understanding for the reader of Saeng and her struggle to live in another country and her sadness of wishing to be back home. I think the author was attempting to end the story with a strong feeling for a strong note of Saeng's personality to draw the reader back into what they had just read. For example, by repeating the statement on the test saying “I will take that test again,” the author gives us that understanding that Saeng has not given up and lets the reader know she will stand and live strong, highlighting her resilience in the face of adversity. This ending reinforces Saeng's determination and offers a glimpse of hope, ultimately solidifying the reader's empathy for her journey.
1029	9894	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because now she has something to work for. The author could have also concluded the story with this paragraph because she must wait that long till she can take it again; also, Saeng could wait to see the plant grow and get bigger and stronger. These are reasons why I think the author concluded with that paragraph, showing how the future holds promise and anticipation.
1030	9895	4	3	The author concludes the story here to show that Saeng would not give up. She simply set a time for her to try again, indicating resilience. Saeng wants to make it in this world and wants to have a good life, so she tries new things, demonstrating her proactive approach to achieving her aspirations and confirming her unwavering determination.
1031	9896	4	3	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" is a good story about a foreign girl trying to adapt to America. She likes tropical flowers. The reason why the author chose to write the last paragraph like that is because it finishes the story right. That ending when the man goes away and the flowers start to grow suggests she will try to fit in during the spring. This neatly concludes her initial struggles and hints at future acceptance."
1032	9897	4	3	I think the author used this paragraph for the ending because its meaning reflects Saeng's deep connection to her garden, something truly special to her. Also, when all the snow melts, she will take the test and hopefully get her driver's license. This creates a sense of anticipation and closure, hinting at a positive future for Saeng.
1033	9898	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because of new beginnings. What I mean by this is, the hibiscus represents new beginnings. She says “When the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This will be a new start for her. The plant blooming makes her happy and reminds her of her grandmother. She’s saying by the time the spring comes around she would be ready for a new obstacle, as so for the hibiscus plant, suggesting a cycle of growth and renewal.
1034	9899	4	3	I believe the author chooses to end the story with this paragraph because it symbolizes closure. The sight of her hibiscus plant, a vibrant piece of her mother's garden now thriving in her own home, represents her connection to home. But she realizes, by the sight of the geese flying south, that everyone has to leave home at some point to find their own way. She has now come to terms with what is happening and the change it brings, and she will try again for her driver's license soon, embracing this next chapter. When the hibiscus buds again, a symbol of resilience and renewal, it will be deeply symbolic to her, representing her own fresh start, and that is when she will be ready to try once again.
1035	9900	4	3	"I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph because sheís showing she is trying and wants another chance. She realized her mistakeís and is ready to start over. Even though she failed by trying to grow her hibiscus in the winter, she is trying to start over when the spring comes in. For example, in the story, it stated the ""winter hibiscus"" was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and familiar to Saeng. Showing she is ready to get back to her regular season of planting which is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph, as a symbol of her renewed hope."
1036	9901	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks it'll bring her good luck in the test. When she goes back to take the test she'll have the comfort of her homeland, symbolized by the hibiscus plant, to encourage her to pass the driving test. When she takes the test again, she'll be more apt to pass due to the comfort of home and the fact that she'll be used to the area being different from her homeland. In order for her to do well in the test she needs something to help her have a little bit more confidence in herself. Having things to remind her of home and the house that she lives at now can greatly assist her in being confident, leading to a better chance of success.
1037	9902	4	3	She said that she was going to take the test again because she wanted to show her mom that she could do it and pass it this time, instead of worrying over her old home and past failures. This renewed determination shows her commitment to succeeding and moving forward.
1038	9903	4	3	I think that this shows hope because she had really missed her homeland and kind of found peace and serenity by being around them; she says, “That at least she could hold on to,” meaning the bud. I think that she was very upset because of missing home; she missed having her grandmother wash her hair and put a dok mallk into it. I think that since she really had nothing else but the flowers that reminded her of her homeland, the text said, “where was the fine-toothed comb, the hibiscus hedge, the well, her gentle grandmother?” She was missing all these things, so I think that by putting her in this position, it has brought her to a place of where she not only misses the people from her homeland but the beautiful things as well, and how she always has kind of a part of home with her because of the flower, offering a small comfort and connection to her past amidst her longing.
1039	9904	4	3	"In the last paragraph, the author uses ""when they come back, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test"" because Saeng finally found comfort. After moving from her homeland to the United States, she felt homesick. For example, she comes across this flower that reminds her of the time she spent in her homeland. She remembers her grandmother's smell because of the plant. So when she finally got home to her mother, she showed the flower to her. They both planted the flower, and Saeng got a sense of relief. That's why she vowed that when winter was over and spring came she would take that test, because she had a sense of home in her, that gave her encouragement and strength, showing that even when you are in a different area and you feel lost, there's always something that can make you remember the memories and time spent where you came from. Ultimately, the hibiscus flower and her mother's presence fostered a sense of belonging, providing Saeng with the resolve to face her challenges."
1040	9905	4	3	The author concludes the story like this because it shows that she is determined to pass the test, despite her anxieties. It is also like if the birds can instinctively fly south, facing their own challenges, then she, with effort and resolve, can certainly pass that test. This parallel underscores her belief in her own capabilities and reinforces her commitment to overcoming the academic hurdle.
1041	9906	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author does this for several reasons. The author wants to show you that Saeng still has hope and that she believes she can make it right, demonstrating her resilience after facing a setback. Also, to show Saeng will still try and adapt to her surrounding and make friends, suggesting a willingness to integrate despite the initial difficulties. Saeng is also determined that she will pass the test next time she takes it, highlighting her ambition and perseverance. Last, it is emphasizing the conflict and how Saeng overcame it by resolving to face the challenge again, showing her spirit.
1042	9907	4	3	"I believe the author ended this story with this paragraph because life lives on. ""When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" proves that she's moving on with life and so will all the creatures in the world, embracing the cyclical nature of seasons and personal growth. Also even though she moved to a new country doesn't mean she can't still enjoy the things from her homeland, ""but she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to the Big Mac,"" highlighting the enduring connection to her roots amidst change. That's why the author put that last paragraph to show that life lives on, demonstrating resilience and the ability to find comfort in familiar aspects of her identity, even in a new environment."
1043	9908	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she really isn't worried about when they take the test again; she's only concerned with the plants she picked out, showing a shift in focus. Also, she knows that it will be a really long time before she takes the test again, which gives her more time to study and get more prepared and focused, suggesting a sense of optimism. The author also ends this article with this paragraph because she wants to let the readers know that since she failed the first time, she will be back again to take it over, and nothing will stop the author from trying again, highlighting her resilience.
1044	9909	4	3	It shows not to give up; it ends almost the same way it began; it shows that people should not stay too attached to the past—each are reasons why I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It shows that people should not give up because even though she failed her test then, she will try again later to pass it, demonstrating resilience. Also, the story ends the same way it begins, by her taking the test or getting ready to, which provides a circular structure and a sense of closure. One last thing is that it shows that people shouldn’t become too attached to the past because if they look at one thing that reminds them of it, they @MONTH1 fall apart; that is why she takes the test, to see if she can look at the familiar flowers without falling apart. This ultimately underscores the importance of moving forward and not being defined solely by past experiences.
1045	9910	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to end on a happy yet motivating note. In the story Saeng says that she failed the test and was very dissapointed with herself, a feeling heightened by her mother's expectations. The test must have been very important to her for her to be so dissapointed. The author also probably ended with this paragraph to show that Saeng is devoted in passing this test, indicating her resolve despite the setback. Saeng seems like a sentimental yet reliable person, someone who values both personal connections and fulfilling responsibilities. I believe that the test is to spend a minimal amount of money and she wants to earn respect from her mom, proving her ability to manage resources wisely. That is why taking and passing the test seems so important to Saeng, representing more than just a challenge, but a chance to gain her mother's approval. That is why the author ended with that paragraph, highlighting Saeng's determination to try again and ultimately succeed.
1046	9911	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the story with the lines ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The reason that the author concludes the test with these lines is because she is re-establishing the symbolism of the plant. In the text it said that the plant buds in the spring, once it has time to grow and adapt to the new environment. Just as the plant needed that time so did the main character Saeng. She just moved from Vietnam and failed her driver's test. Saeng is very unsure of her new culture. For example she likes bitter melon it says. ""But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself much preferred it to a Big Mac."" She appears to think she is misunderstood and no one likes her, but just as the plant will adapt to this new life so will she, and she will be ready to face the driving test again, symbolizing her own budding confidence and adaptation."
1047	9912	4	3	"The author concludes the story by saying she will take the test again in the spring and until then, vows silently, because the spring reminded Saeng of home. In Vietnam, there were many beautiful wild flowers. After failing her driving test, Saeng goes to the flower shop to get a piece of home and find solace. It said the flower's ""leaves quivering in the wind."" This shows that the plant was not the same as those in Vietnam because there were also no buds. Needing hope after her failure, she is awaiting spring, when the hibiscus will bloom again, that will give Saeng a sense of home, which in turn, will give her the hope to do well on the driving test."
1048	9913	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because for Saeng, her whole world is the plants. Since they are gone, there is no motivation left; the vibrant life she cultivated and nurtured has vanished, leaving her adrift and without purpose, effectively concluding her story as well.
1049	9914	4	3	In the story ìWinter Hibiscus,î the author concludes the story with, ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î The authorís reasoning for saying this is because the presence of memories from Saengís homeland comforts her, so much so that she believes she will pass her test with ease because she will not be nervous. ìit was like walking into another world,î said Saeng, when she entered the florist shop after failing her drivers test. It was almost as if she completely forgot about failing and was only thinking about the plants and flowers. The flowers take her to a happy peace and make her feel at home, like everything is going to be alright. This is why the author concludes with such a sentence because we as readers should understand that these memories of her farmland and the promise of spring will give her the strength and peace of mind needed to pass her driver's test.
1050	9915	4	3	The author likely concluded the story like that because of the title and the beginning of the story. Or he might have concluded the story like that because he wanted to. He could have concluded the story like that to show what might happen. But whether it is a good conclusion is debatable.
1051	9916	4	3	I really do not know why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Possibly because she started to talk, finally breaking the long silence that had defined their interactions and perhaps offering a glimmer of hope for future understanding, leaving the reader to ponder the significance of that single utterance.
1052	9917	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination. Saeng has been through a lot and misses what its like at home, the familiar sights and sounds that comforted her. She feels different and out of place but she is still strong. Life goes on, and this paragraph shows that Saeng will move with it. The paragraph says, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Spring will come, as nothing can stop time. The snow will melt because the weather changes. The geese will fly home and the hibiscus will bloom in spring, a symbol of hope and resilience. Saeng takes a positive look at things and decides to join them. Sure she failed once but she is strong and willing to try again. If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again. Saeng will always have her memories of home but she is willing to change to her new surroundings and adapt. The concluding paragraph shows Saeng’s determination to succeed and survive in the new world, embracing the future with renewed resolve.
1053	9918	4	3	The author concludes the story saying that because she wants to show us that Saeng is confident in herself and will not hesitate to take the test again. She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch, picked up her small shovel, and started to dig a hole in the ground. This action, deliberate and focused, speaks volumes about her resolve; burying her anxieties, she prepares to face the challenge anew.
1054	9919	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph to give a sense of hope and growth. The flower represents Saeng's homeland, and it makes her feel comforted amidst her new surroundings. It connects her with her emotions and reminds her of the way things are back home. The growth and flourishing of the hibiscus corresponds to the flourish of Saeng's own potential. When it blooms, she will have a true piece of home with her, and will be able to take the test again with renewed confidence. The story is ultimately about overcoming obstacles and adjusting to change, finding strength in unexpected places. The visual, and nearly lyrical expression of the blooming hibiscus makes the reward and result of her struggles seem so much more beautiful and attainable.
1055	9920	4	3	"The author concludes this story with hope in this sentence. The beginning was very negative with Saeng failing her drive's test and her mother yelling at her. But when this sentence comes, the reader is filled with hope for the young girl Saeng. The author does this to show that Saeng will adjust and will persevere, whereas before she was so upset when she said, ""I-I failed the test."" Then, for Saeng to rebound from this event, gave the reader hope, and that's why the author did this; it highlights her resilience and suggests a positive outlook despite the initial setback."
1056	9921	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author is talking about how there will be a new start. Since Saeng failed the test, signifying a setback, and in the winter the plant will die, representing the end of a cycle, in the spring the plant will bud again, symbolizing rebirth, and she will retake the test. It's a new chance to start things over, offering hope and the potential for future success.
1057	9922	4	3	Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, Saeng vowed don't really like to talk. Saeng liked to be by herself sometimes. When spring came it was a different story. Saeng loved the spring and being outside. She would play outside all day every day. Saeng was just a nice girl who enjoyed the simple pleasures of the season, finding joy in the warmth and the blooming flowers.
1058	9923	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the character will retry what she failed. In the story the character loves gardening, finding solace and purpose in nurturing life. So, when her favourite plant, which she thought was dead, unexpectedly comes back to life, it symbolizes a renewed hope and determination. This resurgence inspires her to retry and successfully pass her test, mirroring the plant's resilience and offering a fitting and optimistic conclusion.
1059	9924	4	3	The author concludes the story with that because, as winter comes, everything goes away. Like the trees lose their leaves, the geese fly south, and the flowers die off. So, this passage is saying that in the springtime when everything comes back to life, she will start the test again. It is like starting a new life back over, suggesting a cycle of ending and beginning, mirroring nature's rhythm of dormancy and renewal.
1060	9925	4	3	"In the story called ""Winter Hibiscus"" the author concludes the story with this paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, than I will take that test again."" The reason why the author had put that at the end of the story was because when things go under ground everyone wants to wait and wait until it comes back up again because when you fail everything goes down but if you wait awhile than everything will start to raise Just like flowers and everything else that you can think of. Saeng's failed test represents a winter, a period of dormancy. So that is why the author put that at the end of the story cause to tell people that it is ok for people to fail Just as long as you get up and try again until you reach your goal. So that is what the author was talking about and thats why Minfong Ho put that at the end of the story so that people can read and learn for what it says. Ultimately, Ho uses the cyclical imagery of nature and the winter hibiscus to convey a message of hope and resilience, encouraging readers to persevere through setbacks and embrace the opportunity for renewal."
1061	9926	4	3	The author concludes the story with that last paragraph to set the final mood. The author wanted to show that Saeng will not give up and she will continue to adapt to her new surroundings, even when facing challenges. It made the end of the story feel warm and it also inspired hope for the future. The end of the story encourages the reader to not give up as well, regardless of their own circumstances. The last paragraph sets an example of how the reader can vow to improve as well, taking proactive steps toward positive change. The author knew that the last paragraph would stand as an inspiration and maybe help a reader going through something similar to the story, offering a sense of resilience and determination.
1062	9927	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because to her the plant seems to remind her of her homeland which calms her, and when it is budding she feels stronger and more hopeful. In the story Saeng is kind of an outsider, struggling to adjust, and when she sees the plant she sees a tangible piece of her past back home. In the story it says she gets shaky when she tries to say “at home.” When she says “and this hibiscus is budding,” I think it is really saying when she is ready to accept this country as her home, she will blossom as well, because the flower is a reminder of her homeland and her roots. At the end of the story it says how she is getting used to the geese flying in a “V,” so she is gradually becoming more accustomed to this country, suggesting that when she feels truly ready, she will take her test again with renewed confidence.
1063	9928	4	3	"The author includes the paragraph, ""when they come back...then I will take that test again,"" to show that hibiscus is a symbol of time. Saeng uses the hibiscus to measure the amount of time there will be until she takes her test again, observing its growth as a marker. The hibiscus also symbolizes the power to get through struggling (stay strong). Saeng had trouble with her test, but the hibiscus is there to help push her through it to prepare for the next test, offering a visual representation of growth and perseverance. The hibiscus also helps Saeng's mother push through her hard time of seeing her daughter sad from not succeeding on the test, reminding her of hope and resilience. The plant helps the mother try and stay positive and it also helps the mother by trying to do the right thing for her daughter. In the story, the mother decides to plant the hibiscus in the garden to make her daughter happy, showing her support and belief in Saeng's ability to overcome challenges. The hibiscus shows strong symbolism and it helps Saeng and her mother stay strong throughout their struggles, representing hope, time, and the power to persevere."
1064	9929	4	3	This final paragraph goes along with one of the main premises of the story: to not quit and keep going in order to understand and be happy in this world. Saeng is taking this 'test' of sorts to see if she's ready to change and adapt to her new environment, leaving behind the familiar comforts of her past. She failed this time, the overwhelming feelings of displacement still too strong. But when all is right, when she feels more grounded, and the hibiscus is ready to bloom again, signaling a time of renewed hope, she will try again to see if she's ready to truly let go of the old and embrace the new, finally finding happiness in her present reality.
1065	9930	4	3	"She said it because she didn't do what she was suppose to, so she said she failed. Her mother was mad for a second, her brow furrowed with disappointment, but then stopped, her expression softening. She said, ""I love it,"" perhaps finding a silver lining in the effort, and asked if she wanted something to eat. So they went inside, the aroma of dinner wafting out. But she took the task as a test, a challenge to overcome, so she said, ""Next time I will do it right,"" determined to succeed and meet her mother's expectations in the future."
1066	9931	4	3	"I believe the author ended the story with the ""test"" because it is a big part of Saeng's life, a significant custom that shapes her future. It's not merely an event; it's a tradition deeply woven into the fabric of her community and personal identity, representing a rite of passage, which concludes her journey in the narrative. Therefore, ending with the test provides closure and emphasizes the importance of cultural heritage."
1067	9932	4	3	There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First, that ending evokes a lot of emotion, ensuring readers don't find the story uninteresting. Another reason is that it shows strength—not physical, but mental. Saeng is stating that even though she failed the test the first time, she will take it again. Another reason the author may have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to encourage people to never quit. It shows how she failed, and her mom was disappointed, but she is not going to quit and will retake the driver's test. Overall, the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it leaves the reader with a strong message to keep trying and never give up.
1068	9933	4	3	The author most likely concludes the story with this sentence because it shows how dedicated the author and her child are to gardening. I am guessing that the young child’s favorite plant is the hibiscus. I think that the mother and her child’s favorite thing to do together would be gardening. This is a nice way to end a story. It gives the reader kind of a look of question on their faces. It leaves them perhaps curious of why the author did that. But in my opinion I think it adds some curiosity to the story, leaving a pleasant and lingering feeling.
1069	9934	4	3	"The final lines of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" are meant to provide a glimpse into the near future, to show a change in Saeng's attitude. Up until this point Saeng had been lamenting her old country and not adjusting well to her new one. The hibiscus, a symbol of resilience, inspires her and lets her know that the new country has many of the same beautiful things as her old country, offering a sense of connection. ""When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" is a way of saying she's going to let a little time pass, allowing the seasons to change and bring renewal. By taking her driver's test again, she will actively begin her new life, embracing the opportunities her new home offers and moving forward with a renewed sense of hope. Ultimately, this shows her coming to terms with her present situation and actively shaping her future."
1070	9935	4	3	The author concluded the story with saying that Saeng will retake the driving test in the spring to prove a point. When walking home, dejected, from her failed test, Saeng saw a familiar flower growing stubbornly by the sidewalk and impulsively decided to treat herself with a visit to a flower shop. There, surrounded by vibrant colors and scents, she saw many flowers that reminded her of home and the warmth of her native land. She bought a hibiscus, its bright bloom a stark contrast to the muted tones of the late autumn day, and went home. Her and her mother carefully planted it in a pot, after Saeng realized with relief that the flower could be brought inside and make it through the winter. She looked up to see many birds flying overhead, migrating south, and she realized with a start that she, unlike them, has chosen to stay and adapt to her life in @LOCATION1. The hibiscus, a small piece of home transplanted to a new land, has given her the will to survive and she knows she can adapt to life in @LOCATION1. The point the author wanted to get across was that the hibiscus, a symbol of resilience and beauty, gave courage and hope to retake her drivers test and continue surviving, and ultimately thriving, in @LOCATION1.
1071	9936	4	3	The reason I think the author concludes this story with this last paragraph is because this is Saeng's passion. And that Saeng is very patient and will do this every year. She really loves plants and she will wait to do it again next spring. The last paragraph really showed a lot of dedication to her Hibiscus. And she really values the spring and the Hibiscus, highlighting its importance to her.
1072	9937	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this line to show that just like the hibiscus, adapting and struggling to survive and fit in in its non-native land, Saeng will too. She will not give up her fight to pass the test to become a part of her new country. This is supported throughout the story when her mother comments on the hibiscus by the lake. She says, ""It's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters"" (Ho @NUM1). Here the author shows the comparison between the hibiscus' struggle through hard times in a foreign land similarly felt in Saeng's life. Both must be strong and fight through hard times where no one, ""not even her classmates or friends, or Mrs. Lambert"" (Ho @NUM1), understood how alone and out of place she felt. So just as she vows to take the test again, she's promising herself she will fight through the hard times and grow strong, just as her winter hibiscus does, demonstrating her resilience and determination to thrive."
1073	9938	4	3	Primarily why she said that was she was saying with time comes cause. She was basically saying in a while when things change again she believes that her performance could change as well. I depicted this by the idea you can tell that she is beginning to sit over missing her home in Vietnam and that is memory with time change comes along. That is a simple aspect of logic that with time comes chase. I think as much I did properly interpret the aspect of what this is supposed to mean overall, suggesting a cyclical nature to her feelings. But otherwise and finally I believed Saeng said this because time brings change, and this realization ultimately shapes her perspective.
1074	9939	4	3	The importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant. It seems that because the author is not in her native country that she doesn’t have a lot around in this new place that can comfort her. The author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldn’t be able to gives her strength to do anything that she can. It is possible that whatever the challenge @MONTH1 be that the author is trying to get by, the fact that she has some support from the plant gives her the achievement and confidence to complete her task, revealing the enduring power of connection to home and nature in unfamiliar surroundings.
1075	9940	4	3	The author concludes the story with this because the hibiscus and Saeng are very similar in their resilience. Also the narrator compares her to the geese returning south for the winter, then back again. The geese returning represents her starting over at drivers school after failing the test and doing it again with renewed determination. The hibiscus represents her staying strong and vibrant even in the face of adversity, like winter, and then, come spring, she builds up her courage and knowledge and goes and takes the test again. That resilience and determination, mirrored in both the hibiscus and the returning geese, is what the narrator chooses to highlight, ending the story on a note of hope and Saeng's unwavering spirit.
1076	9941	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story like this is possibly for him/her to have a spin off. I mean to me I think that it means she is going to try again when spring comes so her and her plant can have a fresh start, allowing for potential sequels or related stories. This feels like a hopeful note to end on, suggesting renewed effort and a second chance as she anticipates the arrival of spring, and I think that is a good way to end it.
1077	9942	4	3	The author concludes the story with, ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,î for several reasons. One reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the hibiscus flower will be adaptating to spring just like Saeng should to her new environment in the United States, symbolizing her own resilience and growth. Another reason is like the hibiscus budding, Saeng has began to grow older and much wiser of things allowing her to go back in the spring and hopefully pass the driving test, demonstrating her determination. Lastly, in the text it says, ìshe realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quit repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.î This shows Saeng is becoming familiar and at ease now of where she is living just how the hibiscus flower adapts to it's place with ease and gets use to seasons, ultimately suggesting that she too, with time and patience, can flourish in her new home and achieve her goals.
1078	9943	4	3	The author @CAPS1 ends the story with this paragraph because Saeng is saying that when she @CAPS2 comes @CAPS2 back she will take the test over again, which means that, in the form of the test, is that while she was there it was a test of survival, and when the story begins it is the beginning of the test, and at the end of the story is the test and their leaving, and she wants to come back to see what grew. The author is also saying that you don’t know how good you have it, thus completing the narrative arc.
1079	9944	4	3	"Because the Winter hibiscus"" was in the ground how and Saeng tomped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and close -Yes- to Saeng now."
1080	9945	4	3	"The author includes this paragraph in the story because it shows an impression on work ethic and adaption to a new environment can be difficult. ""not even @PERSON1, looked it"" makes something to dislike apparent to a student that is new, which does not give them a good work ethic and that will issue them mentally also. Therefore, the girl is not comfortable and not enthused to working on something that none would appreciate, further highlighting the challenges of adjusting to unfamiliar expectations and feeling unmotivated in a new setting."
1081	9946	4	3	The author concludes with this because she is determined to pass the driving test that she had previously failed. For example, She writes ìshe vowed silently to herself.î When you vow to do something it usually means that you are very determined to do something, suggesting a firm commitment. Everything else that she says after that she really means it, highlighting the sincerity behind her intentions. Therefore, that is why the author concludes with this sentence, in order to show her devotion to her goal and emphasizing the resolution she has found.
1082	9947	4	3	"The author of the story, Winter Hibiscus, concluded the story with that paragraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng is finally going to start getting used to her new home. She won’t spend so much time dreaming about her past. The greenhouse, filled with life and reminiscent of her homeland's warmth, likely triggered a release. ""And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept."" I believe that's what she needed to get on with her life; the cathartic weeping allowed her to grieve for what she left behind and begin to embrace her present and future."
1083	9948	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to let us know when she'll take it again. When the season changes is when she will take it again. Saeng is probably embarrassed, which is why she wants to wait so long. Saeng took a long walk home and stopped at the flower shop. She tried getting her mind off failing the test. Saeng bought a nice flower/plant for @MONEY1. Her mother was upset at first, then realized her daughter wasn't happy and changed her mood, showing empathy for Saeng's disappointment and offering unspoken support.
1084	9949	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with this because he is saying that she will keep trying and will not give up and will keep on trying. I say this because she just moved to America from Vietnam and is having a hard time adjusting to life in America. She is working hard to learn English and navigate a new culture, facing challenges with transportation and feeling a sense of displacement. I think the geese represent something that is always changing their surroundings and when they come she is going to fly again to get her license, symbolizing her renewed determination to adapt and succeed in her new home.
1085	9950	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because now she has something to work for, giving her a renewed sense of purpose. The author could have also concluded the story with this paragraph because she must wait that long until she can take it again, highlighting the theme of patience. Also, Saeng could want to wait to see the plant grow and get bigger and stronger, showing the value she places on nurturing and growth, which ultimately provides a hopeful and forward-looking end.
1086	9951	4	3	Saeng would silently in spring; she will take the test again. In the good ending to this story, it was as good as it ended because the story had listed some of malance, ready and spring it, and of the plant, a beautiful time, the spring, all as plant ending, because spring is near. Trying and for the take the test again of that time, to think it's a good ending because the ruler strong are about machines, Saeng and spring it and makes is near paragraph. That is why it is a good ending plant to the stays, making it clear that the season and Saeng's perseverance led to a positive resolution.
1087	9952	4	3	The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus means to Saeng. To her it is a symbol of strength and comfort, representing resilience. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter, she knows that she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive the challenges she faces. She is also going to take the test again when the hibiscuses are budding since it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding, connecting her to happier memories. I also think the author concludes the story this way, because both the plant and Saeng are going to have to overcome obstacles. The plant must survive the winter and come back in the spring, reborn and renewed. While Saeng must pass her driverís test, a symbolic step towards independence. Finally I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng: hope. If it survives she knows that she too will survive, and life goes on, filled with the possibility of growth and renewal.
1088	9953	4	3	"I believe the author concluded the story with “When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the gesse return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” because it shows the entire theme of the story. The theme of this story is adjusting to things in life. The conclusion demonstrates this when she says she will take the test again, showing resilience. The hibiscus allowed her to get over the changes in life. For example, “The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long grey hair."" The hibiscus was something familiar from home that gave her good memories, helping her cope with the new environment. The hibiscus encouraged her to accept her new life and keep trying to make it better, providing her with a sense of hope and determination to face future challenges."
1089	9954	4	3	The author most likely concludes the story that way because that is the time that Saeng feels most comfortable. Saeng and her mom moved from Vietnam, where the winter Hibiscus are popular and familiar to Saeng. She ends the text in this manner because it reminds Saeng about Vietnam and how she feels better during that time of year, providing a sense of solace. When she says, “And beside it was yet another old friend,” she feels as if this plant is a friend to her, offering a connection to her past and making her feel more comfortable in her new environment. This emphasis on comfort and familiarity is why the author ended the story in the manner that she did.
1090	9955	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this saying because it will be a fresh start, and it will be spring and beautiful. ""Plant it right now"" is telling me that she wants another try. She wants a fresh start, and come spring, when all of her pretty flowers are blooming and getting their chance, she wants her own chance to pass. The phrase suggests urgency and hope, emphasizing the importance of seizing the present moment to cultivate a better future for herself. Ultimately, the saying encapsulates the story's theme of renewal and the character's desire for a second chance at happiness."
1091	9956	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of her sadness for what she did. The test she was telling about was how she was supposed to use the twenty dollars they had and buying one item. Big mistake that she spent most of the money buying a plant, which reminded her of home, besides what was needed for the item; and this last paragraph is saying that when she has the chance to do the ""test"" again, she will do what she is supposed to do, indicating a resolve to act more responsibly in the future."
1092	9957	4	3	After reading “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I believe Ho ended the story with that paragraph to support her idea of overcoming obstacles. First, after failing her driving test, Saeng was very upset and didn’t know if she would ever pass it. But after seeing a hibiscus plant at the greenhouse, its vibrant color and resilience reminded her of her home in Vietnam and the strength she possessed, which inspired her. Second, when she bought the plant, her mother was a little angry because it was expensive and seemed frivolous given their limited resources. But, after seeing how the plant brought joy to Saeng and connected her to her roots, her mother understood its importance and forgave her. Last, when Saeng was digging a hole in the frozen ground to let the hibiscus grow, facing the physical challenge and cold weather, it inspired Saeng to take the test again because she overcame the obstacles of bringing the plant home and ensuring its survival, realizing she too could persevere. Therefore, I believe Ho ended “Winter Hibiscus” in this way to emphasize her idea of overcoming obstacles through resilience and connection to one’s heritage.
1093	9958	4	3	"The last paragraph of the story displays the theme of determination. The Hibiscus reminded her that her ""home"" was her old life, but misses @CAPS1 in her new life. She gains determination through the reminder of this. She soon realizes that she is home, for things have come familiar to her, such as the V formation of the geese overhead, a sight that now brings comfort instead of longing. She loved her old home, but she realized it was time to move on and build a fulfilling existence where she is. The last paragraph does not only mean retaking a driving test; it symbolizes the determination to embrace her new home and life, suggesting a renewed commitment to establishing roots and finding happiness in her present circumstances."
1094	9959	4	3	I will take that test again. She has unwavering confidence from the hibiscus and snow. When the snow melts and hibiscus buds bloom, then she will go again, kind of growing with the hibiscus, so and in all she is determined to have enough confidence for the test.
1095	9960	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they want people to know what happened in the story, summarizing the events for clarity. Also because they want people to know what it might mean or say in relation to the story, offering a layer of interpretation. The sentence means that when spring comes and when the snow might melt the plants will be out and budding, symbolizing renewal and hope, but by next class or next school year he will come out and be brave and take the test all over again, demonstrating resilience. That is what the sentence means of the story and how it might be compared to both things in different ways, highlighting the cyclical nature of challenges and the potential for future growth.
1096	9961	4	3	The final paragraph in “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho reads, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently, to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This paragraph compares her to the flowers, which shows that she is resilient like the flower; as the hibiscus is strong enough to bud again after winter, so too is Saeng determined to take the test again next year and pass it. She would also take the test because it is comforting to her and reminds her of home, connecting her to a sense of familiarity and hope in a new and challenging environment, reinforcing her resolve.
1097	9962	4	3	"He ended the paragraph like that because he may want you to read on, or it could be that he is showing you the comparison between the flower and Saeng. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The quote is showing the flower can fight through the winter and come back. Saeng failed the test once and is now going back to retake the test, which shows that they both have motivation and the integrity to come back, further emphasizing the author’s potential intent to draw a parallel between Saeng's resilience and the flower's perseverance."
1098	9963	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, ìWhen they com back, Saeng vowed silently to hersef, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, Then I will take that test againî. I believe the author concluded the story like this because it shows that the hibiscus represented to Saeng a new beginning and a chance to restart after her failure. The return of spring, signaled by the melting snows, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus, mirrors Saeng's own potential for renewal. When Saeng saw the hibiscus after failing her driving test, it gave her comfort in a time of disappointment, connection to her past experiences, and the belief that she could overcome her obstacles. Therefore, when the narrator says, ìwhen the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", this imagery implies a fresh start, suggesting the hibiscus is not just a plant, but a symbol representing Saeng's resilience and determination to try again. This symbolic connection solidifies why the author concludes the story with this hopeful and forward-looking paragraph, emphasizing Saeng's renewed resolve."
1099	9964	4	3	The last line is included in the story “Winter Hibiscus” because it showed the connection between Saeng and the flower. Even though Saeng failed the driving test the first time, she decides to take it again in the spring. The hibiscus flower, like Saeng, is out of place and will have to make it through the winter into the spring so it can bud again. This shows how, like the flower, Saeng will bud again in the spring by retaking the driving test. Another reason is that Saeng and the flower are not used to the conditions in @LOCATION1. So they both have to weather the winter months they are not used to, as Saeng adjusts to a new country and the flower to an unfamiliar climate. This shows again how the last line connects the girl and the flower together, emphasizing their shared resilience. In conclusion, the last line is used in the text to wrap up the story with a connection between the flower and Saeng, highlighting their parallel journeys of adaptation and eventual flourishing.
1100	9965	4	3	"I think the author concludes the story with this statement because the author is determined to get used to the new country and surroundings. In the story, the author is showing homesickness. The author sees a plant that is known where she comes from and buys it for over @NUM1; her mother couldn't believe it. She didn't want to tell her mother exactly why she got it because she was too shaky to say ""home"" or start crying again. The last sentence is showing that the author is trying to adapt and find a piece of familiarity in this unfamiliar place, signaling a willingness to embrace her new life despite the pangs of nostalgia."
1101	9966	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph because she/he wanted to close the story with a conclusion that portrays the story. The author talked about the hibiscus in the story as a ìcomfort in time of distressî a hobby or thing she likes doing with her spare time. In conclusion the author concludes with that paragraph for the reasons stated in the preceding text, emphasizing the hibiscus as a symbol of solace and personal enjoyment, effectively encapsulating the narrative's core themes.
1102	9967	4	3	The author ends the story with the given paragraph to get across that Saeng will recover and try again. It highlights the things important and familiar to Saeng that gave her comfort, and uses them to essentially say that she’ll take the test over again once she feels better. The winter hibiscus was a plant that Saeng remembered of life back home up to the story, so when she saw the plant, “a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” Saeng was unable to comfort her emotions when she first saw the plant because she realized how much she missed her old life. The plant is mentioned in the final paragraph because when it blooms in the spring, the winter hibiscus will help fill the emotional void, and help Saeng to try to take the test again. She also mentions the geese for the same reason, but in a different way. Unlike the winter hibiscus, it took a while for the geese to become, “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Saeng mentions this so that she can get used to the strange and unfamiliar parts of her life, and to come to grips with her failed test. Therefore by mentioning the things she does in the last paragraph, Saeng uses familiar objects, foreign and domestic, to illustrate her coming to grips with her failure, suggesting a resilience and determination to face future challenges.
1103	9968	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it expresses the meaning of the story. Life continues no matter what, the hibiscus will return again in the spring. The hibiscus is like a symbol to Saeng's life. The plant normally doesn't survive in winter months, but this one did. The mother says, ""It's flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the winter months here..."" Saeng and her mother are just like the plant, resilient and determined. They are strong and their lives will continue even though they are in a new environment, facing unfamiliar challenges and adapting to a different world. The author chose to end the story with that paragraph because even though she says the hibiscus will come back every spring the deeper meaning is that Saeng and her mother, like the hibiscus, will continue to live their lives, demonstrating a quiet strength and an enduring hope for the future."
1104	9969	4	3	"The author chooses to end the story in a very deep, connected way. It is ended on a note of rebirth and second chances. When Saeng vows, ""When they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, when the Hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again,"" the author is connecting a sense of a new country and second chances and rebirth. Spring and snow melting could be connected to rebirth, while the geese returning could symbolize a second chance, as geese often migrate back to where they started. This is connected to Saeng's second chance at not only the test but also life in a new place. The author also shows that Saeng is getting used to the new country, which shows a sense of hope; seeing the familiar signs of spring allows her to feel more at home, and this shows that there is some hope for her test and her future."
1105	9970	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to get the moral of the story. I said this idea because in the story he talks about orchids, lanno bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. It talks about how these flowers surrounded her, seemingly to test her resolve or perhaps symbolize the beautiful but potentially challenging aspects of life she was navigating. The author uses the imagery of the garden to highlight the central theme, suggesting the conclusion serves to solidify this message and leave the reader contemplating the deeper meaning behind her experiences.
1106	9971	4	3	I think the Author concludes this in the story because it is key information for this story. Because it is dealing with her mom, she loves to work on the garden and become a gardener, and have a real job like her mom, showing how deeply connected she feels to her mother's passions and aspirations.
1107	9972	4	3	Saeng thinks that she has failed because she misses her grandmother. The hibiscus plant that she buys reminds her of grandmother’s scent. Saeng spent over @MONEY1 on the hibiscus plant. She needed it to feel a little bit more at home in this new place. Saeng feels she had very little time to leave her country, in “a blink.” Her grandmother would want her to be strong and not cry at the thought of being away from her. Saeng needs to think of the good and smile when she is reminded of her past. Saeng wants to pass the test; she will remind herself of her grandmother's strength. Next time the hibiscus are budding she must not cry, and she will honor her memory by facing the future with courage.
1108	9973	4	3	The reason I think that the author did it is because they wanted you to know what time it took place and what the weather was like. It also tells you how long she is going to wait, like until the snow melts, and that is going to be a while. Furthermore, the description includes when the geese live and when they will return home, providing context to her timeframe and intentions, so this is why I think she tells you what it is like, to ground the narrative and set the stage for the events to follow.
1109	9974	4	3	I think that this is about winter hibiscus and hedpe tall and lush bad surrounded their garden. Its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers, She said when she got to the hibiscus she reached out and touched a petal gently. The winter hibiscus, despite its name, thrived, and the hedpe, a tall and lush bed, offered a vibrant backdrop to their garden. Its lush green leaves were dotted with vermilion flowers. She said when she got to the hibiscus she reached out and touched a petal gently, marveling at its delicate texture, concluding her appreciation of its simple beauty.
1110	9975	4	3	The reason that the author had ended the story the way she did was to leave the reader on the last thought. Also it symbolizes rebirth. When Saeng says, ì... this hibiscus is budding ...î (Ho @NUM1). She is also describing that they will start over when spring comes. And that leaves the reader with the last thought about Saeng, and how she has overcome living in the new place. Lastly, it ties up Saeng's feelings and experiences the whole time she had moved, ì... I will take the test againî (Ho @NUM1), which tells the reader she will continue to give her new home a shot. In conclusion, the reason for this quote being the last paragraph is to show that Saeng will continue to try to overcome adversity.
1111	9976	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants there to be hope for the future, seeing that the hibiscus budding in the spring is what Saeng is waiting for. It gives her hope that she will be able to pass that test again. This is shown when she says ""...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" All through the winter, Saeng hopes she will improve, and when the hibiscus buds, she will know that it is time to try again. Saeng sees the spring as a new beginning, so that means it is a time to overcome her obstacle. I think that obstacle or test might be to not cry when she thinks about her old life in Vietnam. When she accomplishes this, she is growing just like the hibiscus, signifying her personal growth and ability to face the future with renewed strength."
1112	9977	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for one main reason: to leave the reader with a lingering sense of ambiguity. This uncertainty mirrors the protagonist's own unresolved feelings and questions about the events that transpired. The final paragraph, therefore, doesn't offer neat resolutions or definitive answers, but rather reinforces the complexities of human experience. This concluding choice allows the reader to continue pondering the themes of the story long after finishing it, solidifying the narrative's impact.
1113	9978	4	3	The author is showing that Saeng wants to keep on with her mother's gardening, continuing to cultivate the familiar rows of vegetables and fragrant herbs. To take over an elder's traditions and what her mother started means more than just tending plants; it represents a desire to honor her memory. In essence, Saeng's commitment ensures the garden's continuation, symbolizing the enduring connection between mother and daughter.
1114	9979	4	3	I believe that the author ended the story with this paragraph to show the persistence of the main character. I believe this because in the beginning of the story when she is walking home, she states that she failed the driver's test. This initial setback highlights her disappointment. In the last paragraph, she states that after winter is over she will take the test again when her hibiscus blooms, symbolizing a renewed hope and determination. Her persistence allows her to push through life as if she was a plant trying to survive the winter, waiting for the right season to flourish, and ultimately demonstrating her resilience.
1115	9980	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because she wants to do it right next time, suggesting a sense of hope and determination. What it's saying is that she can try every year to get it right to impress her mother and perhaps achieve a deeper understanding or connection. In conclusion, this cyclical pursuit reveals a continuous effort to improve and strengthen their relationship.
1116	9981	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flower; to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng, the Winter Hibiscus is like story books, waiting to be read; simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her “gentle grandmother” from her first home. The author is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forget who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the assumption as to why the author ended the story “Winter Hibiscus” with the paragraph selected, emphasizing the importance of remembering one’s roots while navigating a new life.
1117	9982	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. For example, it shows a sense of hope, when she says “this hibiscus is budding"". That indicates a new beginning or starting over. I think that is the idea the author is trying to get across. Obviously it was difficult for the author to adjust to her new country. For example, she was disappointed that the hibiscus wasn’t the same as the one in her homeland. Even though she's feeling nostalgic, this paragraph reassures the reader that the author is willing to give her new country another chance, suggesting an acceptance of change and a willingness to embrace the future."
1118	9983	4	3	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that “when they come back ... I will take the test again,” (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and, essentially, the strength to take the test over again. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept ”(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. The flowers represent a connection to her past and a source of resilience for her future, allowing her to envision a renewed attempt at the driving test. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character.
1119	9984	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show she loved them flowers. That they meant a whole lot to her. When she failed her driving test she was sad, and the flowers made her feel better. Now that the snow is falling, she waits until spring; that's when they come up, and she will have faith and take the test again, knowing they will bloom anew.
1120	9985	4	3	The author concluded this sentence because he was letting everyone know that Saeng would return to the hibiscus and take care of it still, showing her continued dedication, and that she has not forgotten about it despite any intervening circumstances.
1121	9986	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", by Minfong Ho, a teenager, Saeng, moves from Vietnam to the United states. She later takes a drivers test, but does not succeed in passing, but does succeed in finding comfort from her memories of her homeland. The last paragraph states ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. These being that Saeng was very upset about failing her test and was reminded of her homeland and the changes she's had to adapt to during this move. The hibiscus plant gives Saeng a hope to continue her journey even when things get very hard. Saeng sees the plant as a symbol of her own resilience, its ability to survive the harsh winter mirroring her own struggle to adapt. The winter is this plant's time of trouble and sadness, as Saeng's time of trouble and sadness is failing this test and not being at her real home. The end of winter gives both the plant and Saeng a chance to start over and a renewed hope to start over; Saeng will find it easy to get through hardships if she continues to find comfort from her past. Ultimately, the hibiscus becomes a symbol of hope and perseverance, suggesting that Saeng, like the plant, will bloom again in a new environment."
1122	9987	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to get the readers wondering about the future and what might happen next. To show that she's not going to give up on what she wants to do, despite the obstacles she has faced and the uncertainties that lie ahead, leaving a lasting impression.
1123	9988	4	3	The author Minfong Ho ends the story talking about the test Saeng failed and vowing to take it again because, like in the story, the test was symbolizing slightly moving on, just kind of starting her new life and not living in the old. But Saeng couldn't do that immediately. She bought the flower with all her money because it held memories for her, memories of her homeland and the life she left behind. But I think as the story goes on, especially after her interaction with the flower seller, she kind of realizes she can have both, her old and new life, preserving her past while embracing the future. I think she ends the story that way because she really does want to try again; the determination in her vow is palpable. She wants to be able to please her mom, and herself; she wants to be able to move on and start her new life, accepting the challenge this new beginning presents. Ultimately, Saeng's decision to retake the test suggests a willingness to integrate her past with her future, indicating a hopeful path forward.
1124	9989	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng relates that she needs more time. If she takes a break and does what she needs to, then she will be able to pass the test, demonstrating her potential with focused effort.
1125	9990	4	3	The author chose to conclude the story this way because he can now expand on this story, creating a sequel about Saengís success. Also, by ending the story this way, the author is showing there is no limit to what Saeng is willing to do and that she will stop at nothing until her test is complete. Saeng is having difficulties adapting to her new lifestyle because the plants and the previous luxuries that she had are no longer present in her life. In the story, Saengís determination is strongly shown when her mother finds out that she spent @NUM1 dollars to have a similar plant. The mother responds by saying their whole garden is worth less than @NUM1 dollars, highlighting the vast difference in their current circumstances and reinforcing Saeng’s unwavering commitment to recreating her past comforts, suggesting a promising narrative arc for future installments.
1126	9991	4	3	This sentence concludes the passage, to show how when the hibiscus is budding and a new season starts, Saeng will be a new person and will be able to take the test. In this sentence the cold snow, fleeing geese and planted hibiscus can all represent Saeng and what she is going through. They are either cold, ready to leave or restricted just like Saeng feels, symbolizing her current state. But, when a new season starts, the geese come back, and the hibiscus is no longer restricted in a pot, Saeng will also grow up and be able to take the test, signifying her anticipated transformation. This sentence is put at the end to show how much Saeng can now grow because she has the hibiscus, which is growing with her, suggesting a parallel journey of growth and liberation for both.
1127	9992	4	3	The author ends the story with the sentence provided because, as she was saying that when you and winter are over, there will be time again to get the gardening back to the test with the plant she had planted, signifying a hopeful outlook for renewal and the return of life after a period of dormancy.
1128	9993	4	3	The author has concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking the test again another time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng wanted to take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, marking the arrival of spring. She feels ready when that time comes around, feeling more prepared with the change of seasons. Saeng is trying to say to herself that she needs more time to be ready for this test and the pressure it brings. When she gets more time to be ready for the test, she will take the test again. I think that is why the author wrote the paragraph as a conclusion, leaving the reader with a sense of hope for Saeng's future attempt.
1129	9994	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Because when the hibiscus started budding it will give her inspiration to try and past the test again. In order to past the test she wanted to feel like she was home, and to have memories of her home to encourage her to try again. Therefore, this is the reason the author concludes the story with the last paragraph, emphasizing the hibiscus as a symbol of hope and a connection to her past, providing the necessary motivation for her future attempts.
1130	9995	4	3	The author concludes the story with a paragraph taking the test again to show that the narrator might be upset about being in a new place but she will keep trying. The narrator gets upset when she knows the hibiscus is not like the one's from her old home. This upsets her because she probably misses things that she was used to before. The author uses that paragraph to show the narrator is strong and wonít give up on making things the way they were but also showing that she'll try to adapt to her new home. The author does this to show that you should keep trying at something that you love. The narrator will keep trying when the geese fly back and the hibiscus is budding, illustrating her dedication to her passions. So the author is saying try if you fail and set goals to never give up, ultimately showing the importance of resilience.
1131	9996	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. It serves as a final reflection on the events that have transpired, offering a sense of closure. The paragraph encapsulates the central themes explored throughout the narrative, providing a concise restatement of the story's core message and leaving the reader with a lasting impression of its significance. Ultimately, it solidifies the story's overall impact and reinforces its intended meaning, thus bringing a satisfying resolution to the narrative journey.
1132	9997	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows that he messed up on the test, and he's saying when spring comes back around, he will be ready to take the test. I know it is spring because he said when the snow melts, implying the end of winter and the hope for a fresh start with improved preparation.
1133	9998	4	3	When she moved to America she saw all the beautiful flowers that were out in the spring. She saw a blossom that caught her attention; it was called hibiscus. She felt connected with it that she went to the florist to see if they had it. Back where she came from, they grew wild, jittering out from the cracks in ceizors walls. The blossom reminded her of her grandmother, its long, delicate petals like her long gray hair, freshly washed.
1134	9999	4	3	In the passage “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the quote “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again,” symbolizes a new journey in the new country she lives in. In the test Saeng is having a personal discrepancy, missing her homeland as she states “I failed the test.” This test meant more to her than just failing; it was a test to her ability to function in her new country, and she felt she failed. The “when they came back…” quote started above can be analyzed deeply, as the snow being her obstacles and the hibiscus being herself. When the obstacles melt away and she buds into a new, stronger person, she will take the test again. This demonstrates Saeng's resilience and determination to adapt and succeed in her new environment, viewing the test as a personal challenge to overcome rather than a definitive failure.
1135	10000	4	3	She will go back to where she started, her journey complete. It's a circle, a seasonal return, and she will be back the next year where she began, ready to start anew.
1136	10001	4	3	Original Text:  The study of media effects is a complex field. Researchers use various methods to explore how media influences individuals and society. These methods range from surveys to experiments. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses. Understanding these methodologies is crucial for interpreting research findings.  Expanded Text:  The study of media effects represents a complex and multifaceted field of inquiry. Researchers employ a diverse array of methodologies to explore the intricate ways in which media influences both individuals and broader societal structures. These methods span a considerable range, encompassing approaches as varied as large-scale surveys designed to capture broad trends and controlled laboratory experiments aimed at isolating specific causal relationships. Each methodological approach possesses its own inherent strengths and weaknesses, impacting the type of data collected and the conclusions that can be drawn. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of these methodologies is absolutely crucial for accurately interpreting research findings and evaluating the validity of claims made about media influence, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the media's role in shaping our world.
1137	10002	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph, ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,î because that flower budding would make her feel confident about everything. The reason I think this is because that flower reminds her of past time memories of her homeland. Itís basically like she has a little peice of home in her new home. An example that represents this is, ìNot like the kind we had before,î this is explaining the new hibiscus is similar, but not the same as the one from home, so this reminds her of home. The hibiscus blooming serves as a symbol of hope and resilience, connecting her to her roots and providing the emotional strength needed to face the challenge again, which is why I believe the author ends the story the way they do.
1138	10003	4	3	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to show that Saeng is not just going to give up; she is going to overcome the problem. This is a great way to end this story because the entire story is about overcoming problems, and if Saeng just gave up it would ruin the story’s message of resilience. Just like she was able to move away from her homeland, she will eventually pass the test. The mother was also able to overcome obstacles, such as moving away from her homeland and having to plant all new plants, showing her own adaptability. She obviously misses the old plants, which you can tell by the way she knew what her gift was. But she is able to deal with that, demonstrating her strength, just like Saeng will do on her test the next time, proving that she too possesses that same strength.
1139	10004	4	3	Everything in the story is about to change. The winter will change to spring, the snow will melt and vanish, the geese will return, the hibiscus will bud, Saeng will also change and mature as well. Saeng is just like the hibiscus plant, as the plant is out of place on the road, Saeng is out of place in the new country and she must adapt like the hibiscus plant. The plant looks different in the United States than in Vietnam because it matured and grew, acclimating to its new environment. That is what Saeng must do; she must mature and grow in this new country, embracing the opportunities for change. For example, Saeng observed how different the plant looked in the shop window then it did in her home country, its leaves a deeper green, its blooms more vibrant. She was observing herself and how different she appeared as well, a reflection of her own adaptation. The reason for putting the paragraph at the very end was to show that she had matured already, placing it at the end to show that she had grown and learned. Putting it at the beginning would not give the same effect, the transformation needs to be revealed gradually. The hibiscus plant was able to sustain the harsh winters change. Saeng is able to do that as well, drawing strength from the plant's resilience, and she made the silent vow to take that test again when she has matured, just as the things around her have, demonstrating her commitment to growth and her new life.
1140	10005	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph shown for several reasons. First, the author needs to conclude the story without leaving any questions in the readers mind as to what happens. This is achieved by incorporating the geese, hibiscus, and her driver's test into the last paragraph, providing a sense of closure. Next, this last paragraph adds a theme of perseverance to the story, highlighting her determination. The main character is driven to take the driver's test again through memories of Vietnam, showing her resilience. Lastly, it adds to the character by saying that she will ""take that test again""; she is shown as being realistic and not overconfident, suggesting a grounded approach to future challenges. These are some of the ways that the last paragraph enhances the story, providing a satisfying resolution while reinforcing key themes and character traits."
1141	10006	4	3	The author chose to end the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is starting to adjust to her new home and that she will not give up. You can tell that she still misses her homeland by her reaction to seeing the hibiscus plant, a vibrant reminder of her past, but also that she is growing accustomed to her new home because of how she recognizes the geese overhead. This connection to the natural world around her, specifically how she will make the decision of when to retake the driving test based on their migration patterns, suggests a growing sense of belonging and determination to build a life in this new place, indicating she is finding her footing.
1142	10007	4	3	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng was not prepared for this test, likely due to being unaccustomed to the unfamiliar environment of the testing location. However, after seeing the familiar plants that reminded her of home, and knowing that springtime is a season of renewal when more will blossom, she will likely feel more confident and ready to take the test over, suggesting a hopeful outlook for her future success.
1143	10008	4	3	The reasoning for concluding this story this way is to state that the season of the flowers is over and is to be held off until the spring, offering a natural point to pause the narrative. This allows the author to end the story gracefully, creating anticipation for the flowers' return in the spring, when a new story, perhaps building upon the themes or characters introduced, can begin. In conclusion, this cyclical ending provides closure while simultaneously hinting at future possibilities, making it a fitting choice for the author's final paragraph.
1144	10009	4	3	"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". To show that Saeng is going to take the test again and is not going to give up. This is shown by saying, ""then I will take that test again"". This shows that she has not given up and wants to try again, her determination fueled by the cyclical promise of renewal that spring embodies. The return of the geese and the blooming hibiscus serve as personal symbols of hope and perseverance, reinforcing her commitment to future success."
1145	10010	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of how it related to when Saeng failed her driving test. But she was determined to take it over when she feels she's ready, and the paragraph said ""in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again."" This cyclical imagery emphasizes Saeng’s renewed hope and resolve, linking her personal journey to the natural world's rhythms of renewal. The hibiscus budding specifically symbolizes her own potential and growth, suggesting a future attempt rooted in patience and self-belief."
1146	10011	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” which was written by Minfong Ho, I believe she put it there because it keeps you asking questions. The story leaves you wondering about the unspoken tensions. I think because her mom was so disappointed with her, as suggested by the mother's critical remarks about her English, that maybe she can change things and make things better. The hibiscus becomes a symbol of hope and a reminder of their heritage. Ultimately, the ambiguity encourages readers to reflect on the complexities of mother-daughter relationships and the challenges of cultural adaptation.
1147	10012	4	3	The author ends the story by saying ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.î she chooses to end like this to show the change of the mood throughout the story. When she gets home her mother ìnoticed the tear staie on her daughterís cheeks and her puffy eyes.î Saeng felt sad and out of place in the beginning of the story, clearly disappointed by her performance. But by the end she felt happy and optimistic, already looking forward to the spring and another chance to prove herself.
1148	10013	4	3	"I think the author concludes the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph for these reasons. The first reason is to show that the girl won't give up. She was crying in the store and just very depressed, missing her home. But, she knows that she has to keep going and adapt to her new life. It shows a sense of determination to make the best of the situation. Another reason why I think the author made this the last paragraph is this: it showed her getting used to her environment. I think the author used what she remembers about her country and what she now knows of the new country and puts them together. That way she gets hope from both the familiar and the new. For example, in the article it says, “many of the things she had thought of as strange before, had become… almost familiar to her now.” This shows that she is realizing that she is used to the arrangement right now, finding a sense of normalcy. So she then gets hope from it, blending her past and present. Also, I think the author did that so that it would add a positive effect on the story, leaving the reader with a feeling of optimism for the girl's future. That is why I think the author wrote that as the last paragraph, creating a hopeful ending."
1149	10014	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show people that the story or people in the story have a thing for nature, or like writing about nature, like what's in nature, the changes, or maybe this story is about nature at its best, highlighting its beauty and power as it shapes the characters' experiences and reflections.
1150	10015	4	3	The author wrote that last paragraph to give hope to Saeng and the reader. After seeing the hibiscus flower, Saeng is reminded of her old country and feels sad; the author writes, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” Saeng buys the flower and talks with her mum about it at home. The flower reminds her of home but it also gives her inspiration. That is why she says she will pass the test when the hibiscus buds bloom, demonstrating her renewed optimism and determination to succeed in her new life.
1151	10016	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph because it fits along with a lot of the story and sums it up well. In the story the hibiscus means a lot to Saeng. During the story she relates a lot of memories to the hibiscus. It reminds her of her home and her past so it plays an important role; it's a symbol of hope and perseverance for her. When she is planting it, it's winter and the hibiscus hasn't bloomed yet. So by saying that she will take the test again when it is budding is like saying she will take the test again when it's budding again, symbolizing a new beginning. She is pretty much acting the same as the flower, waiting for her own time to bloom once again, showing its importance. And that's why I think the author ended with that paragraph, connecting Saeng's personal growth to the natural cycle of the hibiscus.
1152	10017	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it’s saying that she can’t work in the garden in winter, but “when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding,” are all signs of spring. In the spring, she will take the test again; which implies that she will work in the garden, tending to the plants and enjoying the renewed life around her.
1153	10018	4	3	"The author concludes the story like this: the Author (Minfong Ho) is telling you what will happen in spring time. I think this means, as the text says, Saeng vowed silently to herself, ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This means that in spring the hibiscus will be budding, signifying a time of renewal and hope for Saeng to retake the test."
1154	10019	4	3	because she thinks she will do better in the spring for some reason I dont know if I should agree because she will be in a better mood then and it will look more like her home place.
1155	10020	4	3	The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph because it symbolizes Saeng's decision to try again. Things in nature are repetitive; seasons change but eventually they appear again, geese migrate but they too return, and the author used this as a comparison to Saeng's decision to try for her license again, illustrating the cyclical nature of perseverance. Just like Saeng, the winter hibiscus was out of its normal environment but was learning to adapt, drawing strength from an unlikely place. That inspired Saeng to keep trying even if she failed, because the hibiscus was trying to survive the winter even though it was out of place, demonstrating a resilience that mirrored her own journey and ultimately, her choice to not give up.
1156	10021	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because no matter what she said or did, she had to get the flower because it reminds her of where she used to live and how it was there, so she started to cry. The test, it seems, was not to buy the flower and not to cry, showing her emotional connection to her past. The ending suggests hope, indicating that in the spring she is going to grow her own flower, symbolizing a fresh start and the ability to create her own memories, which completes what I think the test is about.
1157	10022	4	3	She will see if her plant will survive through the winter, just like the ones back at home, in her familiar garden. And she thinks things will be the same here as they were there, hoping for a seamless transition for her beloved plant.
1158	10023	4	3	It's the start of a new life. She has a new school and a new plant, a hibiscus. It is like she has a connection to the plant; when it grows, she grows stronger and more confident. Watering it each morning became a ritual, a silent promise to nurture both the plant and herself. That's when she said, when they come back when the hibiscus is budding, she will be ready for that test. This marked a deadline, a tangible goal intertwined with the plant's progress, giving her the time to prepare and the confidence to face whatever challenges lay ahead.
1159	10024	4	3	The author ends it with that because it shows that she won’t give up and that she will give her new country a chance, despite any hardships she may face. She ends it with that to say that she will be strong like the flower, resilient and capable of thriving even in difficult conditions, and that she will stay no matter what! That she will be there, in that spot to see it grow back, symbolizing her hope for a brighter future in this new land. That's why I think she concluded with that powerful image.
1160	10025	4	3	Throughout this story we are given background information on a girl who deferentially misses her true home; when we are first introduced to young Saeng she is in a florist’s shop simply looking at flowers. We soon learn that she is not only looking at flowers but looking at pieces of her home and past; she then purchases a hibiscus, which is a flower native to her Vietnam. After discovering that she has just failed a test, it becomes more apparent that buying the flower is a way to cope with her new situation in America and feel comforted by her past. The author is able to conclude the story with that statement because it speaks of moving forward without clinging to the past; in the spring, Saeng will have a new home and find strength in her past, that is what I feel the final paragraph suggests.
1161	10026	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is determined to pass the test. She knows when it's spring and the hibiscus is budding, she will retake the test. I think she wants to retake the test because the hibiscus makes her think about her homeland. It makes her feel more confident. She thinks she can pass it next time. The hibiscus makes her happy and overwhelmed, reminding her of familiar beauty and strength. She wants to retake the test, fueled by this renewed connection to her roots. She's sure she will do better next time, carrying the spirit of her homeland with her.
1162	10027	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that if that type of flower could bloom in different places and go through natural changes, adapting to new environments, then so can she. To me, the flower is a symbol to the author that encourages her to keep trying and persevering through challenges. No matter if you have to start all over and doing it again, it’s just this time you will know and would have learned from the past mistakes, making you stronger. Just as a flower blooms one spring, it dies in the winter, and then comes again in the spring, representing resilience and renewal. That’s the same as Saeng failing that test that year; she can go back next time and take it again, armed with experience and determination to succeed.
1163	10028	4	3	"Guess that she is saying that when winter is gone she will be prepared for that winter's test again. I guess this because they were not prepared for the winter to come, evidenced by their late-season planting. As in the reading she says, ""As if oblivious to the cold, his mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel."" This late harvesting suggests a lack of preparedness for the approaching cold. Therefore, the implication is that she intends to learn from this experience and be better prepared for the next winter season."
1164	10029	4	3	The author concluded the story in this manner so that the audience would feel sympathy and understanding for the things that Saeng and her family were going through in this hard time. It makes the reader feel sympathy for Saeng because all she can think of to make herself feel better is her home town and how she got taken away from it, highlighting the deep sense of loss and displacement she experiences. This evokes a powerful emotional connection with the reader, fostering empathy for her situation.
1165	10030	4	3	He concludes the story because he was offered another chance to enact the test. This second opportunity presented itself after a period of reflection, allowing him to approach the challenge with a clearer understanding of the potential outcomes and his own motivations, thus bringing the narrative to its natural resolution.
1166	10031	4	3	"The author concluded ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to emphasize a new life and new chances for the main character. The future setting of the paragraph, spring, symbolizes rebirth and another start from the cold, hard winter. The author takes this to heart including more events which enhance this symbolized meaning. The author uses structured choice to carry her thoughts. To convey the theme of rebirth, the author uses words like ""the geese return"" and ""take the test again"" which add to the importance at the home. Also, the literal action of the ""hibiscus is budding"" symbolizes rebirth. In winter the plant is dormant and less colorful, but in the spring the plant shows rebirth through its colorful buds. The author finally conveys the theme of rebirth by ending with this paragraph, solidifying the idea of new beginnings for the character and reinforcing the hope that spring brings."
1167	10032	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, it tells of a girl who just moved to a new country & is having a hard time adapting to the new land & its people. But I think the author put that quote at the end to lead you to believe to never give up, there is a new beginning & you will make it. I believe this because Saeng thinks to herself, ""almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she thought of strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her."" This shows that Saeng finally has found comfort & is confident, like the geese, who instinctively know where they are going and going to adapt in a new area, & then will come back, & that the winter hibiscus never gives up & will keep living in the new weather conditions every season. This resilience, mirrored in both the geese and the hibiscus, signifies a hopeful message about the potential for adaptation and growth, ultimately suggesting that even in the face of unfamiliarity, one can find a sense of belonging and thrive."
1168	10033	4	3	She concludes the things at the end of her paragraph, saying she will review everything when winter is done. She will then be able to retake the test again in the spring, showing that she is already planning ahead for improvement. That is what she was writing about.
1169	10034	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she is trying to adapt to her new surrounds. The hibiscus reminds her of her old life and it comforts her. So when she takes her test in the spring she will feel better and more comfortable while she is remembering her old life in a new place. In the story it says that she failed her test and then she bought a plant that reminded her of her old life. The plant brought back memories of her old life and that helped comfort her. The spring reminds her of her old life because the flowers in the garden are blooming, the geese return, and the snow has melted. Saeng feels like she could adapt to her new surroundings with the comfort of her memories of her old life, suggesting a hopeful outlook for her future.
1170	10035	4	3	"The author chose this paragraph because it fit right like a good conclusion, showing for example, the word ""again."" It means that you did something already and it's over, but you miss it, so you retry what you missed; but in the paragraph, it's talking about nature and how they want to test it (""again"")! This highlights a cyclical process, not necessarily of regret, but of repeated examination and experimentation within the natural world, concluding the exploration."
1171	10036	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it still shows how determined Saeng is to take the test again and pass it this time. By ending this story with the paragraph, the author is creating suspense, probably for a sequel or another story, leaving the reader eager to find out if Saeng will finally achieve his goal. This hints at further challenges and triumphs that may lie ahead for Saeng, making the audience anticipate his future endeavors.
1172	10037	4	3	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" a young girl from Vietnam moves to America and fails the driver's test. After she decides to spend money on a winter hibiscus to remind her of her homeland, the ending paragraph, ""When Troy come back, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" shows deep feeling towards nature. She feels as when the geese are ready to return home and when the hibiscus is ready to bud, so will she be ready and she will take the driver's test again. This reflects her connection to the natural cycles as a source of hope and renewal, suggesting her readiness will coincide with the return of spring."
1173	10038	4	3	"She is talking about the flowers, and when she says ""test,"" I think she means how she looks, examining the flowers and seeing the snow fall all over again. It sounds like the author is someone who admires flowers a lot, or maybe just this one hibiscus, and how it buds. Maybe she is just someone who likes to see changes, observing the subtle transformations and cycles of nature with a keen eye."
1174	10039	4	3	I believe the author adds this passage to the story to represent determination and America. While Saeng is not originally from Laos, she is determined and willing to try and adapt to American customs. While the winter was cold and harsh in many ways for her, the Spring will bring forgiveness and relief from her hardships. She will try to pass the driving test again to further herself into American culture, while the blooming of the Hibiscus will bring her memories of home.
1175	10040	4	3	"The author probably concludes the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng has realized she needs to be confident, and to also end the story on a good note. Also, the author wraps things familiar with Saeng, and things native to her new home into the last paragraph. At the beginning of the story, the girl seemed very upset and lost in this country, and missed her home greatly. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" But once she gets home, and tells her mother she failed her driving test, she seems to feel better, indicating a shift in her emotional state. Towards the end, after she planted the hibiscus, she sees geese and she feels as if they're ""almost familiar"". The paragraph that ends the selection does a good job of tying her past (the hibiscus), her present (the geese & the snow) and the drama of the story (failing the test) into one, suggesting a sense of integration and hope for the future."
1176	10041	4	3	She wanted to learn, and do more things. She loved the way the plants looked at the store, their vibrant colors and interesting shapes captivating her. Her mother got the plant, a small rose bush, went home, and they started planting it in the backyard. The daughter loved the plant very much, carefully watering it each day. And she said that next year I’ll grow a plant as wonderful as the one her mom was growing, full of beautiful blooms.
1177	10042	4	3	I think the author concludes this paragraph in this story to describe how grown up Saeng is now since it doesn't look like she leaves with her mom anymore. The author probably wants to emphasize the reader's understanding of Saeng's present, now that she probably lives independently, since she doesn't leave with her mom anymore. What happened was just her past and will remain memorable to Saeng, highlighting her transition to adulthood.
1178	10043	4	3	"The author uses that passage to end the story to show that Saeng will try to adopt. When Saeng smells the Hibiscus ìThe familiar fragrance filled her lungs and Saeng [she] could almost feel. The light sounds of her grandmotherís long gray hair"" This shows that Saeng was looking for things that were familiar to her and reminded her of her homeland. The fact that Saeng paid over nineteen dollars for a plant also shows how much she missed her homeland. ""d-d failed the test that Saeng paid.î This tells the reader that she attempted to adapt to her new home but failed. This makes her sad and causes her to miss the way things used to be. at the end of the story she said that ""I [she] will take the test again."" Seeing the familiar hibiscus and geese leaving knowing that they will return gives Saeng hope. The last line in the story emphasizes the regard they both will always remember her homeland."
1179	10044	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng isn't going to give up. Despite the setbacks and the initial sting of failure, the memory of her grandmother's unwavering belief in her, coupled with the spark of determination that had always resided within her, rekindled her resolve. She understood that the path to success was rarely linear, and this experience, though painful, was simply a bend in the road, not the end of it.
1180	10045	4	3	With the hibiscus around Saeng, she will have more courage and also have had more time to adapt in their new home. For Saeng, the hibiscus is like motivation, a vibrant splash of her past that also reminds her of her old homeland and the life she left behind. The reason I think the author chose to end the story with that particular comment is to show that Saeng had, in the end, found courage, symbolized by the thriving hibiscus, and is ready to accept her tasks and embrace her future in this foreign land.
1181	10046	4	3	The story concludes that paragraph because it tells you that there are changes in the weather and seasons just as there are in your life, implying you have to sometimes deal with changes. The test might be one to see if she can understand herself and that things don't always stay the same. There are changes in the weather all the time; there are changes in the spring and fall, and you just have to get over it and accept that change is a constant.
1182	10047	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the writer ends with a paragraph that concludes the story. One of the reasons she concluded with the last paragraph the way she did is because it tells the reader that Saeng has not given up on her driver's test. “Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This explains in more detail when she will take the test again, another year on, and also because it leaves the reader to think about how the rest of the story will go, implying that her determination remains strong despite the initial setback, suggesting a hopeful future.
1183	10048	4	3	"I believe that the author's conclusion, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" was a great way to end it because she sees how much the hibiscus can take, and believes she can endure just about anything, mainly the test. Also, when her mother said, ""You what?"" and ""Her mother stared at her incredulously,"" she might have understood that if her mum could get over being mad, then she would overcome being upset about the test; much like the hibiscus, she too can recover and bloom again. Therefore, the ending signifies Saeng's renewed hope and determination, drawing strength from the resilience of nature and her mother's eventual acceptance."
1184	10049	4	3	The writer writes this conclusion to the end of the story because he wants people to know that the seasons are changing and the flowers are going to be dying. He also wants you to know that when the season changes back, the flower will try and fit again with the other flowers. That's what the author means when he talks about taking the test again; the flower will strive to belong once more, even after facing adversity.
1185	10050	4	3	The hibiscus flower is viewed as a symbol of hope and a reminder of their homeland. When Saeng first sees it in the florist shop, she is taken over by memories of home and how all the flowers grew freely there. I believe the author wants the new flower to represent an opportunity for Saeng and her mother to do the same in America. Planting the flower is a representation of adaptation, since they have moved to a new land. Saeng seems to be using it as a motivation when she says ìwhen this hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again.î The paragraph provides closure and a sense of hope, which is an excellent note to end on, suggesting a positive future as they cultivate a new life.
1186	10051	4	3	the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it tells that if you fail the first time, there is always a second time, just like the seed I dies in the winter and it comes back alive in the spring. This cyclical nature, evident in the seed's journey, mirrors the potential for renewal and second chances in life itself. The initial failure is not the end, but a necessary phase before rebirth and renewed growth, offering a message of enduring hope.
1187	10052	4	3	The author leaves us at the end of the story saying “when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The author said that because the girl Saeng failed the test but still found something that reminded her of her home. She was happy, but the plants were not exactly like the ones from home. But she got used to it. The flower may not be the same, but it’s an exotic flower, and she is getting used to being in a new place. When she goes back to take the test, she will be ready, and so will her plant, now thriving in its new environment. Her plant will be full of life, just as she has found a renewed sense of hope.
1188	10053	4	3	I think the author ends the story like this because of Saeng's respect for the plant. Not only does she see the plant as a symbol of her home but also as a symbol of good luck. In the text she holds the plant in a very high value, having paid 5 coins for it. So, I think it ends like this to symbolize that Saeng believes that the best time to take the test is when the hibiscus is growing, signifying her hope for success is intertwined with the plant's vitality.
1189	10054	4	3	The author includes that paragraph at the end of the story because it connects Saeng to the geese and plant with symbolism. For Saeng, the snow represents her troubles adjusting to America, the geese show her that she is, even now adapting to her new homeland when the geese seem familiar. The Korean hibiscus was pretty but the new American hibiscus, which symbolizes her since she came to America, is adapted to be more resilient and withstand the snow which symbolizes her problems adapting to America. For Saeng, the hibiscus budding again represents her becoming stronger and overcoming her troubles. She wants to go take the test again when she is stronger. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to connect the Hibiscus budding with Saeng overcoming her obstacles, offering a symbolic resolution to her struggles and hinting at a hopeful future.
1190	10055	4	3	The author chose to conclude the story like that because she’s saying that it isn’t over and she’s going to take the test again. In the story Saeng says “I- I failed the test” so she’s determined to go back when the flower blooms again to get things right, indicating a cycle of learning and perseverance, and suggesting that the journey towards understanding is ongoing.
1191	10056	4	3	I think what the author is trying to say is that she will take her driving test again in the spring when the flowers are out because it will make her feel more relaxed and less anxious. The flowers put the author in a relaxed state of mind where she can focus, and this improved focus should help her to perform better on the test, increasing her chances of passing. Therefore, waiting for spring and the blooming flowers is a strategic decision to optimize her mental state and improve her test performance.
1192	10057	4	3	Because she saying when the nails grow back she will be ready to take the test again.
1193	10058	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with that final sentence likely because it signifies the end of the growing season for the plants, but it also implies a promise of return when the time is right. She will be back to nurture them, as caring for these plants has become a central part of her life. The author might have also ended the story in this way to pique the reader's interest, leaving them in a state of anticipation, wondering if she will indeed return to the plants and her studies. Another reason for this ending could be that, despite the current snowfall, she remains committed to the plants but understands that their care must wait until the appropriate season arrives. Her statement, ""when they come back then I will take the test again,"" demonstrates her unwavering dedication and her intention to persevere in pursuing her passions, showing that she is not giving up on the things she loves and will continue to strive until she succeeds."
1194	10059	4	3	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus"", I think the author uses the last paragraph to show that although the memories of her old country would always be with her, she soon will adapt to her new one. Also, from time to time she still will visit her old country. For example, ""when the snow melts and the geese return,"" hints at the cyclical nature of her visits. The last sentence, ""then I will take the test again,"" suggests that once she is adapted to this country and goes back to her old one, she still will enjoy them either way, indicating a comfortable existence in both cultures; therefore, she will always cherish both of her homes."
1195	10060	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is going to retake the test when these seasonal changes occur. Saeng shows that she is not going to give up, and that she is going to keep trying. The hibiscus serves as a lucky charm, something to keep with her during the test, striving to help her pass. In addition, the author also concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng's personal thoughts and feelings about this test. The arrival of spring, the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus are all indications that it is time to give the test another try. In conclusion, the paragraph is an indication that Saeng is never going to forget this experience and the lessons she learned, and that she'll carry them forward with renewed determination.
1196	10061	4	3	The author concludes the story with the last paragraph of the story. When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, their I will take that test again, ready to prove her understanding and determination.
1197	10062	4	3	I guess she felt that it was a good way to unit all up, bringing everyone together for a common purpose. This sense of unity, she believed, would foster stronger relationships.
1198	10063	4	3	In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with Saeng saying “I will take that test, again,” it means that Saeng will be ready as soon as the spring arrives and her hibiscus is all in bloom. When Saeng bought the hibiscus, she was sure that as soon as the winter passes with the coming of spring, she is sure that taking the driver's test again will be easier; the blooming hibiscus mirrors her own anticipated growth and resilience, helping to overcome the fear and grieving times in a new place. This means that Saeng is able to overcome her fear of a new place. Saeng is also sure that the memories of her homeland will help her, too, providing her with a sense of grounding and strength. In the end, it's revealed that Saeng has become strong and has high hopes to see her success be fulfilled in her new homeland, demonstrating her newfound determination to thrive.
1199	10064	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows the hibiscus's determination. In the spring it will be hard for the hibiscus to survive because it's a winter hibiscus, and the author highlighting its resilience underscores its determination to live, even against the odds.
1200	10065	4	3	"I believe the author used that statement to end the story because by the end Saeng was ready to face her obstacles again, also it shows that she was appreciating her new environment. The plant that Saeng purchased, her mother stated that, ""it is strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This is telling Saeng that if the plant can make it through the harsh conditions, then just maybe she can make it through living in a new country. When Saeng realized that things had a repetition season upon season, she must have realized that she can do it too, and face the driving test again, understanding that life, like the seasons, has its own cycles of challenges and renewal, giving her the strength to persevere."
1201	10066	4	3	The author includes this last paragraph in the story, ìWinter Hibiscusî to show that the main character still has hopes and has not given up on her new lifestyle. During the story, the main character Saeng reminisces on her not so distant past memories of her native home in Vietnam when she recognizes a certain plant from her country. This is important in the story because Saeng is still unhappy about moving to America and she begins to cry as she walks home, having bought the plant, to her mother. ìA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saengís eyes now swept over her.î Saengís mother understood how she was feeling, and she was not dissapointed in her for failing her driving test either. Her mother made Saeng feel better by planting the familiar Hibiscus into the garden right away. The last paragraph of the story gives hope to the reader that Saeng will not give up her strength to live a different life in America that she is not used to. ìWhen the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î It is as if Saeng is vowing that in time, she will be happy with her new life, not just passing a driving test, suggesting a willingness to adapt. The Winter Hibiscus stands as a symbol for Saeng to be strong in the new country while still remembering her old life in Vietnam, showing her resilience.
1202	10067	4	3	wheN they coMe back, SaeNg vowed sileNtly to herself, iN the SpriNg, wheN the snow melts and the geese returN and this hibiscus is buddiNg, theN I will take the test agaiN because wheN the plaNt begiNs to blossom she will feel more confideNt and comfortable. At time you caN see how she's triNg to adapt to new surroundiNgs. I believe that the hibiscus represeNts comfort at times of disappoiNtmeNt and, a connectioN to her past expeirences.

So wheN it SpriNg agaiN and the hibiscus is fully bloomed that why she take the test agaiN because she will feel more comfortable in and with her surroundiNgs. It symbolizes her personal growth and readiness. That is why the author MiNfoNg Ho conclued the story the way he did.
1203	10068	4	3	The past experiences of our lives often influence things in our life, whether we consciously know it or not. In this story Saeng tries to go to the flower shop and pass the test of not buying the certain flower that reminds her of her home, when she fails. She is trying to get over the fact that she is not ‘at home,’ that things and people that used to be ground no longer are, and this is shown through her connection with the flower. But there are new things that she is becoming used to, and she is beginning to find her footing. I think that the author ends the story with the paragraph that he did, to show that you can always change. She is trying to put things that make her used to her old home further back in her mind, and with time, she can do that maybe even by next year, because it is always possible to do something if you really wants to do it, and the author is showing that Saeng really wants to pass her own mind test, so she can further adapt to change, and ultimately make her mother proud of her.
1204	10069	4	3	I think that she was that way to say, hey, I didn't overcome something, and I'll be back next year to take the test again, like the hibiscus budding when the snow melts and the geese return @CAPS1 year. It's a cycle of perseverance, a commitment to returning and trying again.
1205	10070	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted the readers to know that Saeng was going to take the test over again, showing her resilience. Despite the initial setback and disappointment she faced, the ending implies a continuation of her efforts, suggesting she hadn't given up on her goals. This reinforces the idea that perseverance is key to success, even after experiencing failure, and leaves the reader with a sense of hope for Saeng's future.
1206	10071	4	3	When Saeng said that she will go and take the test over next year, she means trying to plant the plants all over again. When Saeng says ìHere, let me help, mother,î right then you know that Saeng does want to help with the plants after all, showing her initial reluctance was perhaps just a passing feeling, and that ultimately she does care about the success of their shared endeavor.
1207	10072	4	3	"The author's choice of the last paragraph in the short story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" shows the hope for the future that Seang feels. The winter and cold represent how she feels out of place and upset at not receiving her driver's license, which is a symbol of independence in her new country. In the spring, with the promise of the hibiscus blooming, she will have a piece of her homeland blooming and she will be warm again, both literally and figuratively. She will feel ready to take her test again “when they came back,"" signifying a renewed sense of optimism. This shows adapting to and accepting her new life away from her home and her memories, and embracing the possibilities it holds. The last paragraph proves that she was strong enough to move past her hardships and move on, finding solace and a sense of belonging in her new environment through the enduring symbol of her winter hibiscus."
1208	10073	4	3	The speaker @MONTH1 conclude the story with that paragraph because the geese returning and the hibiscus budding @MONTH1 help her with her confidence. She wants to feel like she can do this test, and these signs of renewal and resilience in nature mirror her own hopes for success and give her the strength to believe in herself.
1209	10074	4	3	when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese returned this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. The image of the returning geese filled her with renewed hope. She realized she has another chance to pass the test, when the spring blossoms again she begin to garden when the spring returns, nurturing not only the plants but also her own resolve to succeed this time.
1210	10075	4	3	Saeng finds comfort in memories of her homeland. When she took that test, everything was unfamiliar to her, so she failed, but on her way back something familiar found her. Native plants of her home. There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single bloodred blossom, floating in the bucket. Saeng needs familiar things to comfort herself. So when she sees the geese, this symbolizes change and the hope it brings. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched. Spring is a time for new beginnings, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. When the familiar object is at its best, she will be her best and be able to face anything. Winter is the getting-ready stage. Only when the hibiscus blooms fully, mirroring the warmth and vibrancy of her homeland, can she truly feel ready to embrace the future.
1211	10076	4	3	The author of Winter Hibiscus ended the story with the paragraph, ìwhen they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snowsmelt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î She did this because she bought the flower when she failed the test, a small winter hibiscus to remind her of home and her determination. So when the flower blooms, a symbol of resilience and new beginnings, she will take the test again, ready to face the challenge with renewed spirit.
1212	10077	4	3	I think the author tried to say when it's coming to snow melt, like @MONTH1, then she will be back. The author will, because in the spring sometime, write a new book. It seems the author's return is connected to the changing seasons and new creative work in the spring.
1213	10078	4	3	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" uses this paragraph to conclude her story because it is a symbol of Saeng’s future. Winter Hibiscus is a symbol of Saeng for many reasons. For one, both Saeng and the plant are from Vietnam and both struggle to survive and thrive in the new world of the United States. Saeng promises herself that when the plant thrives in the spring, so shall she by retaking her driver’s test. This symbol of future is extremely important to the story and this is why Minfong Ho, the author of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" chose to end with this vital symbol, suggesting hope and resilience."
1214	10079	4	3	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author most likely chose this as the last paragraph to help the reader understand the message. The message of this story is no matter what happens or what challenges you face, never give up and always keep trying. The author makes that the last paragraph to make the reader think and ponder upon what it means, solidifying Saeng’s resolve and leaving the reader with a hopeful image of perseverance."
1215	10080	4	3	The author concluded the story with this paragraph for one reason. That reason is because Saeng thinks she failed because she got a fake plant instead of a real one. She felt disappointed when she brought it home. For example, she said “I failed,” talking about the plant, revealing her sense of inadequacy. She also compares where she is now to where she used to live, highlighting her feelings of displacement. For example, she said “it’s not like the one at home,” emphasizing her longing for familiarity and authenticity. That’s why the author concludes this paragraph, solidifying Saeng's feelings of disillusionment and highlighting the symbolic weight of the artificial plant.
1216	10081	4	3	"""When they comeback, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This statement aligns with the story because Saeng finds solace and determination in her garden, a place inaccessible during the snowy winter months. Her love for plants is evident, making the budding hibiscus a symbol of renewed hope and a promise to revisit the test when spring arrives. The connection to plants runs deeper; perhaps she recalls a similar plant, maybe even visiting a florist later, only to be disappointed if something were to go wrong with them, further emphasizing the emotional importance she places on the natural world, thus solidifying her resolve to retake the test alongside nature's rebirth."
1217	10082	4	3	"In the text, when the mother said ìItís flowers arenít as pretty, but itís strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. Thatís what matterî This sentence shows that Saeng is just like the flowers. Theyíre strong to live through the winter, showing resilience even if their outward appearance isn't the most striking. This suggests they are inherently pretty and strong, capable of blooming fully in the spring. This emphasis that Saeng will be strong and more confident in the spring, having weathered her own ""winter."" Thatís why the author put it in at the end, as a symbol of hope and future growth. Itís also reflected to the flower, how theyíre pretty and strong in spring, further reinforcing the idea of inner strength leading to eventual flourishing."
1218	10083	4	3	In the short story, ìWinter Hibiscus,î by Minfong Ho, the author includes a paragraph at the end, stating that the main character, Saeng, will take her driving test again. Ho includes this paragraph to show that Saeng is determined to adapt. Saeng is new to the United States; she and her mother had moved there from Vietnam. Throughout the story she is reminiscing about her home life in Vietnam, about her grandmother, and the flowers there. ìWhere was me...hibiscus hedge?.. Her gentle grandmother?î When at the flower shop, Saeng finds a hibiscus, a flower they also had in Vietnam. She sees how it has adapted to survive in the winter here, despite the unfamiliar climate. As she is planting the flower in her backyard, she makes a promise to herself to pass the driving test next spring. She, too, wants to become adapted to the United States and be able to live there without missing home too much. This vow she made is included in the last paragraph; the author included it to show Saeng, too, wants to adapt to her surroundings and pass the driving test, demonstrating her resilience and willingness to embrace her new life.
1219	10084	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the true meaning of the hibiscus. The hibiscus is symbolic to Saeng in several ways, but the most important is that it represents change and growth and the ability to overcome obstacles. Upon seeing it, she is overcome with childhood memories and sentimentality, longing for her familiar life. However, she must adjust to her new home if she wants to grow as a person and adapt to her surroundings. She will survive here, just as the hibiscus will survive through the winter and bloom again. Also, Saeng vows that “in the spring” when “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She is determined to succeed and persevere, and the hibiscus itself represents triumph over obstacles. It stands for survival and endurance through life’s disappointments and challenges, from failing a driver’s test to starting a new life in a strange and foreign country. The author’s choice to end the story with this paragraph exhibits Saeng’s ultimate understanding of her strength through the symbol of the hibiscus, highlighting her resilient spirit.
1220	10085	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the paragraph like that because he/she wanted to show an important message to the audience. The message that the author was trying to get across was that even though she didn't pass the test she was going to try again next year. An example of this is an exact quote ìin the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test againî. This shows resilience and determination, highlighting that failure is not final, but rather an opportunity for future success, which is why I think the author concludes the story like that.
1221	10086	4	3	The author includes the story with this paragraph because since Saeng failed her driver's test the first time when the hibiscus starts to bud, it will represent a change in her life, potentially signifying a fresh start. Also, Saeng used to have hibiscus flowers at her old home in Vietnam, so when the flower buds it could show that she has a new home and is beginning to put down roots in a new place, connecting her past and present.
1222	10087	4	3	The author finished the story with, ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again.î The reason for conclusion is that it is important for Saeng to feel at home. When the hibiscus buds it will remind her of home and this will comfort her; its familiar presence a link to everything she knows and loves. When she feels at peace and at home, surrounded by the comforting signs of spring that resonate with her past, she will be calmer and more focused, and thus do better on the test.
1223	10088	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show she is not giving up on her new home or forgetting her old one. She shows she isn’t giving up when she brings home the flower to plant. That also shows she will not forget her old home, keeping a piece of it with her. Also when she says, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” that shows she is giving her new home another shot and isn’t giving up on her goal. Another example is when it says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Here she is accepting the changes and giving her new home another chance as she adapts to the new environment. She is not giving up on it, but embracing its possibilities while honoring her past.
1224	10089	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is ready to do the same thing next year. She likes spending time with her mom, she likes plants, and she likes having fun with her mom. These are some reasons why she concludes with that paragraph, hinting at the anticipation and joy she feels about continuing this special tradition, solidifying the bond and shared interests between mother and daughter.
1225	10090	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides comfort. Saeng failed her driving test and was new to LOCATION1; she was frustrated and was missing her real home in Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. She writes ìshe closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungsî after Saeng smelled the flower it reminded her of ìcombing her grandmotherís long grey hair, freshly washedî it brought her comfort in a time of disappointment. She didnít have her grandmother, but the flower comforted her, acting as a sensory bridge to her past. Although she was disappointed, the hibiscus was ìexquisite,î and as she said the word ìdokor malikî meaning hibiscus, she ìsavored the feel of the word on her tongue.î The joy and comfort is what the flower brings to Saeng; she will take the test again in the spring when ìthe snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, thus bringing joy, love, and comfort to the reader as they feel what Saeng feels, offering a sense of hope and renewal.
1226	10091	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph because it relates the idea of the hibiscus to Saeng and her situation in a new country. It shows that Saeng is using the hibiscus and its ability to adapt for inspiration. During the story, Saeng describes how she had always seen the hibiscus at home in her old country. Her mom describes to her that the hibiscus she bought is a bit different from the one back home. But she says itís because itís strong and was able to adapt to the cold winter environment of the United States, even though it's not what it was used to. This is what Saeng was able to use as inspiration. She might have failed her license test, but she used the hibiscus actions to set a goal for herself. The plant will go through a cold, and snowy winter but it will grow and blossom in the spring. Saeng would use that time to study and get ready, and sheíll be confident for the test, just like the hibiscus is resilient. The paragraph that the author finishes on shows the connection Saeng made with her situation and the plantís situation, highlighting her newfound determination.
1227	10092	4	3	ìIf at first you donít succeed, try, try again.î This quote is used by many parents trying to encourage their children or by coaches to motivate their team. The quote can also apply to Saengís situation in the short story, ìWinter Hibiscus.î Saeng fails her driver's test and, when walking home after the test, notices a hibiscus flower which reminds her of her homeland. Sadness encompasses her and she purchases the plant to pacify her grief. She brings it home and is at first reprimanded by her mother but then thanked for buying it. While Saeng is planting the hibiscus, she hears the honk of Canada geese which had become familiar to her by then. The text says, ìAlmost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.î This quote shows the adaptation she had to face in coming to **Canada**. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower, she will adapt to the terrain and toils of **Canada**. The hibiscus inspires her to push forward and try again for her license as the plant pushed forward through winter.
1228	10093	4	3	The author ends the story this way because Saeng feels a sense of comfort with the hibiscus flower. The flower reminds her of her homeland with her grandmother. According to the story “the familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair.” you can also tell she misses her homeland but always keeps it close to her heart wherever she goes. The text states that, “it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.” She seems to be very close with nature and all of its desirable traits. When she failed the test she bought her “Malik” flower, as a sense of comfort. They both decided to plant it in their garden, and while doing so, Saeng received a huge boost of confidence to retake the test. This act of planting, connecting with nature through the hibiscus, ultimately empowers her to face her challenges again, showing the enduring power of memory and connection to home.
1229	10094	4	3	"She compares the paragraph to the story to then compare it to school. The ""test"" is making new friends and doing well on tests and in classes. In the paragraph, it said, ""Then I will take that test again."" That is the reason she is comparing that paragraph to school, signifying a continuous cycle of learning and assessment."
1230	10095	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's determination to overcome the obstacles of her past experience. For example, the story starts out with Saeng taking a 'test', while reliving her memories in the greenhouse, she started to breakdown. “A wave of loss so deep and strong it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her."" She then buys the plant and takes it home to her mother, telling her that she 'failed'. The mother then becomes understanding and helps Saeng vow to retake the 'test', the narrator emphasizes Saeng’s determination to overcome the troubles of her past and go on with the future, showcasing her resilience and resolve to face what's ahead."
1231	10096	4	3	Because her school work was the whole reason as to why she was studying flowers in a green garden. And it is obvious she failed the test, so when spring starts to show, she will retake the test because the flowers will bloom, and she can do more study to pass the test and not have to take it again. I get the feeling, though, she is also looking forward to the spring time coming back now an day so she can enjoy the flowers and the presents of growing and studying, finding joy and satisfaction in both academic success and the simple pleasures of observing nature's beauty.
1232	10097	4	3	"I think that the author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because she wanted us to see that Saeng was not giving up. Saeng was originally from Vietnam but she moved to the United States. She missed being home so much because nothing was the same. ìItís not a real one,î Saeng mumbled. ëI mean, not like the kind we had at-at'. She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home. But once Saeng finally realized that she was beginning to adapt to the life in the United States, she decided that she was going to give the driveís test one more try, showing her willingness to embrace her new life while still holding onto memories of her past. ìWhen they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" signaling her renewed hope for the future."
1233	10098	4	3	"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she seems to feel comfortable when she saw the geese and plants the hibiscus in the winter and keeps it from dying. In the story it said,""... their faint banks clear and -yes- familiar to Saeng now"". This explains how she feels after seeing the geese fly overhead, connecting her to her past in Vietnam. Also, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"", she gains more confidence because she feels like she’s back in Vietnam, finding a sense of continuity and hope in her new environment. The hibiscus, nurtured through the winter, symbolizes her own resilience and adaptation. All in all, that's why the author concludes the story with that paragraph, showing Saeng's growing sense of belonging."
1234	10099	4	3	I think the reason why the author concludes the story with that paragraph is to allow the reader to imagine what happens next for Saeng once spring rolls around. This allows the reader to use their imagination to connect to the story and consider the possibilities that lie ahead for her. Another reason why the author chose to conclude the story like that was to give hope to the reader that maybe she will pass the test next time, showing her resilience. It was also a way to end the story on a good note, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism.
1235	10100	4	3	The author ended the story with that particular paragraph because, like the geese, she will be back to try again. Just in case she didn’t get to finish just about everything she wanted to do, the author wanted the reader to know the determination and ambition of the character in the story. Also, to show the readers that the character's characteristics couldn’t be beat by one winter and that she is going to keep going at it until she does what she has to do, demonstrating an enduring spirit.
1236	10101	4	3	The author of the story ìWinter Hibiscusî most likely concludes it with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test to show that even in difficult times and new situations a person can never give up and sink into despair and that there always things to comfort someone. In the story, glimpses of Saeng's home are given in her memories and from them, the reader can understand what a difficult day Saeng is having. The author is describing these warm, comforting memories to help clash with the cold, bitter day the girl is having. ìShe closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs.î Here, Saeng recalls a memory of her grandmother and it saddens her at the thought of her home and her loss. The author builds up Saengís despair and upset for the final paragraph. The author has this as the final paragraph because it shows hope. As Saeng says, ìthen I will take that test again,î you can feel her hope. Also, the author wants to express how there is still structure and stability in a changing world and that you can look to the simple things. Saeng says, ìthe geese return and this hibiscus is budding,î and this shows how there are some reliable things that can give you security when you think you have none. The author uses this last paragraph to balance the feeling of despair in the story, to emphasize the need for hope and to show that there always things that can give you hope and security, ultimately leaving the reader with a sense of resilience.
1237	10102	4	3	The author concludes the story of the paragraph because the author would like to finish the last sentence of the story. Also, at the last of the paragraph is when she is visualizing and putting her effort to the hibiscus. Therefore, her thoughts are appreciated to the plant. The author wanted more evidence to the story; for example, when it said, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, it includes the winter time for the plant. Also, the character expects that by spring the plant comes back, and then she will get it back and visit it, thus signifying the end of this particular chapter of her life and her renewed hope.
1238	10103	4	3	The author made it seem like he did not like it, but he loved flowers and he liked working in the store with the people. His mom is nearby, and he liked to see her together with his life that came back because they liked the place. He enjoyed being around the familiar faces and sharing the beauty of the flowers, despite any initial reservations. Ultimately, the shared experiences and the sense of community made the work fulfilling.
1239	10104	4	3	"The author includes this at the end to show how much she cares about the plant and that its smells brought her back to her childhood. An example of her loving the plant is that ""rich scent"" (Paragraph Minfong Ho), @CAPS1 examples ""It felt smooth and cool"" (paragraph Minfong Ho). An example of its connection to childhood is that she had not even realized she had known it but had forgotten; its return allowed her to recall (paragraphs Minfong Ho). For these reasons, it seems clear that the author adds that detail at the end to emphasize the plant's significance."
1240	10105	4	3	The author's placement of this detail as the story's final note suggests a powerful message. Having relocated to an unfamiliar environment and culture, the girl clings to the memory of a familiar wildflower from her old home. This vow to herself, tied to the plant's life cycle, is a commitment to resilience and open-mindedness. It signifies her determination not to surrender to the challenges of her new life, but rather to embrace the unknown possibilities that await. The plant serves as a symbol of new beginnings, its regrowth mirroring her own journey of adaptation and self-discovery. It's a representation of her life itself, where the plant's fresh start parallels her own, reinforcing the idea that new experiences and growth are always possible, leading to a hopeful outlook for her future.
1241	10106	4	3	I think the author wrote that because maybe that's how she feels. Like in the winter, she could really show people who she is, but when spring comes out, she's like a flower that has been dead all winter, finally able to bloom and express its true colors.
1242	10107	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph before they were talking about the ""winter hibiscus"" and the geese. So, the author simply writes another concluding paragraph that wraps the story up, and the reader walks away with a feel-good feeling, understanding the quiet beauty and resilience found even in the face of the cold."
1243	10108	4	3	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, it explains the obstacles Saeng went through coming to a different country. In this story, Saeng had just failed her driving test as she was reminded of her home through some tropical flowers. Moreover, the author writes at the end of the story referring to geese, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, it the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again."" This part of the story is very important because it examines her growth and hope for change, just as the geese will come back and the hibiscus will change into a beautiful blossomed flower. Furthermore, it explains to the reader that she will not give up and that she will change to the environment just as the plant life has and the geese come back to the changed environment. That part of the story is very important for the reader, as it concludes Saeng's thoughts and hopes for the future while adapting to her new environment."
1244	10109	4	3	The author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason. I think the author wanted to give an interseting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows! For example, the author explain how the hibiscus grow and things that are needed for it to grow, like sunlight, water, soil, and picking up there waste. Maybe the author figure that explaining that when it snows the process begans all over again the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason. I think the author wanted to give an interseting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows! For example, the author explain how the hibiscus grow and things that are needed for it to grow, like sunlight, water, soil, and picking up there waste. Maybe the author figure that explaining that when it snows the process begans all over again, providing a cyclical view of nature and the resilience of the hibiscus. This ending would emphasize the continuous process of growth and renewal, even after a period of dormancy brought on by winter, thus creating a satisfying sense of closure.
1245	10110	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng said she failed the test, and when spring comes back then she will take the test again. The last paragraph reads ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.î She really does not tell us what test she is supposed to be taking, only that it is important enough to tie to the changing seasons and the rebirth they represent, giving the impending attempt a sense of hopeful determination.
1246	10111	4	3	The reason why she said she will wait til spring to take the test again, is to see if she's still like the bitter melon over the Big-Mac, hoping her palate might change with the seasons and a fresh perspective might improve her performance.
1247	10112	4	3	The author concludes the end of this story with this paragraph because it's like saying to take the test again. What she means by this is that she will have to do the same thing next year. She will have to adapt to life just like the hibiscus did, facing new challenges and changes. She is also saying to do her best because everything in the world thrives by living to its fullest potential. So it's a good conclusion for the story, emphasizing resilience and the importance of embracing life's journey.
1248	10113	4	3	I think that the reason the author concludes the story like that is that it allows for an open ending. This open ending also lets you know that the story is not necessarily finished, and that they could make more. The author's choice provides the opportunity to continue the narrative in the future, leaving the audience with a sense of anticipation.
1249	10114	4	3	What the author concludes is that in the springtime, when the snow melts and the flowers come back, it diminishes the risk of spring-time at home, which makes her relax. Also, springtime is a prettier time because all the flowers are out, especially the flower that reminds her of home and its blessings, allowing a sense of peace to return.
1250	10115	4	3	Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. She remembered failing it before, the disappointment still stinging. Saeng is going to wait to take the test when she knows that she will pass the test so she can get her licensed. Saeng wants her licensed so she can drive anywhere she wants to go. So she don't have to get her mom to take her everywhere she wants to go she can take her ownself anywhere she wants. But she has to wait till the snows is melted before she takes her test again, giving her time to practice and feel truly ready.
1251	10116	4	3	The paragraph shows that Saeng has a lot of feelings for her plants. She enjoys plants and loves taking the time to spend with them, carefully tending to their needs. She means in that last paragraph that she can't wait for winter to leave so her plants will be budding and full of new life, and that she can enjoy their beauty and the sense of renewal they bring.
1252	10117	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it ties it all together, offering a sense of hope and resolution. I think that the author uses it also to say that in the spring she will pass the test, symbolizing a fresh start and a triumph over the challenges she faced. I really like the part when she says ""in the spring, when the snows melt."" I like that because it explains what she wants and how she puts her mind to it, suggesting that with perseverance, she will achieve her goals, just as winter gives way to spring."
1253	10118	4	3	"The author most likely uses this paragraph to show her setting a goal for the cycle to start over. She uses geese as a symbol for spring, when she would start preparing for this ""test"" once again. The hibiscus budding in this paragraph shows hope, because it is, once again, a start of a cycle as well as an object of reminiscence in the story, reminding her of past experiences. In conclusion, this concluding paragraph uses several symbols and devices to convey hope, good memories, and a fresh start, suggesting a sense of renewal and anticipation for the challenges and joys that lie ahead."
1254	10119	4	3	She would grow some flowers near the bank and ensure fresh water for the geese to encourage them to come back to her pond every year.
1255	10120	4	3	THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THE STORY WITH THAT PARAGRAPH FOR MANY REASONS. One reason being that the author wanted to really show the meaning of the flower, symbolizing perseverance and hope even in difficult circumstances. Another reason is to express the theme. For example at the end of that paragraph it says ìTHEN I WILL TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN,î, its relating that small topic of the driving test to the larger topic of the flower. Which then relates it to the theme of adjusting and keep trying till you adjust, demonstrating resilience in the face of setbacks. That last paragraph was quite vital to the theme and meaning of the story, solidifying the central message of continuous effort and adaptation.
1256	10121	4	3	I believe the author concludes the story ìWinter Hibiscusî, written by Minfong Ho, with ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test againî, because she is trying to show how past memories can be transformed into hope and determination. After failing her driving test Saeng finds the Hibiscus, a familiar plant that reminds her of her native Laos. The memories of her homeland and her grandmother consume her. She buys the plant and puts it in the vegetable garden, a tangible link to her past. After she is done planting, feeling a renewed connection to her roots, Saeng sees a flock of Canada geese fly overhead. Using her memory of her old home and her family, now applied to her new surroundings, Saeng vows to re-take the test, to try again, demonstrating resilience. The author ends the story ìWinter Hibiscusî with that paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up, suggesting that her past provides strength for her future endeavors.
1257	10122	4	3	"The author concludes with this story to show how Saeng is ready to accept her new life. Once the geese and the hibiscus are back she feels like she's at home. When she feels more at home is when she will be ready to take the test again. The text states “if the hibiscus is budding, and the geese return"" then I will take that test again”. Clearly the geese and hibiscus remind her of home, providing a sense of comfort and familiarity in her new surroundings. Once she feels at home, she will feel at ease, less anxious and more confident in her abilities. That's why the author concluded with this passage: to emphasize Saeng's reliance on these symbols of home as indicators of her readiness to face future challenges."
1258	10123	4	3	The author concluded with that paragraph because it restated the story's main idea, ensuring the readers understood the central theme. By summarizing the key elements, the author reinforced the narrative's purpose, leaving the audience with a clear understanding of what the story was ultimately about, thus providing a sense of closure.
1259	10124	4	3	The author explains that she has failed the test. While it is still winter and the hibiscus is still trying to grow it's lovely peddles back. As she tells her mother that she will not take the test again, until the hibiscus starts budding and spring is back, signaling a time of renewal and, perhaps, a fresh start for her as well.
1260	10125	4	3	Yes, I do think that this concludes the story because after all of that in the story and all that learning about gardening from her mother, she remembers what her mother had said about the hibiscus and its budding. And what she means by this ending sentence is that when the springtime comes, then she is going to take that test again. The test will determine whether or not she has learned enough about gardening from her mother over the past time, showing that the cycle of learning and growth will continue.
1261	10126	4	3	The author concludes the Story with this paragraph because I guess her grandma died while the geese were flying, a detail echoed in the somber tone. Or that’s when the flowers start to bloom, signaling a new beginning alongside the grief. The passage likely connects the grandmother's passing to the changing seasons, perhaps symbolizing a cycle of life and death reflected in nature. This juxtaposition of loss and renewal adds a layer of emotional complexity, suggesting the grandma's memory will forever be intertwined with the beauty and transience of the natural world, bringing a bittersweet closure to the narrative.
1262	10127	4	3	"The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî included the last paragraph to convey to readers that she will be moving on, but still remembering her old country. Before finding the flower, the author terribly missed her old country. ""Itís-itís not a real one, ëSaeng mumbled. 'I mean not like the kind we had at-atí she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burst into tears again."" She missed her home in the other country and was having trouble getting past it. The author could not accept her new country as home yet. Saeng, the hibiscus flower brought back memories of her old country, making it even more difficult to move on. One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmotherís long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb."" The flower was too much of a memory. She finally had something from home that she could hold. ìGently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold onto.î The author now had a solid thing to remind her of home, a tangible link to her past. This was the first step to finally moving on. Now Saeng needed some time to get use to her new country. ìAlmost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.î Saeng needed just a little more time, almost like a hibernation. She decided once the hibiscus came out of hibernation, and was ready to bloom, she would be ready to accept her new country and move on. Saeng decide the time between fall and spring would be long enough to adjust to her new life, to witness the changing seasons and find her place within them. By taking the test, Saeng will be moving on. The author included this last paragraph so that readers can infer that Saeng will take the last steps towards acceptance of her new country and move on by taking the test, although she will look back on her old country through the winter hibiscus, a symbol of her enduring connection to her roots even as she embraces her new life."
1263	10128	4	3	The story includes this paragraph because at the very beginning of the story the girl failed the test. And so when she told her mother, she saw that she was upset with it. So after they planted the plant, she decided to take the test over, knowing that her mother would think the best of it. It's also there because the story started out with her telling her mother that she failed the test, and if you kept it out, people who read it would be like, ok, so her mother just let her fail the test and didn't do anything about it. Plus, when the reader reads that the girl failed the test, they are going to be wanting to know if she took it again, and why she took it again if she did, making the resolution more satisfying and complete.
1264	10129	4	3	The author ended the story with an unconcluded ending. What I mean is the author wrote so that he could keep readers interested so that they would want to read his other books. Also, with an ending of that sort it kind of leaves room for improving and room for a sequel, thus creating a lasting connection with the audience and potential for future engagement.
1265	10130	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up until she successfully passes the task her mother gives her. Saeng fails the test because, though she buys a beautiful plant, it is much too expensive. ""But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn't cost that much!"" Saeng becomes very upset and realizes that she has failed her mother's implicit challenge to be both resourceful and appreciative of beauty. Saeng still plants the winter hibiscus in the ground. ""Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the 'winter hibiscus' into it."" This shows that even though she had failed the economic aspect of the task, she wasn’t going to give up on the hibiscus because it represented her home and the beauty she sought to bring into it. It was very special to her, and her dedication to planting it underscores her resilience and determination to keep trying, highlighting her unwavering spirit."
1266	10131	4	3	The Author concludes with that paragraph because she wants to reiterate her central argument. This final section serves to reinforce the key themes explored throughout the piece, ensuring the reader leaves with a clear understanding of the author's perspective. By summarizing the main points, the author effectively drives home the significance of her analysis and leaves a lasting impression. Ultimately, the concluding paragraph aims to solidify the author's message and provide a sense of closure to the discussion.
1267	10132	4	3	I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows that the character in the story is starting to adapt to her new country. In the beginning of the story the character Saeng is feeling homesick and has not adapted to her new country. She is on her way home from her driver’s test, which she just failed, and on the way she spots a hibiscus in a flower shop. The hibiscus is special to her because it reminds her of her home country of Vietnam. For Saeng the hibiscus represents comfort in time of disappointment, connection to her past experiences and ability to overcome obstacles. Saeng has not adjusted to this change in her life and it has affected her badly. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because he wanted to show the reader that there will always be changes and obstacles in your life, but there will always be something or someone that will help you overcome it; the hibiscus serves as a potent reminder of home and resilience. The author shows this by concluding the story with this paragraph, demonstrating that Saeng embodies the hibiscus, symbolizing her way of overcoming challenges, and implying that when she is ready and has adjusted, she will take her driving test again, facing the future with renewed hope and strength.
1268	10133	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he’s saying that once winter and spring’s over and the hibiscus is budding, then I’ll start over again and try again. The author is saying Saeng can’t wait till spring so she can plant her own little garden. This is why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph, highlighting Saeng's resilient spirit and her hopeful anticipation for a new beginning.
1269	10134	4	3	"Saeng planned a year-long transformation, a rebirth in preparation for the test retake. She envisioned becoming a new person by then, shedding old habits and anxieties. Her mother, however, seemed to disapprove of every choice, every step Saeng took towards this goal. Then, a sudden understanding washed over her regarding the hibiscus and its inevitable death, ""... thought the quiet repetition of season upon season."" The flower, like the geese migrating and returning, mirrored her own journey. Through phases of dormancy and renewal, the hibiscus bloomed again, more vibrant than before; Saeng hoped to achieve a similar growth, emerging stronger and better after her own period of change."
1270	10135	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because when she came back from taking her driver's test, she saw a winter hibiscus that was so beautiful. Then, she went to the store and bought those flowers, which cost a lot of money. When she got home, her mom was planting vegetables, and her mom asked her what that was. So she told the truth, and when her mom found out the flower's cost, she got mad at the frivolousness of it all; how could she do that? Saeng makes a big decision that she is going to that event, even though her mom is mad; she loves those flowers, perhaps because they remind her of Vietnam. The author includes this paragraph, I think, because as the geese return and the flowers bloom, she will take the test again. Because when she bought them, no flowers had come out yet, so when they bloom, she will go again, as if to let her know that you see something the first time, and wait for it to grow, then you can try again. In my opinion, that is a good ending and a good question too, as it suggests a cycle of perseverance and hope, tying her personal growth to the natural world.
1271	10136	4	3	"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself...,"" because it offers the reader a conclusion. That passage means that Saeng will try talking her drivers test again once she has adjusted to her new life in a new country. Once she can find familiarity in her surroundings she will feel more at home. Throughout the story, her detachment from Vietnam makes her feel alone. The hibiscus plant is what first offers her a sense of comfort, ""It felt smooth and cool... just as she had known it would feel."" This connection to nature helps ease her transition. The ending paragraph shows that Saeng will find more comfort in her new home than just a plant and a couple of geese, suggesting she will embrace her new life and find her place there."
1272	10137	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when the “snow does melt and the Geese return” it will be time to plant and work in the garden even more. With snow on the ground, planting is impossible, but the return of the geese signifies the right time of year to plant the seed and hopefully have a better flock/harvest and grander garden. The test is to see if she can achieve a better grade than in previous years, signifying successful growth and improvement in her gardening endeavors.
1273	10138	4	3	The author concluded his story with that paragraph is because that's how it should end, and that’s why he ended it like that. It provides a sense of closure and finality suitable for the narrative he crafted, leaving the reader with the intended lasting impression.
1274	10139	4	3	The author concludes the story with ìin the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She does this to show how Saeng is adapting and making decisions in her new country just like she did in her homeland. In Vietnam Saeng used to brush her grandmothers hair and help put it into a bun and put a hibiscus in it. That was one of her traditions with it. Also when she used to get water from the well a hibiscus would sometimes come up with the bucket. Both these thus the hibiscus was seen as a comfort object, now as she is in the states, she is trying to put it to good use, while also taking into account what repeats in the states. She notices that the geese come back in the spring and leave in the winter, and plants start to grow in the spring. By her taking the test again in the spring it is symbolizing that she is ready to start afresh, just like the hibiscus that is going to bloom and mirror her own growth. The plant being potted in her garden and Saeng moving there both signify change, but a remembrance of old traditions, and a space for new.
1275	10140	4	3	The author put that sentence in the story because she feels that will give her enough time to get the test right, since the sentence creates a distraction for the teacher, and because she likes geese.
1276	10141	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the final determination and strength Saeng has been given. It's almost as though it's taken this plant to show her to get back up and pass the test, symbolizing her resilience. The plant becomes a comforting item that reminds her of her homeland and the life she left behind. She returned with the plant to show her mother but found herself too shaky to even say the words ""at home,"" highlighting her continued struggle with displacement. This shows how much she misses home and the familiar comforts it provided. But she is able to realize that this is her new home, a place where she can cultivate new roots, and everything is becoming more familiar to her, suggesting a gradual acceptance and hope for the future."
1277	10142	4	3	She ends it with this sentence because it's a sign of new life. Just as the winter that killed the plants ending life, the spring will come and start anew. This is how Saeng feels because she left her country and all the memories left behind; she feels out of place like the winter hibiscus, but as the spring comes, she’ll feel as a new person, ready and able to take challenges, as she said here, “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” She describes that with a new season comes new changes, and upon those changes she will go on to take the driver's test again, indicating her willingness to embrace the future and integrate into her new environment, finding a sense of belonging through the cyclical nature of life.
1278	10143	4	3	The author ends with that paragraph for several reasons. One is to show that she has failed this time, implying that more opportunities will come later. Also, it shows that even though bad times befall her now, the possibility of good times is still present, offering a sense of hope. For several reasons, it was a powerful and efficient way to end the story, leaving the reader with a feeling of anticipation and the understanding that her journey, though currently stalled, is far from over.
1279	10144	4	3	The author uses symbolism to convey a different message. Saeng said in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, and then I will take that test again. The author uses the hibiscus to symbolize Saeng gets older like the hibiscus, and as it blooms, that then she will be ready to take that test again. The author uses symbolize to convey more of the story's meaning and depth.
1280	10146	4	3	She wrote that response to tell everyone that she will be ready, but by the time when spring comes around next year. Then she will take what she learned and pass the exam, demonstrating her preparedness.
1281	10147	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng wants to start planting again. I know this because Saeng life revolves around planting and FAMILY. Saeng and her mother get there food from what they plant. So all DAY they spend most there time in the garden, growing crops to sell and save. They save for winter and sell to get there equiement to continue whot they do. The part she talking about in the paragraph that say ìwhen they come backî talking about the geese. She loves the geese flying over her head and landing in the yard when she outside on a beauttiful day FAMILY. When The snow melts she wants to get back at in the soil on her hands and knee to start planting again. Once the hibiscus start budding everything else starts growing. Saeng live revolves around DAY planting. The author put this paragraph in the story because this is what Saeng wants to do more than anything, and this reinforces the central theme of renewal and connection to the land that defines her existence.
1282	10148	4	3	In the conclusion of ìWinter Hibiscusî Saeng notes how she will retake her driving test in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return. The spring is when these events occur along with the annual budding of the winter hibiscus. Her family had moved from Minnesota from Vietnam, and she had bought a winter hibiscus plant to remind her of her childhood. When it blooms, she will retake her driving test because the bloom will bring her the hope of a new beginning in her life, and as a citizen in Minnesota.
1283	10149	4	3	In ìWinter Hibiscusî a young girl named Saeng moves away from home. This transition brings many changes as the young girl tries to adapt to the new lifestyle. She misses the familiar comfort of her old surroundings. The new environment presents challenges, and Saeng grapples with feelings of displacement. Despite these difficulties, she shows resilience as she navigates her new reality, holding onto memories while embracing the possibilities ahead. Ultimately, Saeng's journey reveals the universal experience of adjusting to change and finding strength in unfamiliar circumstances, learning and growing with each step.
1284	10150	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants the reader to see that Saeng will not stop until she passes her driver's test, just like the geese won’t stop until they are in the south for winter, driven by an inner need. The author is trying to show the beauty of trying again and going through your obstacles to your goal, highlighting Saeng's resilience and determination. This parallel emphasizes the natural and inevitable nature of pursuing one's aspirations despite setbacks.
1285	10151	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho, the author leaves the story off with a powerful ending. The ending was ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will try the test again"". Basically the author concluded the story with that because it shows she's powerful, that she's willing to try and make herself stronger, that she's willing to try again, and that she wants to help herself. Text examples to prove this would be, ""then I will take the hibiscus test again,"" ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become..."", and ""There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply."" These statements showcase Saeng's resolve to face challenges, her growing understanding of a new culture, and the inner strength she discovers, all backing up why the author might leave such a powerful paragraph for last, emphasizing Saeng's journey of self-improvement and adaptation."
1286	10152	4	3	"The author, in the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" concludes the story with the paragraph to show how often Saeng gets tested by her memories. Saeng was ""tested"" earlier in the story when she was in a florist. Memories come rushing back to her like a flood, and she tried to feel the same as she did long ago when her grandmother was there, and she realized that things in her memories were long gone, so she wept. Saeng reported to her mother that she had failed the test, and bought the plant to try and comfort herself. Her mother was very understanding and accepted it. Saeng planted the hibiscus and at the end says that ""In the spring when the snow melts, this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Saeng knew seeing the flower again would make her cry, would make her memories come back, she will be re-tested, suggesting the cyclical nature of grief and remembrance and her ongoing effort to reconcile her past with her present."
1287	10154	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho, Saeng failed her driver's test that day, then vowed that she would retake it in the spring. She ends with this statement to say that it is a new season and a new beginning for her into her new life. This archetype, the changing from harsh cold winter to nice warm spring time, shows that the troubles her mother and Saeng faced would get better. As the hard trouble of winter left, there is a calm, warm new beginning in spring. Saeng knows this and knows that she is going to pass, embracing the hope and renewal that the season promises."
1288	10155	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for various reasons. For example, the whole passage is talking about how the hibiscus flower provides Saeng with the ability to overcome obstacles, and comfort her in a time of disappointment. This ending paragraph shows that ìin the spring, when the hibiscus is budding,î and the world around her is renewed, then Saeng will take her test again. She knows that with the help of the hibiscus plant, and the resilience it represents, that she will pass the test. It shows that her hope and trust to pass the test comes from the hibiscus flower. The plant with ìwaxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centersî will provide her the strength, determination, courage, and will power to pass the test in the spring, proving that even after setbacks, growth and success are possible.
1289	10156	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author ends with the statement, “...then I’ll take the test again.” This shows that Saeng is willing to try to adapt to this new place she lives in, which is what she refers to when she says “test.” For example, in the story she said, “I-I failed the test,” when her mother asked her what was wrong, indicating her struggle to adjust. She spent so much money on that plant, hoping to stay home in her mind, clinging to a piece of her past. She just couldn’t handle that feeling of displacement. She ends with the positive statement because it sends the message that she looks forward to a bright future in her new home, suggesting a newfound resolve to face the challenges ahead and integrate into her new environment.
1290	10157	4	3	In the story ìWinter Hibiscusî by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons, using examples from the story to illustrate them. One reason is to show the protagonist's resilience. Her statement, ìThen I will take the test again,î reveals her determination and refusal to give up easily. Another reason is to symbolize the hibiscus's potential for adaptation. The phrase ìÖand this hibiscus is budding,î suggests the hibiscus has a chance to adjust to its new environment, mirroring the girl's own journey of adaptation. A final reason is to emphasize her effort and progress. When she says ìshe realized that many of the things that she had thought were strangeÖ, almost familiar to her now,î it highlights her attempts to adapt and her growing comfort. These reasons suggest why the author chose to end the story with that paragraph, as it provides insights into the character's growth and foreshadows a hopeful future.
1291	10158	4	3	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story determined to pass the test after the winter is over and the flower is budding. This shows the connection between the plant and the narrator and the hardships of each. The winter represents an obstacle for the flower, but it will live through it to thrive in the spring. This gives the author confidence that she too can make it through her hardships to thrive. Another hardship that she and the hibiscus both face is being ""root bound."" The author misses her home of Vietnam very much, feeling restricted and out of place in her new surroundings. However, both of them must and will adapt to their new environments, finding the strength to bloom where they are planted, ultimately proving their resilience."
1292	10159	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she misses her home and that affected her driving test. At her home country it was warm, filled with sunshine, and she had all her family memories embedded in the landscape. In the new country it is cold and snowy, something she isn't used to, a stark contrast to the familiar warmth she longs for. It states she will take the test again when all them things happen – when the weather warms and reminds her of home – because it will feel like her home country and she will be more focused on the test and not what she misses, increasing her chances of success.
1293	10160	4	3	The author Minfong Ho concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus” with that certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to pass the driving test and also in a way get used to her new home and adapt to the new culture. It is kind of like a motivation, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The hibiscus flower serves as the motivation, bringing back good memories of people back home that made her happy and believed in her abilities. Minfong also concluded the story the way he/she did to say, by next year Saeng will start fresh, leaving the past behind. To become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past sorrows. Saeng says, “…in the spring…” it’s the beginning of a new year, a chance to start over, and rejoice in the possibilities. This was a really good way to end the story, because it sets a positive vibe, suggesting hope and resilience. It’s letting the readers know that Saeng is a strong person, who can remember the past but move on to a new day and life. And I think the author is trying to point out that everyone should have the strength to do the same, embracing change and finding hope in new beginnings.
1294	10161	4	3	"She ended it with that paragraph because she wanted to prove even though she misses the ""old century,"" with its familiar comforts and traditions, she will adapt and survive. The changing world, while unsettling, doesn't frighten her into inaction. Instead, she acknowledges the necessity of evolving alongside it, demonstrating a resilience that ensures her continued existence and perhaps even a measure of success in the face of progress. This closing statement underscores her determination to not be a relic of the past, but a participant in the future."
1295	10162	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sounds hopeful. She wasn't adapting to her new home very well, and that made her feel hopeless. Saeng failed her driving test, which only made things worse. To make things better, she bought a hibiscus that reminded her of her old home. She found the plant to be very comforting, and it helped her get past the tough times. In the last paragraph, Saeng is looking forward to the spring so she can retake the test and hopefully pass it this time, suggesting a brighter future. I think the paragraph provides a feeling of hopefulness, which is why the author concluded the story the way they did, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism.
1296	10163	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up and there is still hope. It is also to teach the reader to have hope and patience and the knowledge that things take time. Saeng failed the test of not giving into her sorrows and misery of missing her country. She says, ìAlmost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.î This shows that she is adjusting to her new surroundings and way of life, a crucial step in overcoming her initial despair. So by ending it with this and comparing to the geese, who undertake arduous journeys with unwavering determination, it's showing that she is getting stronger, both internally and in her resolve. She will take the test again because she wont give up, indicating a resilience that suggests future success is possible.
1297	10164	4	3	Clearly, from reading the story Winter @CAPS1, the author @CAPS2 uses the phrase “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test Again” in the story because the passage relates to the title of the story Winter @CAPS1, highlighting the contrast between the present hardship and a future hope tied to the changing seasons, offering a sense of perseverance that transcends the current cold and difficulty.
1298	10165	4	3	The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because, even though Saeng didn’t do well on her last test, Saeng will go back and take it again so she can pass it. The author is showing Saeng’s determination to pass the test and do better next time, highlighting her resilient spirit and commitment to achieving her goals despite facing setbacks. This ending emphasizes Saeng's proactive approach and unwavering resolve, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and admiration for her persistence.
1299	10166	4	3	I think the author ends the story with that paragraph because it is linking the plant, which stands for many positive things, to the character that failed the test that they really wanted to pass. Both the character and the plant show perseverance, and I think the author is trying to send a message to the reader to never give up on something you want to accomplish. The plant gives an emblem of perseverance because it survives through the harsh winter. The main character isn’t giving up on the test they want to pass, even with this setback. The author is giving a message not to give up, suggesting that like the resilient plant, the character too can endure and ultimately succeed.
1300	10167	4	3	At the end of the story the author says ìwhen they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again.î The author concludes this at the end because she felt like she didnít do her best, she felt that she failed. So when the spring comes again, a time of renewal and second chances symbolized by the returning geese and blossoming hibiscus, she is going to retry to do it, to take on the challenge again. Hopefully this time, with a fresh start and renewed determination mirroring the rebirth of spring, she will pass.
1301	10168	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Because she wants to come back and do a smell test again when the snow melts and the geese return, hopeful that the thawing earth and returning wildlife might offer a different, perhaps more optimistic, olfactory narrative of the landscape.
1302	10169	4	3	@ORGANIZATION1 is about a girl named Saeng. She is a teenager whose family just moved to the United States from Vietnam. Saeng failed her driving test, and on the walk home, she discovers a beautiful Hibiscus plant and falls in love with it. Saeng's mother has a garden where she is always planting things, using plants and veggies from her garden for dinner. The author concludes a paragraph stating that where the Hibiscus plants are budding in the spring, Saeng will take the test again. Saeng likely says this because she wants to see the beautiful plants when she passes the test, and she thinks seeing the Hibiscus will help her pass the driving test, providing her with a sense of hope and good luck.
1303	10170	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is giving herself hope on passing her test. The hibiscus, a symbol of her home, will have started sprouting, reminding her of resilience and growth. This connection to home and the promise of new beginnings will give her the strength to take the test again and hopefully pass it, all because the winter hibiscus reminded her of the familiar comforts and unwavering support she associates with her roots. This provides a sense of optimism and determination as she faces future challenges.
1304	10171	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph of ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because this paragraph can show that the hibiscus, with its resilience, inspires Saeng to try the test again. If the hibiscus is budding after the snow melts and the geese return, signaling renewal and perseverance, then she can emulate the hibiscus, drawing strength from its blossoming to not give up on her test."
1305	10172	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this to show that Saeng won’t give up. It is possible to adapt and try to love what's around you. Saeng struggled to get out ""I-I failed the test"" and couldn’t say ""at home""; this shows her insecurity and loneliness in the new world around her, and by saying she will try again in the spring gives the reader hope that she will adapt and love her surroundings. She goes through an experience today, contrasting her old life and comparing it to the one she is living in now, revealing some similarities; because she will try again in the spring, it means she has decided to give a new place a chance, ultimately suggesting her resilient spirit and willingness to embrace change."
1306	10173	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she says ""Then I will take that test again""; she believes in the Flowers. She and the Flowers both adapt to their circumstances, being determined to **thrive** in **unlikely** places. They both overcome obstacles. Maybe she wants to see what lays ahead, and she hopes she is right about the Flowers; maybe she likes the spring, suggesting an optimistic outlook and a willingness to face future challenges with renewed hope."
1307	10174	4	3	I actually like the way the author concludes the story with this paragraph. It basically summarizes the story and sums it up into few words that would want you to wonder what happened next, and if there is a sequel. The concise ending leaves you pondering the protagonist's future, hinting at unresolved conflicts or new beginnings. This is a very good story that I personally can relate to in many ways. The themes explored resonate deeply, making the narrative all the more compelling and leaving a lasting impression.
1308	10175	4	3	The reason why the author concludes this type of scenario is simply because the author has a pain to cross and or a situation. In this particular author, you know, son, but if you get it straight you’ll open your eyes and see that it's your time to shine; you might as well grab it before you lose your chance. You only get one day to prove you are worthy to the people, so make that day count.
1309	10176	4	3	The author concludes with this sentence because he is showing the girl's confidence in herself, stemming from her understanding of the natural process. It also gives her enough time to get ready for the next test, allowing her to observe and learn. Also, she knows she will be ready when her flower starts to bud, signifying her own growth and preparedness, which is why the author uses that as a stopping point.
1310	10177	4	3	The author likely concludes the story with that paragraph, focusing on a silent vow and a future story in the spring, to create a sense of hopeful anticipation. The vow suggests a commitment to action or change inspired by the events of the story, while the promise of a spring return hints at a cyclical continuation or resolution of the themes explored. It leaves the reader pondering the possibilities and eager for the unwritten story, providing a satisfying, albeit open-ended, conclusion.
1311	10178	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she was saying that if it is possible for these things to happen then she should be able to take the test and pass it. She was comparing things together that she knew that do not go together. For example she said that in spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then she would take the test over. She meant that if the thing she likes the most overcomes its obstacle then she would do what hurted her the most over again. She doesn’t know if she takes the test over she would keep trying over and over until she passes it. In the story she doesn’t know how to fit in. All she knows is what she learned in her country. All she has to do is try harder and she maybe will be able to pass this test, suggesting that with perseverance and adaptation, she too can overcome her challenges and achieve her goals.
1312	10179	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because when she told her mom she failed her test she was crying. But I think it was deeper than that, perhaps a culmination of homesickness and academic pressure. I think she missed home so much that she couldn't concentrate. She had to cry about something because she didn't want to let her mom know that she misses home, and the test provided a convenient outlet for her emotions.
1313	10180	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author concludes the story because as if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel, a testament to resilience and the enduring cycle of life that mirrored Saeng's own resolve.
1314	10181	4	3	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is showing that the hibiscus inspires her and gives comfort that no person could try and do. For example, after Saeng failed her drivers test, she was disappointed. On her way home she saw a hibiscus and went to a florist shop to try and buy it. Saeng took a petal from the plant and held it tightly while she closed her eyes. The plant reminded her of her real home in Vietnam, with its familiar hibiscus, which she loved. The hibiscus became a form of comfort for Saeng since she had just failed her drivers test, even though the plant was not the same as the one at home. By the author ending the story with Saeng saying she will wait until the hibiscus starts budding to take the test again, it shows that the hibiscus helps her to overcome obstacles in life and it helps her to get through hardships she faces, ultimately offering her a sense of hope and connection to her past.
1315	10182	4	3	What Saeng means at the end of the paragraph is that when it is a season for those plants, she will take the test again. The test is designed to help her begin to like the plot, including the features and characters, as well as the history of these plants, ensuring a more favorable outcome.
1316	10183	4	3	She is demanding to not take the test again if the winter hibiscus don't come back; she was upset that she had failed the test. She spent most of her day looking at the hibiscus, searching for a comforting reminder of home, but she was still upset that they weren't the real ones back at home. Her mother, noticing her distress, said they are strong enough to make it through the winter. When they come back in the spring, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, finding strength in their resilience.
1317	10184	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it symbolizes the hope that things will get better. The author ends with hope because the flower symbolizes the girl and the girl saying that if the flower can survive the year, so can she. This symbolizes hope because the girl is realizing that it is going to take time before she can adapt to her new country, but eventually she will. This is meaningful because the girl considers the day that she had to be horrible and that this statement ends the day on a good note, suggesting a brighter future. The girl spends the entire day wishing that she were back in her own country and missing her grandmother and friends, feeling isolated and out of place. But this paragraph is the girl vowing a promise to herself that she will withstand the winter until spring, a promise of resilience, and it will get better when she can take the test again. The entire story builds up to this turning point when Saeng realizes that she will make it through this struggle just like this flower will make it through the winter, showing her newfound determination. Saeng realizes that it is going to take time for her to adapt to this new and strange country and the new lifestyle that she must adopt, but she is now willing to face the challenge.
1318	10185	4	3	"The author concludes this story with this sentence, because it shows hope for the future. This sentence lets readers know that times are hard now, but in time things will get better. Saeng might have failed this test, but she's not giving up hope on passing it. She believes she will pass that test in the spring, when the time is right and conditions are more favorable. Saeng might miss her home, but she won't let that interfere with her future. That is why the author concludes the story with ""when they comeback, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that tests again,"" showcasing her resilience and determination for a brighter future."
1319	10186	4	3	What the author is talking about is that the snow was melting and spring is coming. I guess what they mean is that flowers, trees and grass are going back to being beautiful. Also he was letting us know that spring is here and that it is not winter anymore. That's why she starts to plant plants in the winter, so in the spring they can grow out to be nice and beautiful. That's what I think the author meant, and that's the reason why he put that in the paragraph. More details, like how the plants and stuff were growing so beautifully, could have been added to let us know what was being discussed in the paragraph. The inclusion of these details would have definitely enhanced the reader's understanding.
1320	10187	4	3	"The author chose to end the story in this way because it effectively ties in different aspects and principles of the story. For example, this sentence includes both the geese and the hibiscus, representing her new home, and the old, together in harmony. It also states that ""... Saeng vowed silently to herself... I will take that test again,"" which relates to the determination of the hibiscus flower, which struggles persistently through the winter. A lot of wisdom can be gathered from the symbolic messages hidden within that final sentence. It implies that, though the past may be behind you, it is with you in your heart as you face new challenges, and if you are determined, those challenges can be conquered, ultimately suggesting that resilience and remembering one's roots are key to overcoming future obstacles."
1321	10188	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they because it shows Saeng's determination and her overcoming her obstacles of being new in a country. With all of the doubts Saeng had right after her test, it is very big of her to come to this conclusion of retaking the test, “Here, let me help you mother,” she offered (HO). With her mom comforting her and telling her it is okay, gives Saeng the boost she needs to help her mother and think to herself that she can’t let just one thing hold her back in life. The support Saeng has, she will definitely pass the test the next time, showcasing her resilience and newfound confidence in her ability to succeed.
1322	10189	4	3	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author Minfong Ho ends with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She ended with this to show her determination to do good in her new country and show that memories of her grandmother help her to strive for the best in her new home. In the beginning of the story Saeng is at a flower shop and she sees all the flowers of her home country growing in pots. At the sight of all these flowers, memories flood back to her, memories that bring her both joy and sadness. Then when she returns home she tells her mother that she failed the test; you can tell from her actions that she is disappointed, “I-I failed the test,” Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye, nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits.” After a while she planted the hibiscus flower in the vegetable garden. The buying and planting of the flower shows that Saeng wants to remember her grandmother and her home country. Thinking about her grandmother helps her strive for better, helps her want to succeed in her new home. Memories of her grandmother make her sad but in a way also make her happy, fueling her resolve to try again and succeed."
1323	10190	4	3	The author concludes the story this way with a quote that says she will get another try at something, a choice that leaves the future open. Many authors end stories differently to encourage the reader to seek out a sequel or the next installment, adding a compelling twist to the ending. Another reason an author might choose this type of ending is to spark the reader's imagination, prompting them to envision what happens next. Using this technique can be effective because the reader understands the events that have transpired, and it makes them wonder whether the character will fail or succeed in their next attempt, leaving a lasting impression.
1324	10191	4	3	"The author closes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is willing to try again. Even though it might not be right away, Saeng wants to try to see all of the flowers that remind her of home again without breaking down. She can tell that although her mother is understanding, Saeng has let her down a little bit. ""But how could you? You know how much we—what happened?"" when her mother says this, she feels that she has let her mother down. But then, Mrs. Panouvong expresses that she is glad Saeng got it, after hearing that she had failed to identify the flowers. Sensing her mother's inkling of disappointment mixed with relief, Saeng wants to try again, motivated by a desire to fulfill her mother's unspoken wishes and conquer her own emotional barriers."
1325	10192	4	3	Most likely the author concludes this story with that paragraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng was a very determined person. The author wanted to show readers that Saeng was a strong character because throughout the story she seemed very determined to pass the test for the first time, studying diligently and sacrificing other activities. But when she failed, the author wanted to show that Saeng was not going to give up hope and that she was going to take the test again, demonstrating her resilience and unwavering commitment to achieving her goal, which ultimately paints a picture of her persistent nature.
1326	10193	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides insight into her perspective. You gain a view of her message and can better understand it through the lens of her upbringing, as she mentions, for example, experiences that shaped her understanding.
1327	10194	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because he is making a point about immigration. The point the author is making is that when immigrants came to America they were told to forget where they were from . The word test in the story means getting used to America and forgetting her homeland. Saeng says those words because she failed the test and bought something that reminded her of her homeland. In conclusion the Author is describing how immigrants were treated and told to forget who they were because their in America now."
1328	10195	4	3	In the story “Winter @CAPS1,” the author was trying to say that Saeng was from somewhere other than where he is now. In the text, it says, “It was like walking into another world,” so he is there thinking like nobody knows him except for him and him only. He likely feels isolated and disconnected from his past, as if he has stepped into a completely unfamiliar environment. This sense of alienation underscores the author’s point that Saeng’s origins are distant from his current reality, emphasizing the profound shift in his surroundings and social connections.
1329	10196	4	3	The author concludes this story with that paragraph because it shows signs of hope and that knowing that spring will come again. For the family, the harsh winter, both literal and metaphorical, will eventually thaw, and everything will be ok. For them also, there's the promise of renewal. The girl will make friends also when spring comes, suggesting a brighter, more socially connected future for her. This cyclical return of spring offers a comforting resolution, implying resilience and eventual happiness after hardship.
1330	10197	4	3	In ìWinter Hibiscusî Saeng took her driverís test and failed it. She wants to try and take it again in the spring. I think she ends the story saying that because in the spring the hibiscus plant that she got and her and her mom planted, will be growing and blooming and the geese will be back, which makes her feel more at home. That way she will feel comfort and be able to take the test and pass, because it will remind her of being home. The return of spring, signaled by the blooming hibiscus and the migrating geese, symbolizes a sense of renewal and belonging for Saeng in her new country, and this connection to home will give her the confidence she needs.
1331	10198	4	3	In the end of the story they say that she will take the test over again, in the spring when the geese come back from the winter fly. What they are saying is that she will make a fresh start in the spring when the geese come back, so she would just be starting all over again fresh new start to a new year and a new time to study for the big test and time to regroup from the last test that she took and failed the test she will just get a new start and a new chance to do something over again. Her mom was in disbelief when she found out that she failed the test, her mom said to her that it will be ok and you can take it over again, in a new season. This offers a symbol of hope, as the return of the geese signifies renewal and a chance to try again, providing a sense of comfort after the initial disappointment.
1332	10199	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is thinking what it will be like when all of this happens. Saeng said; ìwhen they come back, she vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She pictures the scene vividly, the thawing earth, the familiar honking overhead, and the vibrant promise of new life mirroring her own renewed determination. This cyclical imagery emphasizes not just hope, but a commitment to perseverance in the face of past setbacks, a quiet promise whispered to herself and the returning season.
1333	10200	4	3	The author of the story concludes the text with that paragraph to end on a good note and show hope for the future. First, throughout the story Saeng felt lonely and depressed because she missed her home in Vietnam. The cultural adjustment proved difficult, and she longed for familiar sights and sounds. With all this depression Saeng saw the winter hibiscus that reminded her of her childhood memories. The vibrant flower sparked a sense of connection to her past and provided a small comfort. She felt a little hope for adapting to the new environment and new life. The flower represented the light and hope for the future. Next, it shows perserverance factor in the story Saeng fails her drivers test and came home feeling unacomplished. This setback added to her feelings of inadequacy and frustration. When she says she will retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus blooms it shows perserverance and never giving up. She uses the flower as a symbol of renewed hope and determination to succeed. Lastly, the author ended the passage with that paragraph to end on a good note and show a positive outlook on life. No matter where you come from with love and perserverance you can overcome any obstacle. Whether it be your school, tests or home with a little hardwork and faith you can achieve anything you set your mind to.
1334	10201	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to show that she will do this once she has grown more comfortable in her new country. When she says, “When the geese return,” their faint honks and flying overhead are familiar to her now, season upon season, providing a sense of belonging. Also, when the hibiscus is budding because this will remind her of her home in Vietnam; seeing the flower and hearing these geese will give her the confidence and encouragement needed to retake the driver's test, signifying her growing adaptation and resolve.
1335	10202	4	3	Saeng vowed silently to herself because she had difficulty making new friends. She liked to plant stuff around her because she felt like plants were her friends, offering a silent companionship she understood. Saeng took the shovel and finished the planting for her mom, a task that made Saeng feel so good about herself, boosting her confidence and sense of purpose.
1336	10203	4	3	The author of ìWinter Hibiscus ìdecided to end the story with this paragraph because it's like a new beginning for Saeng. In Saeng moves and fails the test. The winter hibiscus comforts her from the memories of where she used to live. It gives her hope, and in the winter it wouldnít be as nice as it would be in the spring. Spring is also a time for new beginnings because in the winter everything dies and comes back to life in spring. Saeng feels she would take the test as a new beginning. The mention of spring suggests optimism for her future endeavors. From my personal experience I always do spring cleaning because I want to begin fresh. Spring is also filled with fresh air and gives me inspiration to do good. This could be why Saeng wants to take the test in the springtime. Therefore, the author of ìWinter Hibiscus ìdecided to end the story with that paragraph because they wanted to show how Saeng wanted a new beginning and the potential that spring holds for her future.
1337	10204	4	3	"Authors sometimes conclude a story with a certain paragraph describing an action that will take place in the future. In the story ìWinter Hibiscusî the author concludes the paragraph by saying ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î One reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to help show that things will change come spring. For example in the story the girl saids ìI-I failed the test.î By her saying this and talking about how she failed her driving test come spring she can change. She can get better, so that this time she will pass. Also, ìThe ""winter hibiscusî was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.î This quote helps show that the hibiscus is being planted now, but come spring it will have changed color and have bloomed, showing growth and transformation mirroring Saeng's own potential. In conclusion authors end stories with a paragraph like this to help show the changes that could happen in the future."
1338	10205	4	3	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The ìbudding hibiscusî symbolizes comfort for her. When moving to @LOCATION1 she couldnít take all her friends and possessions with her, but she could bring memories. The flower reminds her of home, which is comforting after she failed her drivers test. In addition, the ìgeese returningî symbolizes a new beginning. After being away for so long, the geese returning ushers in spring, a time to start all over after a dreary winter. Finally, ì...then I will take that test againî emphasizes that one should never give up. Even though it was hard for her to adapt to a new country, she made friends and tried @CAPS2 foods, like a Big @CAPS3. Therefore, Minfong Ho concludes the story with the paragraph to show comfort, new beginnings, and that one should never give up on their goals despite facing setbacks.
1339	10206	4	3	The reason why the author wanted to put that last paragraph down because they want to keep the reader interested in the story. Another reason why she put that in the story; it is letting the reader know that the plant will never give up. By ending on that note, the author ensures the reader remembers the plant's resilience.
1340	10207	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the quote, ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to show that she is encouraged by the memories of her homeland. For example, in the story it stated that she realized that many things were similar to things in her homeland, like the resilience of nature mirroring her own. As the seasons went by she discovered the similarities. The spring time, a season of rebirth and growth, reminded Saeng of her home, so when it comes she will be motivated to take the test again. In conclusion, the author included the quote to show how she is encouraged by memories of her homeland, suggesting that the connection to her roots provides the strength she needs to persevere."
1341	10208	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the main character vowing to take the drivers test again to symbolize moving forward. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so infuse, it was almost visceral. Upon stumbling to a florist shop, the main character sees a flower that reminded her of her homeland, Vietnam. ""Here, let me help, mother."" In relieving her mother in the task of planting the seed that she had bought, she began to mature. After reflecting on the memories of her past and coming to peace with them, there was nothing left stopping her from moving forward. ""When they come back, I will take that test again."" As she sees geese migrating south for the winter in a v formation, she sets a goal for herself and uses that goal as a tool to help herself grow and move forward in the new country she's in. The main character vowing in ""Winter Hibiscus"" symbolizes moving forward, representing her acceptance of her new life and her determination to integrate fully."
1342	10209	4	3	It shows in this time of doubt that she will overcome. In the story, the small, resilient plant showed hope with its persistent growth, and in showing this, gave her hope as well. All the memories that she recalled, initially filled with the pain of loss, had made her sad at first, but in the end, recognizing the love within them, gave her hope for the future. This newfound strength suggests she will indeed find her way forward.
1343	10210	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that statement simply because, maybe he is trying to send out some sort of message to people and get their attention. The author also could have concluded the story off with that statement because maybe he just felt like he needed to do that, maybe he didn't have a particular reason for doing it. Ultimately, the author's intent remains open to interpretation, and the ending may simply reflect a stylistic choice.
1344	10211	4	3	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take the test again"" because it's sympathizing Saeng's ability to overcome her sorrow and give the test another chance. This is symbolized by when she says ""when the geese return and the hibiscus."" After failing the test, she wasn't even considering retaking the test, but instead, just wished she could return to her old home and not have to think about it. But much like the geese returning in the spring, she says she will retake the test. She is like the geese because they overcome and adapt to the cold, harsh weather by flying elsewhere and returning when it's warm; like her, she must wait until she is more ready and confident to take the test the second time around. The Hibiscus budding is symbolizing her strength and determination to pass the test the second time she takes it, because just like her the hibiscus survives the cold weather months and bloom in the spring, so must she last through the winter to pass in the spring. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that she hasn't given up and will take the test again, assured that she will pass."
1345	10212	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator wants to retake the test and is waiting for a better time, perhaps when she feels more prepared and life is less chaotic. It shows that she has perseverance and will not give up on passing this test, demonstrating her determination. She realizes that life comes and goes very quickly, emphasizing the fleeting nature of time. And that she needs to appreciate it, suggesting a newfound awareness of the present moment and a desire to make the most of future opportunities.
1346	10213	4	3	"The author concluded the last paragraph in the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" to say that the narrator ""Saeng"" isn’t given up on her driving test, implying a resilience and determination despite previous setbacks. This suggests that she will likely continue to pursue her goal of obtaining a driver's license, viewing it as an important step towards independence and assimilation. Thus, Saeng's journey, though challenging, reflects her unwavering spirit."
1347	10214	4	3	"At the end of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author's concluding paragraph showcases many aspects of the story in a summary. Saeng is determined to go back to the driver's test and is open to a new beginning. The author used these concluding words to express the hope in Saeng for a better beginning and to show her determination to pass the driver's test. The author ties objects in the story to represent this determination and new beginning. For example, the hibiscus reminds her of her glorious home, spring is the time she picks because it symbolizes renewal, and the returning geese mirror her determination to resolve to become new and better, highlighting her resilience in adapting to a new life."
1348	10215	4	3	The author Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph to evoke hope within the reader towards the characters in the story. One of the most important lessons anyone can learn in life is to never lose hope because things will get better so long as you try. Though Saeng was sad over failing her driving test and missed her homeland deeply, with ending the story and this paragraph, the principal that “never giving up is important” is presented and carried out hopefully through the character's vow to keep trying. This principal presents the idea that people can overcome hard times in their life no matter what circumstances they are presented with. In conclusion, hope is evoked within the reader because of the ending paragraph which contributes to the overall theme of the entire story; it is important to never give up and always have hope, especially when life gets hard, ensuring a positive takeaway for the reader.
1349	10216	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sounds better and it makes the story sound a bit more better when the author put that paragraph in the start. If the author did not put that ending at the end of the story the story probably wouldnt be that intresting and be that good of a story if the author didnít put that ending paragraph at the end of the story. Also the author wants to make the reader understand the story end end or the start all at the same time. For example if there were no good ending at the end of this story no body would want to read at all not a bit so it was a good thing for the author to put a good end stable ending paragraph at the end of the story. I think ic it was a very good paragraph for the end of the story, especially since it provides closure. It just really seemed to mach the story and I could also really understand it a lot better because of the ending paragraph, solidifying the narrative's purpose. It was just the perfect ending for this story, bringing everything together in a satisfying way.
1350	10217	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to explain to us that this plant is going to bring good luck. The snow will melt, the geese will return and the hibiscus plant will start budding. It's starting over fresh, a new beginning, and the hibiscus, despite the winter, will bloom again. Since she had failed her driving test she will start over in the spring, mirroring the plant's resilience and promise of renewal. In conclusion this is why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
1351	10218	4	3	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is pretty much to say in the spring when the plant starts over Saeng will start over too. The story shows that this is the meaning because Saeng was having a really hard winter, feeling lost and out of place, and was having a hard time adjusting to all of the new things, but in the spring she can start over just like the hibiscus will, putting down new roots and blossoming in her new environment, suggesting a hopeful future for Saeng as she adapts and thrives.
1352	10219	4	3	The author includes this paragraph for many reasons. One reason is because the story starts by depicting Saeng failing her driver's test and feeling depressed. The narrative then shifts to the hibiscus, a plant that evokes cherished memories of her homeland and positive experiences. This paragraph connects to everything because Saeng resolves to postpone retaking the test until the hibiscus, a symbol of her happiness and confidence, begins to bud again. Therefore, that paragraph is directly relevant to every aspect of the story, linking her initial disappointment to her eventual hope and determination.
1353	10220	4	3	I think the author concludes this in the story because when they come back from their journey and the character has gained new experiences and perspectives, is when she feels she would be prepared to take that test again, demonstrating growth and a readiness that was previously absent.
1354	10221	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasise the theme that changes in life are hard to adjust to. Saeng has moved to @LOCATION1 and longs for home. The flowers in the greenhouse remind her of where she grew up and her grandmother. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" Saeng cannot look at the flowers without crying. She tells her mom that she did not pass the test, but in the last paragraph she vowed to herself that by spring she will. The author is giving us insight to Saeng's character, showing that even though it is difficult for Saeng to let go of what she knows and loves, she possesses the inner strength to adapt and eventually make a life for herself in a new world."
1355	10222	4	3	The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show us that her days with nature are not yet over, for when the seasons come back around, she will continue to do what she has been doing, which was nurturing her plants, carefully tending to them, even raising them to become a goodnight dinner, and to continue that cycle until she is no longer able to do so. This cyclical return emphasizes a continuing connection to nature, suggesting a commitment that extends into the future.
1356	10223	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because the author is showing how she feels more comfortable with her old home. The winter hibiscus is related to her new home, but when winter is gone and new hibiscus came, they relate to her new home. The hibiscus from her old home give her a sense of comfort, reminding her of familiar surroundings and cherished memories. So, when she feels that comfort again, she will be brave and go take the test, feeling more grounded and secure. The author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng still doesn’t like the change and would like to go back to her old home, suggesting that her heart still belongs to the place where she felt most at ease.
1357	10224	4	3	"The author includes this paragraph because Saeng is starting anew in a new country. In this country she misses her homeland, and the hibiscus reminds her so much of it. Saeng took a test and failed, and in the winter, flowers fail, but they bloom again in the spring. When the hibiscus blooms, Saeng will ""bloom"" and try the test again, holding onto the promise of renewal. Moving can be a hardship, especially when it is to a place very unfamiliar. People find ways to make themselves promises and to remind them of their old home, finding strength in familiar symbols like the hibiscus to persevere through challenges."
1358	10225	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because this spring she had made a mistake, like buying the plants that were over @MONEY1 (dollars), and her mother was disappointed with her. So she figures that when the spring comes again, she could get another opportunity to do her best and to get it right this time. Also, so she will not be a disappointment to her mother, she anticipates the chance for redemption and a fresh start with the next season.
1359	10226	4	3	The author ended the story with that paragraph because she said that the flower helps her with the moving and reminds her of her home town, offering a sense of connection to what she knows. When the geese come back and the flower starts to bloom, she’ll know that she can pass that test, symbolizing a renewed sense of hope. She is sad for failing the test, but it doesn’t matter how many times you fail, because sooner or later you will pass the test. She must feel comfortable taking the test again when spring comes along, as the flower serves as a comforting reminder and source of encouragement, allowing her to approach the challenge with renewed optimism.
1360	10227	4	3	I believe that the author concluded the story ìWinter @CAPS1î with the paragraph that she did in order to imply that Saeng will not give up. By allowing the audience to know that Saeng was very sad about failing the test, but will take the test again infers that Saeng is a determined person, unwilling to let a setback define her. It is my belief that the concluding paragraph was added to convey the feeling that Saeng was determined despite hardships, suggesting a resilience that will guide her future endeavors.
1361	10228	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes the story with, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt. and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again'' because the hibiscus represents hope and adapting to circumstances. Saeng is trying to adapt to the new changes in her life but nothing is working out for her. ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst in to tears again."" @CAPS2 the Hibiscus makes her life easier because it reminds her of her homeland and her family, @CAPS3 it gives her hope, ""look how root-bound it is, poor thing,"" the root-bound represents Saeng in her new country. Unwilling to try anything, and getting scared but as soon as Saeng and her mother plant the hibiscus, Saeng realizes that by planting it, she is going to try to love her new life in @LOCATION1 America, and in spring when the hibiscus and Saeng is ready to blossom, she will start trying to accept life. It signifies that just like the hibiscus, she too can adapt and thrive."
1362	10229	4	3	Mingfong Ho closes the story with that paragraph because it shows how far Saeng has come and her determination to persevere. The narrator says, ìShe lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly facing into the distance ì(Ho @NUM1). This is when Saeng is recovering from crying and even though she misses her homeland, she wants to adapt and succeed where she is now. The narrator also said, ìshe found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears againî (Ho @NUM1). Being away from her homeland makes Saeng very homesick, but her resolve to move forward is evident. The final image of the geese flying away symbolizes her own journey and her commitment to building a new life, despite the lingering pain of leaving her past behind, ultimately demonstrating her strength and resilience.
1363	10230	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they feel that the plant will bring them luck or something. Saeng feels that the plant gives her some type of comfort. After all the hardships she's faced, nurturing this small life provides a sense of hope and a tangible connection to growth and resilience, and this connection offers a quiet solace.
1364	10231	4	3	I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph because in the story, the author says “through the quiet repetition of season upon season” which means that seasons will come and seasons will go, but she’ll always be there, ready to “take the test,” suggesting an enduring commitment and acceptance of her role within the cyclical nature of life.
1365	10232	4	3	The author is probably trying to say in the spring when the seasons change, the snow melts, and the geese return, filling the air with their honking calls, and the hibiscus is budding, promising vibrant color, he will take the test again. Therefore, he will attempt the test again when the time is right.
1366	10233	4	3	The author concludes that failing the test is not the worst thing. She realizes that times change and you can always get another chance, which is explained in the last paragraph that once the hibiscus buds bloom, signaling warmer weather and new beginnings, she will take the test again. This signifies her acceptance of the setback and her renewed hope for future success. Therefore, she understands that life offers multiple opportunities for growth and achievement.
1367	10234	4	3	...The author conclude the story with her saying in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, a symbol of resilience against the harsh winter, then I will take that test again, better prepared and with a stronger resolve, determined to show myself that I will not gust out like that.
1368	10235	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph. It means so many things about her in just one little sentence. For example ""take that test again"" she willing to do it all over again; she loves it and wants to do it. Also when she said ""in spring; when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" from that, it suggests that when you come back, don't forget about all the things she just listed. That's why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, encapsulating her resilient spirit and her connection to the cyclical beauty of nature, emphasizing a return and remembrance."
1369	10236	4	3	This story about believing in yourself and never giving up is a story about perseverance. Saeng really believed she could pass her driver's test, and although she was disappointed with the result, she found a way to cope with her loss. The hibiscus flower means a lot to her because she can connect it to her homeland, and it is a thing of beauty, something she needed at such an ugly time for her. It's always hard to adapt to a new country in a short period of time, especially with the added pressure of everyday tasks. I know what it's like when one small thing goes wrong; it can feel like the end of the world. You can snap and it will feel a lot worse than it actually is, making you feel helpless and alone, just like the hibiscus growing next to the highway in the photo, seemingly out of place. Saeng vowed to take her driverís test again when her hibiscus would bloom in the spring; I think the hibiscus really symbolizes Saeng as a person, resilient and beautiful, even in a harsh environment, offering hope for a brighter future.
1370	10237	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. Saeng was disappointed for failing her driving test, but this feeling is temporary. She found comfort with nature after she went and bought a plant, nurturing it as a way to cope. Saeng must feel that when the geese leave and the hibiscus has not started to bud, it is not her time, and she should not take the drivers test then. She feels comforted by the return of the geese and budding of the hibiscus, associating these natural events with good fortune. This implies nature comforts her and gives her hope. The author ended it like this because it shows Saeng is not as disappointed about failing anymore. She knows she will have another chance next year when the geese return and the hibiscus starts to bud again. With the comfort of nature, she feels she can pass the test next year, finding solace and renewed determination in the cyclical rhythm of the natural world.
1371	10238	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph or quote to get the readers something to think about at the end of the reading. For example, it lets the reader know that the person will continue to grow plants when the winter is done, suggesting a cycle of hope and renewal even after a period of hardship. This lingering thought encourages reflection on the enduring nature of perseverance.
1372	10239	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng's growing determination. Saeng is having problems with both adjusting and adapting to the changes in her new life, especially her struggle with English. We see an example of this when Saeng comes home with her flower, ""she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again,"" highlighting her vulnerability. We see that Saeng bought the flower because it made her feel secure, reminding her of Laos. It was something from home that felt familiar to her, a small piece of her past in a foreign land, and I believe that's why Ho concluded the story with this paragraph: next year, Saeng will likely approach the test with a greater sense of security and familiarity because she will have gained experience, making her more resilient."
1373	10240	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up, demonstrating her resilience. She also concludes with this to tell people that they should never give up and that they should keep on trying, even when facing obstacles. Even if they have to take a break to study or rethink the plan, perseverance is key, and Saeng's example serves as an encouragement to persist through challenges and ultimately pursue their goals with renewed determination.
1374	10241	4	3	"When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, ""In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author included this paragraph to show her determination to improve her grades, marking the passing seasons as a period of renewed effort and focused study before her next attempt."
1375	10242	4	3	He ends the paragraph with this because he is implying he would prefer the experience of retaking the test on a nicer day. Therefore, in conclusion, this is why the author ends it with that sentence.
1376	10243	4	3	"At the end of the short story, ìWinter Hibiscusî, the writer Minfong Ho includes a somewhat inspirational concluding sentence: ìwhen they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.î I think this sentence was added in order to create a sense of hope for the future, which contrasts so greatly with the depressing nature of the story, creating a happy ending. Throughout the essay, Saeng is depressed she had to leave her homeland so hurriedly, losing her childhood and beloved grandmother, ìA blink, a channed switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone.î as Saeng narrates in deeper detail. Also contributing to the feelings of sorrow in the story is how much Saeng cries remembering her tragic past in both the greenhouse, recalling the events of her grandmother such as when she says, ìSaeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmotherís grey hair Saeng would help knot the hair the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it,"" and in the garden, when she talks to her mother and plants the flower. The hibiscus, a symbol of her former life, offers a tangible link to her memories. After all this sorrow, by putting in a hopeful ending, the writer has successfully allowed a sense of hope for the future."
1377	10244	4	3	"She says, ""Ignoring the spring, I will take the test again,"" because she knows if she fails the test again, her mother will be disappointed in her for not trying hard enough, or maybe they, too, will never be closer again. The mother thinks she keeps failing the test because of her connection to her past experiences or affection for her new country and ability to overcome obstacles. Finally, I think she is comforted by memories of her homeland. Therefore, she chooses to focus on the task at hand, suppressing the comfort of the past in order to succeed in the present and mend her relationship with her mother."
1378	10245	4	3	The author concludes the story with that quote for one main reason: it shows that the girl has hope. In a story, one of the best qualities a character can have is hope because it makes the reader interested and helps provide a good morale for the story, suggesting a possibility of a better future despite current hardships. That is why the author concludes the story with that quote, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism.
1379	10246	4	3	The author of this story created the last paragraph so that it finishes the story with a great ending, emphasizing the fact of never giving up and trying again. The author said, “I will take the test again.” In the story, Saeng said, “I failed the test,” but now she isn't giving up. This last paragraph makes a lot of sense and is needed to make this story complete, showcasing her resilience. So, just as others don't give up in @LOCATION1, Saeng is doing the same and is retaking the test, showing her determination to succeed.
1380	10247	4	3	The author concludes the story with ìwhen they come back, Saeng wowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test againî, because he wants to express to the readers that she is willingly determined for what she has to do to accomplish what she has failed. Since she has failed the test the first time, experiencing the sting of disappointment, she wants to overcome her failure and succeed. The imagery of the returning geese, melting snow, and budding hibiscus symbolizes a time of renewal and new beginnings, mirroring Saeng's own resolve to try again. Therefore, the author wants her to look determined in the end, embracing the challenge with a renewed spirit.
1381	10248	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes the story longer and it gives it a good ending, providing a sense of closure that the reader might find satisfying. This final paragraph might extend the narrative slightly, adding detail or resolution. The author should elaborate on how specifically the ending is ""good,"" perhaps by pointing to elements of thematic resonance or character development that are finalized in that concluding section, not leaving the interpretation entirely to the reader."
1382	10249	4	3	The plant was important to Saeng because it was from her homeland. Saeng said that she would take her driver's test again when her plant bloomed. The plant was a reminder of her homeland and what she came from, a tangible link to her past. The plant to Saeng was a form of confidence, a symbol of hope and resilience. Saeng went through hard times and the plant was close to her because it was from her homeland, offering her comfort and strength during challenging periods, serving as a potent symbol of connection and perseverance.
1383	10250	4	3	"I believe the author ended the story with that paragraph to create a sense of wonder. I think this because if you put into context the word ""test,"" it could mean many things. For example, it could mean the test to overcome the sadness of her situation after leaving her old life behind. Also, it could mean the test to adjust to her new home and surroundings when the spring comes, bringing unfamiliar changes. That is why I think the author tried to create a sense of wonder with the final paragraph, leaving the reader to ponder the possibilities and uncertainties of the future."
1384	10251	4	3	The story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, is about overcoming adversity. She concludes the story by writing “when they come back [the geese] then I will take that test.” The main character, Saeng, had been having trouble at school and on her way home had seen an assortment of flowers that were indigenous to her homeland. “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense it was almost painful.” The sight of those flowers namely the hibiscus reminded her of what she lost and offered comfort in the face of the memory. The winter hibiscus could still survive even though it was not in the land where it belonged. Her mother states “It’s flowers aren’t as pretty but it’s strong enough. That’s what counts.” Saeng , after hearing this, decides that she could be strong, too, and would try to do her best in school. She would adapt just like the winter hibiscus, drawing strength from her heritage to face her challenges. This realization gave her the resolve to persevere and demonstrates the story's theme of resilience.
1385	10252	4	3	She said that because she was more interested in flowers than a test, specifically the way the sunlight illuminated the delicate petals of the newly bloomed roses in the garden outside the window. This distraction, she confessed with a sigh, made concentrating on quadratic equations nearly impossible, thus explaining her lack of preparedness. Ultimately, her passion lay in observing nature's beauty, overshadowing her academic obligations.
1386	10253	4	3	I believe that the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows the ending of one thing and the beginning of another. After she is upset and thinks about home, recalling familiar comforts perhaps, she realizes that something new is happening and she needs to accept it. So therefore in the spring, a time traditionally associated with rebirth, she is going to start new like the flower blossom, embracing the changes and opportunities that lie ahead. This symbolic connection to spring suggests a hopeful outlook, signifying her willingness to move forward and flourish in her new circumstances.
1387	10254	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants to get the point out that the character doesn't want to rush into things; she wants to do right and not take the quick way out. It highlights her commitment to a deliberate and thoughtful approach, suggesting a preference for integrity over expediency, thus solidifying her character as someone who values the process as much as the outcome.
1388	10255	4	3	It shows the importance of the Hibiscus to Saeng and her dedication to the flower, as she carefully tends to it each day. It is also stating that she will wait for next spring to admire the flower again, patiently anticipating its vibrant bloom after the long winter months.
1389	10256	4	3	The author ends this story with this paragraph because she is explaining her thoughts and why she is taking that test, a placement exam that will determine her academic path. She is explaining that next year, after experiencing the classes and the environment, she will find out if this school, this new beginning, feels like home to her. Ultimately, the test is a step towards finding her place.
1390	10257	4	3	When the author concluded the narrative by when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take test again demonstrates the ability to overcome obstacles, finding comfort in a time of disappointment, and her connection to her past experiences. First, it demonstrates the ability to overcome obstacles because there are obstacles in everyone's lives, and you don't have a choice but to conquer them because they are unlimited. So the hibiscus flower represents the obstacles, and the weather represents time because weather is stopping the flower from blooming. Secondly, it also represents finding comfort in a time of disappointment because when you have gone through an obstacle, you would find disappointment lingering there. However, she knows that the hibiscus will be coming back, and she has the awareness of the obstacles coming back, which give her hope. Finally, it asserts her connection to her past experience because she is trapped in a world that she is not familiar with, which would make her feel like an alien. She captures the sense of being out of place, because you can relate that the hibiscus flower could be her because she feels eccentric and different from the rest of the people in her environment; she is trying to adapt her way of living and trying to survive in the world, like when she was in her own country, highlighting her resilience and determination.
1391	10258	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it represents Saeng's determination and her present situation. Having just arrived in a new country, she hasn't adjusted yet. She was disappointed, like ""shaft of the war afternoon starlight."" ""War"" shows Saeng was very upset. After she saw the flower, she thought of her old country, her homeland, and missed it. Yet, she felt that life was full of hope again. She knew she should adjust to the new situation, though she was still too shaky to say the words ""at home."" Ultimately, she burst into tears again, missing her homeland very much; ""snows"" symbolize the difficult situation she faces now. But she believed she could overcome it, and life was full of hope. ""Spring"" symbolizes the hope for a new life, as Saeng thought things would get better in the spring and that she would succeed then. She had the determination to succeed, so the author uses that paragraph at the conclusion, symbolizing hope and her resolve to build a new life."
1392	10259	4	3	The author included this because she felt that since Saeng failed the test that maybe she should be given a second chance because she tried so hard before. When Saeng says “Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it,” it made her mom upset because she used a lot of money for one plant just so she could feel at home again since she had one when she was at her old home. The mom's reaction stemmed from worrying about finances and wanting Saeng to adjust without spending so much. Eventually her mom says, “It’s a beautiful plant” to make her feel better because she feels bad for how she acted towards her daughter, understanding Saeng's longing for familiarity. After all the things Saeng had to go through with the move and the pressure to adjust, the author added the last passage into the story to show a moment of understanding and reconciliation between mother and daughter, highlighting the importance of empathy during times of change.
1393	10260	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, saying that Saeng will not quit until she passes that test. She will try and try, even to the point of death. The author is referring to the story again, emphasizing Saeng's unwavering determination and relentless pursuit of her goal, suggesting a level of commitment that transcends even her own well-being, highlighting the profound dedication she has towards achieving success in her endeavors.
1394	10261	4	3	The author's purpose of this conclusion is that every year when the snow melts and the geese return, she will again have to take care of the plant. That's clear because taking a test is a big responsibility; therefore, taking care of that plant is also a significant task, referring to the cyclical nature of responsibility, much like having to take the test again and again. This is what the purpose of the concluding sentence meant, highlighting the recurring commitment.
1395	10262	4	3	Because planting flowers and working on the garden is @CAPS1's hobby, a source of joy and relaxation. And without it, she can't think clearly or focus on creating new things, as gardening helps clear her mind. Therefore, waiting until they are back will not only make her happier, but also ensure she is able to fully dedicate herself to her work with renewed focus and inspiration.
1396	10263	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One is because she is saying when everything gets back to normal, that's when she is going to take the test again. Second, because there would be nothing else to say if it is not back to the way she wanted it to be, implying a sense of hope for a return to normalcy. For instance, if you were building a house and a blizzard came, you would stop; you said that you would not continue until there was nice weather again. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons, primarily to emphasize the protagonist's resilience and deferred hope for a brighter, more stable future.
1397	10264	4	3	The author of Winter Hibiscus, Minfong Ho, ended the story in this way to show the theme of starting over. Her mother adds to the theme of starting over by saying, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty but it’s strong enough to make it through the winter. That’s what matters.” Her words are a metaphor for the family starting their lives again in America, that America might not be as pretty, but it will survive, which is what matters. Her words soothe her daughter’s worries about starting over. Also, the budding hibiscus could be considered a symbol of rebirth, since it is dying and growing with the seasons. The family is dying out as a Thai family and being American was a Thai family. However, even though they “died” as a Thai family, that does not mean that they have lost their heritage, which is why the author ends talking about a flower that is both Thai and American, just like Saeng, highlighting the enduring strength and adaptability inherent in embracing a new beginning while retaining one's roots.
1398	10265	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will persevere through the winter and try to adapt to her new lifestyle. Moving to a new country/culture is extremely tough, and Saeng is sad, but she doesn’t give up on creating a new life in @LOCATION1. The concluding sentence, “in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test,” is one of determination and hope. The entire story Saeng was struggling with adapting to her new life, and memory of her homeland gives her a sense of security. The sentence wraps up her emotion and shows how strong she is. She could easily give up on her driving test, but she won’t. It is a happy ending for somewhat of a sad story. Furthering the sentence shows Saeng’s devotion to her plant. This hibiscus will survive and so will Saeng when the hibiscus blooms in the spring, so will Saeng. She will try as hard as she can to fit in and enjoy her new life. That plant will help her through it by reminding her of Vietnam as well as giving her a companion throughout the winter. The author would not have chosen a better conclusion for this story. The conclusion brings us to a new hope to persevere and succeed. As a result, the reader is left with a sense of pleasure and a good feeling toward the story. This conclusion shows how Saeng is adapting to changes and has hope to enjoy her new life in @LOCATION1.
1399	10266	4	3	"The story was about a girl walking home after failing her driving test and breaking down about the ""home"" where she no longer lived. After she had broken down, bought the plant as a symbol of new growth, and learned to actually accept the fact that she no longer lived in Vietnam, embracing her new life, and accepting that she had failed her driving test, a temporary setback, she realized that she just has to learn to like it here, her new home. She also learned that her time will come and she will one day be driving. The reason why the author concluded the story with this paragraph is because this is the conclusion of the story; this is where one realizes the important things, accepting the present and looking forward to the future with newfound optimism."
1400	10267	4	3	In the story ìWinter Hibiscusî the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with a statement that Saeng vowed silently to herself. Saeng says she will take the test again referring to the drivers test. Seeing the geese flying in a ìVî formation and seeing the winter hibiscus gave Saeng a sense of remembrance to her homeland, reminding her of the familiar sights of Vietnam and easing her loneliness. Saeng misses her homeland. The author wanted it to seem to the READER as if Saeng is starting to feel at home again, finding comfort in these small connections to her past while embracing her present. The hibiscus is just a symbol to Saeng telling her that it will be O.K., and that itís okay for her to miss Vietnam but also that itís okay to have a new life, finding a balance between honoring her roots and building a future in a new place. So Saeng, in the spring, will go take her drivers test again with a new attitude, carrying with her the hope and resilience symbolized by the winter hibiscus, and will pass the test.
1401	10268	4	3	The author used that paragraph in order to create imagery, painting a vivid picture in the reader's mind. The author wants you to get an image of the story, to see the setting and characters as clearly as possible. She also used that paragraph to express her emotions, conveying the feelings of the characters and the overall mood of the scene.
1402	10269	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph to tell you when Saeng was going to take the test again and to reunite with the plant. This conclusion gives insight into the future, revealing Saeng's renewed determination and hope for success, which is precisely why the author chose to include it, leaving the reader with a sense of optimistic anticipation.
1403	10270	4	3	The author ends the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to show a comparison. Since the plant reminds her of home, when it buds she will be more confident to take the test. When she was looking at the petals of the flower it said, “Gently she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least she could hold on to.” This shows that she really missed her home, and she had nothing to give her confidence. The flower is the piece of confidence she needs to feel at home and even pass her drivers test. Saeng felt out of place in her new environment. The hibiscus flower, with its vibrant color, gave her motivation. It gave her a chance to connect with a part from her old home, in her new home. Saeng thinks, “And that rich sweet scent- that was familiar too”. This shows that this flower was of sentimental importance, something she needed to ground her. Therefore, the author ended with that paragraph to show a comparison and highlight the importance of the flower to her adapting and finding the strength to try again.
1404	10271	4	3	In ìWinter Hibiscus,î Minfong Ho ends the story as she does to show a sign of hope. Saeng is going to start over when the world starts over. Spring, with its blossoming trees and melting snow, is a time of renewal, when animals emerge. Saeng ìVowed silently to herself to try again in the spring time.î Saeng purchases the hibiscus in remembrance of her homeland, but also to know when it is ready to come back out of the base to try again. The hibiscus demonstrates this by coming out of its buds and blooming, signifying resilience. Ho ends her story in hope of a new beginning. Saeng vows, ìThen I will take that test again,î showing her determination. The word choice of ìThat test againî depicts her new attitude. She wants to try again, approaching her test with newfound resolve and optimism, illustrating a belief in her ability to overcome challenges.
1405	10272	4	3	to show how absent she feels without them by her. You see this when the @ORGANIZATION1 says “when they come back.” also when she says “the geese return & this hibiscus is budding.” Shows how she feel without them and how she will feel when they return and how she will carry on where they left off last time as shown when she says “, Then I will take that test again.” These instances highlight the void in her life during their absence, the anticipation of their return, and her resolve to resume her endeavors. This emphasizes the cyclical nature of their relationship and her life, where their presence and absence mark distinct phases.
1406	10273	4	3	"""I think it was good enough"" by Minfong Ho evokes a sense of bittersweet tranquility. Throughout the story, the reader experiences happiness mingled with sadness, yet maintains an overall feeling of calmness. This happiness arises when the characters discuss the plants and especially when the mother accepts the purchased plants. Initially, there's apprehension that the mother might scold her for the purchase, particularly after failing her test. While you empathize with the girl's situation, a calm mood persists, reflecting the girl's quiet determination and willingness to persevere, ultimately creating a peaceful and heartwarming story about acceptance and understanding."
1407	10274	4	3	I feel that the author concludes the story with the paragraph saying that she’s going to take the test again, to show us that this time she’s going to pass the test and she’s not going to feel the same way she felt when she didn’t pass. It tells us it’s in “spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” because that’s when she is going to take the test, signifying a time of renewal and a fresh start, reinforcing the idea that her second attempt will be different.
1408	10275	4	3	Saeng vowed silently to herself and to her mother too. Saeng decided to tell her mother what she had done, “she failed the test,” probably her mom get upset with her but then she talk to her again. Saeng’s mother asked her about the plant that she had with her. Saeng said that she bought the plant by @MONEY1. She was sad because she failed the test, and when she bought the plant, it probably made her feel better. I think the author probably concludes the story with this paragraph because it brings some kind of hope to her, and she probably will pass the test. When she said, “then I will take that test again,” @CAPS1 makes her decide to take it again; it could be the plant giving her that renewed sense of determination, suggesting a brighter future despite the initial setback.
1409	10276	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wants to show the readers that Saeng will want to pass her driver's license test. The reason is to show the reader how determined Saeng is after the winter. The example is that in the story, Saeng failed her driver's license and was sad about it. The next example is that when she finds the flower, she knows she'll try again. This shows that the flower helps her feel better, indicating that she will do it again. The first example shows that she was sad that she failed the test. At the conclusion, the author includes this statement in the story to show readers that Saeng will pass the driver's license test later on, highlighting her resilience and future success.
1410	10277	4	3	"In the story Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with Saeng saying “when they come back in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author chose to end the story this way to give it a positive ending. The rest of the story is sad because Saeng misses her home in Vietnam and feels displaced in her new environment. ""Its – it’s not a real one. I mean, it’s not like the kind we had at – at – she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. Not like the ones we had before."" The end sends the message that even though things are different than before, she won’t give up trying to make a good life in the United States and not let this change affect her. Saeng's resilience is highlighted as she looks forward to spring, symbolizing a new beginning and a renewed chance to succeed, showing her determination to adapt and thrive despite her feelings of loss."
1411	10278	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to know that she will regain her confidence when the ""hibiscus is budding"" and take another slot at the driving test. He doesn't want to just leave us hanging with the girl watching the geese fly away into the distance after her disappointing experience. The girl felt very bad about failing the test, which makes the reader feel sad for her situation. To cheer up the reader and offer a sense of hope, he ended the story in this way. Saeng is reminded of home and the cyclical nature of life when ""the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" So, the author ends the story having Saeng have a sense of renewed confidence and the reader feeling happy, suggesting that setbacks are temporary and new beginnings are always possible."
1412	10279	4	3	The author concludes the story with that because she is determined to succeed in @LOCATION1. She misses her homeland and everything there: gardens, grandparents etc. For example , she walked into the flowershop; she smells the flowers like she used to back home. She then smelled a flower that reminded her of her grandmothers ìlong gray hair, freshly washed Öî. This sensory experience further emphasizes her longing for home and her connection to her roots. But by saying that last sentence, she demonstrates resilience: when the hibiscus budded next winter, she will take the test that she failed again, showing her resolve to build a future in @LOCATION1 despite her homesickness.
1413	10280	4	3	"The author concludes the story with ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again,"" because the girl is willing to try again and to not give up no matter what, showcasing her resilient spirit. The girl is upset because she doesn't have the real flower her mom had. ""It's-it's not a real one,"" Saeng mumbled ""I mean, not like the kind we had at- at."" She was upset and afraid that her mother was going to be angry with her that she started to shake. ""I know,"" her mother said quietly. ""I've seen this kind blooming along the lake."" The author is simply conveying that despite her current disappointment and the substitution of the flower, the girl is going to try again next time, demonstrating her determination to succeed."
1414	10281	4	3	The author concludes the story ìWinter Hibiscusî with that paragraph because he wants to get across to the reader that Saeng will not give up. Saeng and her family moved from Vietnam, and it has been hard for her to adjust to changes. Saeng really misses her homeland and the flowers that she sees as a symbol of life. She explains how the winter hibiscus is not the same as the one in Vietnam, so she plants this different type of flower and decides to wait till the spring to take the driving test. This shows that Saeng wants to plant her difficulties in America and think of them again in the spring when the weather and atmosphere is nice. She is not giving up, but she does not want to take on the difficulties until a later time. That is why the author concluded with this paragraph, highlighting her resilience and hopeful outlook despite the challenges she faces.
1415	10282	4	3	I thank he uses it because she wants to get another one next year to see what it's like to like something so much and get to look after it for a while. That is why I think the narrator uses that phrase as his last one, implying a cycle of affection and temporary ownership, a bittersweet understanding of her desires.
1416	10283	4	3	The author concludes this story with the paragraph she did because it shows how Saeng is adapting with the change she is going through in America. The winter hibiscus helped her cope with failing her driving test, so Saeng figures it will give her luck when she takes it again. Also the hibiscus will survive, and while she works towards her goal it will develop more. Once the flower blooms, it will symbolize strength, helping Saeng overcome this obstacle. Her mother said the flower was not as pretty but will survive. She means America might not be as great as Vietnam, but Saeng will stay strong.
1417	10284	4	3	The purpose for the ending the author is to show how the hibiscus gives Saeng a good sense of comfort, compared to how she was at the beginning of the story. It was like she had very little confidence, feeling lost and displaced. And now she is forced to call this strange place home, and that emptied her desire to strive until she sees a very familiar face that brings back her memories of when she was the happiest. Having something around that was special to her around all the time can make Saeng feel at home or like it use to be; she found her comfort in the hibiscus. So now that it rests in her garden to constantly grow through all the seasons, she will too, with that reminder of her old home and how good it felt, except now with new memories, suggesting a hopeful outlook and a growing sense of belonging in her new environment.
1418	10285	4	3	@PERSON1 go to the top and then over the hill, proceeding with caution as you navigate the terrain.
1419	10286	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of different reasons. The author wants to show with meaning that the budding of the hibiscus plant will be symbolic. Ho states, ""Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits."" This shows meaning because it is currently a point in time where Saeng has to overcome negative circumstances, and with the struggling plant it shows symbolically the challenges she faces. At another point in the story, Saeng realizes that there is much more meaning to the seasons, Ho states, ""Through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,"" she is realizing that come spring time, like the plant, she will have the opportunity to succeed and become somehow like a new person, suggesting hope for renewal and a brighter future."
1420	10287	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he or she feels like the audience should know what Saeng is feeling as the season turns again. This paragraph ending shows that Saeng will keep trying every spring to grow back her flowers, despite the challenges, and this shows that Saeng has a lot of potential to make her vow to herself successful.
1421	10288	4	3	This story is all about overcoming hardships and disappointments as well as accepting and adapting to the things life throws at people, so it is appropriate that the story is ended with a goal and a determined attitude. Throughout the entire reading, Saeng sought comfort in the things most familiar to her, such as flowers and the taste of bitter melon. She was hurting and disappointed after failing her driver's test, and those familiar comforts were the only things that gave her peace. It was those things that gave her the courage she needed to retake her driver’s test in the spring, so it seems fitting that she end the story with the mention of the hibiscus. The end paragraph also shows that Saeng is adapting well to her new country and finding beauty in it. She says, “when they come back... in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return...” At first the sounds of geese were alien to her, but now she has accepted their honking as a normal sound, even something to look forward to. This implies that she is learning to accept her new country and integrate into her surroundings, which is the perfect way to end the story and highlight her resilience.
1422	10289	4	3	The author concludes the story this way because in the winter time she won't be able to see the hibiscus. She is used to going outside in the garden and seeing her beautiful plant. In conclusion, the author concludes the story that way, because in the winter time she won't see her plant, and she anticipates missing its vibrant presence in her garden.
1423	10290	4	3	In the story Saeng is trying to be ok with her new home. I think the author put that in the story to show that she has not given up on making the best of things. She is going to keep trying to adjust to her new home and find her place in it. Saeng wants to adjust, to feel a sense of belonging, but she misses her old home too much, the familiar sights and sounds constantly on her mind. That is why she is waiting till spring to try again, hoping the change of seasons will bring a fresh perspective and make the transition easier. Ultimately, this shows Saeng's resilience and determination to adapt, even amidst her longing for the past.
1424	10291	4	3	The author concludes the story with that like, to leave the reader guessing. The author means that she is determined to live up to her past, and get through it. The paragraph leaves the reader to wonder if she got through it the following year. He describes the snow melting, and geese coming back as change, which is exactly what she hopes to achieve, suggesting a potential for renewal in her life. The author was trying to show how she can change, and grow just like her plant, implying a sense of hope and the possibility of a brighter future.
1425	10292	4	3	The author concludes with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She writes that because when her flower starts budding, she will be able to take the test, reflecting a connection to nature. The author uses this conclusion because when the flower is going to bud and the geese come back, it symbolizes a return and renewal, leading her to feel like she is back home, ready to face the challenge of the test again. That's why I think the author used the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to emphasize Saeng's renewed determination tied to the cycles of nature.
1426	10293	4	3	In winter hibiscus the teenager girl Saeng fails her driverís test, and then runs into a winter hibiscus and comes in touch with her memories. The author concludes the story with re-trying the test when the geese return and hibiscus buds to show comfort & familiarity. When the speaker says ìalmost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had becomeî this example shows that she had lost touch with the realness of nature and that was what was going to get her to pass the test. The author sets an impatient mood for the reader because it took her the entire winter to discover this connection. It was only in winter that she noticed her surroundings, a time when it seems too late, as the geese have left and the flower has closed. Therefore, when spring comes, theyíll be open to new opportunities and so will she with the familiarity around her, suggesting a hopeful return to the test with a newfound sense of belonging and awareness.
1427	10294	4	3	I think she concluded with this statement because she doesn't know if she will pass, but she isn't giving up on the test and will try to pass it again when her flower grows back. Right now she feels bad, and the plant helped to cheer her up, so when she sees the plant next year, she wants to take the test again with renewed hope. The plant is like a sign of good luck and a reminder of resilience. I think she concluded with this paragraph because it leaves you with the idea not to give up when times are hard; keep trying, as even after setbacks, there is always potential for regrowth and future success.
1428	10295	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a few reasons. One of the reason is so the reader could imagine what rest of the story would be like if it continued, allowing for personal interpretation. For example, when the author said ""then I will take that test again,"" it suggests perseverance and future possibilities. Another reason is to give the reader one last good image to change their thought of the story, leaving them with a sense of hope or resolution. For example, when the author said ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" it evokes a sense of renewal and optimism. Those were reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, ultimately shaping the reader's lasting impression."
1429	10296	4	3	The author concludes the story like this because when the snow is melting and the plant is budding and the geese come back then she will take the test again. This is a way for her to really think about *when* she is going to do this again, almost like a promise to herself. When they come back, so will she, to take the test over again, signifying a cycle of renewal and determination tied to the natural world.
1430	10297	4	3	"Saeng vowed silently to herself, ""When the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again."" It was a promise born of resilience, a commitment to try again when nature signaled a fresh start. For some reason I think that is a fine idea Saeng vowed, marking a period of renewed hope and determination, fueled by the changing seasons."
1431	10298	4	3	The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî probably chose to end the story that way because then itís ending with a sense of hope. Also, it is showing how Saeng is adapting to her surroundings much like the winter hibiscus. In the second last paragraph, Saeng hears the hanks of the geese and it is noted that their sound has become familiar to her. Through the course of the time Saeng probably vowed to retake the test when the geese returned because the time would allow her to grow and adapt even more to her new life. The hibiscus will be budding then, a sign that it overcame its obstacles and was successful in adopting to the new environment. If the hibiscus could adapt, Saeng could too. She could look to the plant for inspiration and encouragement in her own journey. This feeling of hope in Saeng and her future is left in the last paragraph, which is why the story ends there, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism for her prospects.
1432	10299	4	3	The author concludes this paragraph to the story because, seasons change, plants don't most likely grow during winter time. So you learn a lesson and take it as it is and wait until the next time you learn basically the same lesson, when the right time comes, understanding that growth, like nature, has its cycles and periods of dormancy that we must patiently respect.
1433	10300	4	3	"I think that the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" was a good story, and also the author added the paragraph at the end because the main idea was like to work hard. That is why it mentions at the very end, ""I will take the test again,"" so you don't fall and stay down; you work hard and get back up and try again. This reinforces the story's theme of perseverance and resilience, highlighting the importance of not giving up in the face of setbacks."
1434	10301	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph so he can convey the overall meaning. Also, the author concludes with this paragraph because it likely holds a moral, offering insights or perhaps clarifying certain events within the narrative that might not have been fully understood until this concluding moment, thereby solidifying the story's ultimate message.
1435	10302	4	3	The story is somewhat sad. The girl misses her homeland. She is also sad because she failed her driving test. Failing a test especially a driving test stinks. You're very excited to get it but then you don’t. So the author is trying to show that despite the girl's sadness she will not give up. The girl is going to keep trying until she finally passes. The author, I think, ends the story with the girl saying she will take the test again, to show that even though she is sad about her country and failing, she is not going to give up. Also, the author probably wanted to leave on a more positive note; you usually don’t want to leave a story sad with no solution, so she said she would try the test again. There were many reasons why the author ended the way she did, but above are the more obvious, revealing that even in moments of combined disappointment and longing, resilience and hope can still prevail.
1436	10303	4	3	"In the story ìWinter Hibiscus,î the story ends with that phrase to show that Saeng has goals. First, she wants to adapt to this new land, as shown when she talks about fitting in and understanding American customs. This is because she says that when they come back in the spring, which means she won't give up and try to adapt to her new life. This also says she has precision; she will continue to try to get her license because she says, ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She says that she will try again, revealing her determination. Also, it exploits that she will get the courage to keep on trying and not give up, demonstrating her resilience in the face of challenges. Thus, the ending emphasizes Saeng's forward-looking perspective and her commitment to building a future in her new home."
1437	10304	4	3	Saeng was waiting for spring then she could take the test again. I think Saeng was worrying about it being spring because she went to watch the geese fly in a U shape and she went to see the plants grow, but the snow didn’t melt yet. She started talking to herself about it, but she really wanted to take the test during spring, if she could pass it again because she doesn’t like to take the test over and over again. She was looking forward to when everybody gets to do different things after the test is over, showing how much she longed to move on.
1438	10305	4	3	In the story ìWinter Hibiscusî by Minfong Ho, the main character Saeng who moved to America from Vietnam with her family, just came home from failing her driverís test. To Saeng her failing the driverís test shows that she is struggling to adapt to her family's new lifestyle. Therefore she feels that she disappointed her mother and herself. On her way home she bought a winter hibiscus, a flower that her family also had back in Vietnam to try and comfort her mother. As her mother begins to plant the flower, a winter Hibiscus, she feels that her mother has forgiven her for failing the drivers test. Then she realized that she has the capacity to adapt to her surroundings just like she believes her flower will, and that motivates her to promise to take the drivers test again in the spring. By ending the story with Saengís promise Minfong, the author, made sure that the last thing which is the most important thing for the reader to remember about the story is that Saeng didnít give up. She promised herself that she will try again and adapt to her surroundings, understanding that it will be on her own terms. Her promise shows courage and perserverance, highlighting her resilience and determination to succeed.
1439	10306	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is not giving up; she will take the test again, demonstrating her resilience. And the seedling will grow again in the spring, symbolizing renewed hope and the cyclical nature of perseverance.
1440	10307	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying she is learning to adapt to this country. Earlier in the story she says that she failed the test, because she did not impress her mom. Saeng and her mom are used to life in Vietnam, and they are trying to adapt here. Saeng thought that the hibiscus she got is just like the one she had at home. At the end she realizes if she just has faith everything will be alright, and it will be just like home. She says in the spring because by then her hibiscus will be fully grown and she will take the test again to see if the hibiscus is like the one her mother thought she would get. Saeng is learning to adapt to her new country of the United States.
1441	10308	4	3	"The author concludes with that paragraph because it expresses and continues the theme of perseverance and adapting to change. The conclusion mentions the ""test"" again, solidifying its importance. From the reading, one can conclude that this test that the author refers to is Saeng’s confrontation of memories of home without feeling the breakdown from loss. Saeng says earlier in the story that she ""failed the test,"" having broken down in tears after looking at all the familiar plants that had been at home, triggering intense feelings of displacement. By concluding with this paragraph, which says she will take the test again, it shows that Saeng is going to continue to try to adapt to her new home and feel at peace here, instead of feeling the tremendous loss of her old home and succumbing to despair. It shows the theme of perseverance because she is going to take the test again and try to overcome the feeling of sorrow, indicating a hopeful outlook and a commitment to building a new life."
1442	10309	4	3	The girl is determined to win. She went and took a test for a flower and she did not pass, and she went back sad and emotional. She told her grandmother that these flowers are not like the ones at—at she could not say at home because it took too much pain, and her grandmother said they are not like the real ones, the ones that truly mattered, reinforcing the girl's feelings of longing.
1443	10310	4	3	In this story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with, “When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In the beginning of the story, Saeng was less confident and she failed the test. The unfamiliar environment and the pressure of adapting to a new culture contributed to her anxiety. But this one flower, blooming defiantly in the cold, gave her hope, reminding her of the resilience she possessed. And so next time she takes the test, she’ll be better prepared, not just academically, but also emotionally, armed with a renewed sense of self-assurance.
1444	10311	4	3	"The author would conclude the essay like he did because it sounded good and helped tie all the sprawling ideas together. For example, one person said, ìshe silently vowed to herself in the spring after the snow melts she would retake that test,"" a sentiment that nicely encapsulates the theme of resilience, allowing the piece to end on a hopeful note."
1445	10312	4	3	I think the author ended the story with that sentence because every winter all or most plants die off, and during the spring they would have to start all over in growing this plant, facing the same initial challenges of cultivation and nurturing its delicate growth. This cyclical nature emphasizes the perseverance required and the constant effort needed to maintain what they had achieved.
1446	10313	4	3	The author ends the story this way because they're trying to show that Saeng will be dedicated to the hibiscus gardening, indicating a commitment to hard work. Once she proves herself, demonstrating perseverance and skill, she will have passed the test. It also shows that she wants her heritage to be a major part of her life by growing their nation's flower, thus solidifying her connection to her roots and embracing her identity.
1447	10314	4	3	"The author ends the story with this quote because it shows how determined Saeng is to passing her driving test. For example, in the story, ""Winter Hibiscus"", Saeng after she fails her driving test says something to forget about failing, and she said, ""Let’s plant, right now,"" she said this because she was trying to forget about her failing, and focus on something positive. This displays her resilience and her immediate shift towards a productive activity despite the setback. In conclusion, this is why the author ends with this quote, and an example of how determined and focused Saeng is to passing her driving test."
1448	10315	4	3	The author concluded the story the way they did because it left hope. Saeng had been hurt and disappointed, but in the end she had shown hope in the story. Saeng failed her driving test and was very disappointed. In the end, it showed she was not going to quit in this new country, despite this setback. She was going to move on and make the best of what she has, demonstrating resilience and a positive outlook for her future.
1449	10316	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph because she is determined to complete and pass the test. One reason is that she failed this year and wants to pass next year, showing her resolve to overcome the setback. Next, she is comparing the hibiscus to her passing and succeeding on the test, suggesting that just as the hibiscus blooms, she too will flourish with dedication and effort. This comparison underscores her hopeful outlook and reinforces why she ends the story with this image of perseverance.
1450	10317	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is going to try to keep her next plant, understanding its value beyond a mere test. The reason why she says she is going to take the test again is not simply because she sold the plant to somebody, but because she wants to nurture one successfully. Saeng has seeded the plant before as a child, explaining why she was so attached to it. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will try and keep her next plant, demonstrating growth and a deeper appreciation.
1451	10318	4	3	The author concludes the last paragraph to show that after a time period you can come back and try something again. Or maybe when weather changes this can be different for Saeng. Maybe she is relating herself to the plant, suggesting that when spring arrives, the flower will be stronger, and she feels that she will pass the test the second time around when the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding. And it also shows how she appreciates nature, because if she didn't, why would she wait until spring and when the snow is melting to try again? The conclusion of the story is that she does like nature, because she talks about the hibiscus and its potential for renewed growth, mirroring her own hope for a second chance.
1452	10319	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, a girl named Saeng is trying to adjust to America coming from Vietnam. She is sad and misses her home, especially after failing her driver's test. She walks by a store and recognizes a plant from her home. She buys it and takes it home in a pot, thinking of home and all the great memories she shared with the plant. Her mother then comes and shares the moment with her. Saeng feels better now. In the end sentence the author includes “Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” (Ho, ??) The flower has given her the confidence to succeed, and she wants to take the test again. This shows the connection she has with her home and the flowers, providing a tangible link to her past. She wants to overcome her sadness and plan onward, not leaving her memories behind but her pain, using the hibiscus as a symbol of hope and resilience in her new environment.
1453	10320	4	3	In the story ìWinter Hibiscus,î the author chose to conclude the story the way she did to show the comfort the hibiscus provided that allowed Saeng to move on. The greenhouse, with its familiar warmth and life, provided a place for her to get her feelings out about her home sickness, ìand in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.î Then when she went home she was faced with the reality again of how she failed the test, a symbol of her academic struggles. I think when she failed the test it brought out feelings of how she thinks she is failing to adjust her new home. But when the geese fly by, heading north for the summer, the author brought the story to a conclusion to show how the experience has made Saeng grow. ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again.î I think the author wanted to show that through the events in the story, particularly her connection with the hibiscus and the natural cycle of the seasons, she was able to overcome her feelings about a new home.
1454	10321	4	3	"I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it’s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks about how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snow is gone, and it's spring, that's when she’ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus ""comes back to life,"" it's having like a second chance, and she deserves one also. When it's bright out again and things start looking good, she’ll feel good about taking the test over again. How she ended it to me was good because it shows a sense of hope. You just have to read into it and try to understand what she is actually saying, looking for the underlying meaning. So practically, she’s stating once everything ""come back to life,"" then she’ll feel like she will pass it next time, as she associates the season with renewal and success. Now she can be prepared, having learned from her experience."
1455	10322	4	3	"There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. One reason is she likes hibiscus flowers; you can tell by when she says, ""When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently."" Another reason is that they are pretty, evident when she says, ""It was like walking into another world."" The last reason is that she appreciates their presence, as illustrated when she says, ""Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps do tenantís, ferns, and fronds and virus of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion."" As you can see, these are reasons why the author ended with that paragraph, highlighting the beauty and personal connection found in the natural world."
1456	10323	4	3	"The author of this story was smart to end it by saying she will take the test again in the spring, when everything blooms. This girl just failed her driving test and she does not want to take it right away. The blooming of the hibiscus symbolizes her old life at her old home and is also symbolizing a new start when it blooms again. This will give her the confidence to pass her driving test and make her excited to get a new start on the year. ""Spring is when the snows melt and geese return."" This quote from this paragraph states that the snow will melt away and the geese will come back home, just like she wants to go home and feel comfortable; at home, you are comfortable. The author ended this story of this girl, Saeng, with hope and drive to do what she wants to do, suggesting a positive outlook for her future endeavors. That is why it was smart to end the story like they ended it, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism."
1457	10324	4	3	The hibiscus, as the author reveals to the audience, is a beautiful flower that in the story represents the memories of a young girl who has failed a test, knowing she was too depressed by her failure. The flower serves as a symbol of encouragement to the sad girl during her most tragic event and shows how a little flower offers comfort. The girl, Saeng, vowed to demonstrate that when she overcomes the sad memories, she'll be capable of proving she will pass, after she feels ok about the situation she is experiencing with her destroyed life after having to come to a different country where you must have a @PERCENT1 of capacity, and it's logical that the adaptation of the girl is not going to be right away. In other words, the author's message is to motivate people who have problems in their lives and to show that life is not about giving up; instead, you should keep working hard until you get there. In conclusion, working hard and @CAPS1 giving up are a part of our life, and it's up to ourselves to overcome failing, demonstrating that perseverance is key to achieving our goals.
1458	10325	4	3	"In the story, @CAPS1 concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I think he ends it this way because she has accepted that she failed or lost but is willing to try again to accomplish her goal and ""take that test again"". The imagery of the melting snow and returning geese signals a time of renewal and hope, mirroring Saeng's own renewed determination. Also she is making a promise, or a vow to herself to not give up on her goal. The budding hibiscus, specifically mentioned, represents the potential for growth and success that lies ahead. This ending emphasizes Saeng's resilience and commitment to pursuing her dreams, even in the face of setbacks, ultimately illustrating her enduring spirit."
1459	10326	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because they both go together. They are both about things going and leaving, the season changing. Like they don't want to let go, but they know they'll be back soon. That's why the author combined the story with the paragraph, creating a sense of cyclical return and bittersweet acceptance of change.
1460	10327	4	3	"The author is expressing hope for the future in her concluding paragraph although just failing her drivers test and adjusting to a new atmosphere. Saeng finds comfort in a Hibiscus. ""It felt smooth and cool with a hint of velvet toward the center - just as she had known it would feel."" This expresses that the remembrance of ""an old friend"" was able to lift her spirits after a previous disappointment. It was obvious Saeng was uncomfortable in her environment, which her mother noticed when she arrived at home. ""She paused as she noticed the tear stains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes."" Her daughter was not adjusting to her new atmosphere, and even though she had spent a lot of money on a single flower, she understood. With all the negative attitude throughout the story, once Saeng saw the geese and planted her ""winter"" hibiscus, she realized what was strange to her before had now become familiar, indicating a shift in her perspective. Saeng finally realizes with a memory of home, her goals can be accomplished and life can be stable somewhere other than home, suggesting a newfound resilience. She illustrates that from failure comes success, a testament to her evolving adaptability and optimism."
1461	10328	4	3	The author concluded the story in the paragraph. She doesn’t want Saeng vows the whole room to herself where it’s quiet when she is taking the test, believing it's more important for Saeng to learn to focus amidst distractions, a skill that will serve her well beyond this particular exam.
1462	10329	4	3	She is saying that right now is not the right time to table the test; she is going to wait to come back until spring, when the flowers are blooming, to take the test. She is so eccentric about the exotic flowers. She can't stand to do it now, when the time isn't right, because the flower blooms are an important factor for her. So, she is saying that she is going to wait until the time is right, with the flowers in bloom, to take the test, as that is the optimal environment for her.
1463	10330	4	3	Saeng will take the test in the spring when itís not so cold. She likes it when the hibiscus is budding; they smell so good. The good smell reminds her of her native country. Saeng likes fried melon; it leaves a golden aftertaste on your tongue. She would prefer it over a Big Mac. It is the familiar flavors that connect her to home.
1464	10331	4	3	These are many reasons why the author ends the story with this paragraph. This final passage likely serves to solidify the story's central theme, offering a concise restatement of the core message the author intended to convey. It might also provide a sense of closure, resolving any lingering questions or plot threads left unanswered, giving the reader a feeling of completion. Furthermore, the concluding paragraph could offer a final, resonant image or idea, leaving a lasting impression on the reader long after they've finished the story and cementing the narrative's overall impact. The author strategically uses this space to ensure the story's message resonates and lingers effectively.
1465	10332	4	3	The author included that concluding paragraph because the hibiscus shows Saeng comfort in her time of discomfort. She would possibly feel more comfortable when the hibiscus is budding because she misses her homeland, and the hibiscus reminds her of that homesickness, a feeling compounded by her initial failure on a test, perhaps stemming from the challenges of adjusting to a new environment. But when spring comes, she’ll be more confident and comfortable because the hibiscus is budding, signifying a sense of resilience and adaptation that mirrors her own journey.
1466	10333	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because earlier in the story, Saeng was talking about how she failed the test, a disappointment she clearly felt deeply and for which she wanted to retake. So, Saeng declared that next year, when the geese return, signaling the change of seasons, and the hibiscus is budding, a symbol of beauty and perseverance, she shall take the test again, armed with renewed determination and a year's worth of further study. This ending emphasizes her resolve.
1467	10334	4	3	"The reason why the author concludes this paragraph is to show Saeng that she will be waiting for them to grow back and she will try again for her test. Hibiscus means a lot to her, and she will keep trying because she doesn't want her mother disappointed in her again. An example of when Saeng felt shame is when ""her mother stared at her incredulously. But how could you?"" Saeng wants to not let down herself or her mother. ""Saeng vowed silently to herself,"" promising that she will pass and respect nature as well as elders, resolving to learn from her mistake and honor her family."
1468	10335	4	3	In ìWinter Hibiscus,î by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph: ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.î The author concludes the story in this way because it is somewhat of a cliffhanger. In the story, Saeng is upset about failing her driving test, and she has just moved from Vietnam to the United States, so she is a little homesick. She sees a familiar plant, and so she purchases it for nineteen dollars because it cheers her up, reminding her of plants in Vietnam. By ending the story like this, you know that Saeng hasnít given up and that she is going to try and pass the drivers license test again. But what you donít know is the end result of whether she passes or not, and so it is a cliffhanger, leaving the reader to imagine Saeng's future success. That is why the author ended the story in this way.
1469	10336	4	3	Saeng has been the victim of a tragic loss in family and also a move to a totally different world. The paragraph is symbolic of turning over a new leaf and starting over. The “snows melting” and “hibiscus budding” are both symbolizing new life and the promise of warmer days ahead. Saeng is going to have a new outlook on life and accept her situation to make the best of it. Also, the author says “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now” as it does compare to Saeng's new found outlook planted on life. Like the flower, a seed of hope was planted into Saeng, and now she is ready to blossom, embracing the potential for growth and beauty in this unfamiliar environment, suggesting a resilient spirit ready to bloom despite the hardships.
1470	10337	4	3	In the story, ìwinter hibiscusî, by @ORGANIZATION1, the author is very sentimental over the Hibiscus plant because it reminds her so much of her home. The reason why the author concludes the story with that saying was because it gave her a goal. She failed once at getting a job, but she @MONTH1 believed that the Hibiscus is good luck, so she set a goal on when to try for the job again. When she saw the plant, she remembered happy memories, and it brought her comfort. In conclusion, certain things can trigger your memories, but it's the good memories that make things in life something to wait and hope for, ultimately giving us strength.
1471	10338	4	3	The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons. ìShe realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had becomeÖ almost familiar nowî that is when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not so bad, especially given the changes she is experiencing. This is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test again. Also it shows how the hibiscus she just planted is already important to her, symbolizing her growing roots. The second thing it does is invite dreams about future conclusions. The reader does not know if she will pass the test next time but assumes that she will because of the way she vows it, demonstrating her determination. That is why the author ends this story the way they did: to show how she feels in her new life and leave an opening for people to draw conclusions about her potential success and continued adaptation.
1472	10339	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story she fails the driving test, so they added she was going to take it over. And maybe the plant is or would be good luck to her after the snow melts and the geese return; it would be a fresh start. Also, it would be nice after she discovered the plant, suggesting the possibility of renewed hope and a positive outlook despite the setback. This cyclical imagery of nature and new beginnings hints at resilience and the potential for success on her next attempt.
1473	10340	4	3	The author concludes the paragraph with this paragraph because she wants to try again. The author is saying that the hibiscus she planted @DATE1 did not work, and she is trying again this @DATE1 to grow a hibiscus plant, indicating her persistence. She will pass the test if she succeeds in the spring, suggesting that her gardening efforts are tied to some form of evaluation or personal goal. That is why the author concludes with this paragraph, emphasizing her renewed determination and the high stakes riding on her success.
1474	10341	4	3	He concludes that when it is spring he will take the test again, hoping for a better outcome. That will give her another chance to pass it, alleviating her concerns. This will give her another chance to do what is right and fulfill her responsibilities.
1475	10342	4	3	She going to take the test agan, and she feels like she needs to. She will decide when the snow melts and geese come back; that means she wants to take it in the Spring. It seems like waiting until Spring will give her ample time to prepare, so she can approach the test with confidence.
1476	10343	4	3	"In ìWinter Hibiscusî the author @CAPS1 sentence is ìWhen they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". I think the remembrance of home will help her take the test. She use to the geese and plant to remind her of home and by having these surroundings makes her comfortable, providing a sense of familiarity and peace amidst the stress of a new environment and challenging exam. This connection to her roots empowers her."
1477	10344	4	3	In the same way the hibiscus flower prevails in the winter, Saeng wants to be the same way. Saeng failed a test, which makes her feel unsuccessful. Saeng wants to prevail; she wants to stick it out, and the rough times she’s going through make it very difficult for her. When Saeng says, “I—I failed the test,” this shows that Saeng feels disappointed; she didn’t expect that because she is a fighter. So, the author ends the passage with Saeng saying, “When they come back, in the spring, when snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to show how much of a fighter Saeng is because she’s determined to strive under difficult conditions, demonstrating her resilience and unwavering commitment to overcoming obstacles.
1478	10345	4	3	The author puts this paragraph last because it shows that Saeng is looking to a new lease almost on life. She now has something to take her through the year that is ahead of her; she can now wait till it is winter once again to see the hibiscus flower bloom once again, as well as many more to come, providing her with a renewed sense of hope and anticipation for the future.
1479	10346	4	3	In the story ìWinter Hibiscusî by Minfong Ho, she concludes the story in this way to show that even though Saeng failed the test, she will try again someday, someday being symbolized by when the geese come back. Saeng is sad because she misses her homeland and the familiarity it offered, a feeling amplified by the unfamiliar surroundings. She sees plants that bring back memories, specifically of the vibrant life she left behind, so she buys a winter hibiscus to ease and comfort her, serving as a tangible reminder of home and a symbol of hope for a future return. Ultimately, the image of the returning geese mirrors Saeng's own anticipated return to her studies and, perhaps someday, to her homeland, demonstrating her resilience.
1480	10347	4	3	"The author concludes this story with that paragraph because she loves her garden. She concludes it because the story is about them and their garden, and it eventually turns cold, leaving them with nothing to do until spring. It suggests they have strong feelings for what they do, as it says, ""in spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus [is] budding""; here, she wants to take the test to overcome and prove she can take care of her garden, showing her dedication to its rebirth."
1481	10348	4	3	At this time she vowed to retake a test because of how the flowers will always come and go, a fleeting beauty, but her grades will be there only one time for her school work, a permanent record. Yet, instead of focusing on the test, she would rather garden then do school work, drawn to the immediate satisfaction of nurturing life. This realization, however, pushed her to prioritize her studies, understanding that academic success was a more lasting achievement.
1482	10349	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the winter hibiscus, blooming unexpectedly, gave her some hope amidst her disappointment. Also, because her mother, instead of scolding her, was understanding about her failing the test and even offered words of encouragement, the author felt a sense of relief and renewed determination. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph, highlighting the combined effect of nature's resilience and her mother's support in alleviating her despair and fostering a more positive outlook.
1483	10350	4	3	"The author concludes the story with optimism and hope for the future. She finishes her story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" By concluding the story in that way it helps demonstrate the hope the hibiscus plant brought to her after she failed her drivers test. The hibiscus helped give Saeng one step closer to adapting to her new home. It says in the story “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, [were] almost familiar to her now.” In the way the author ends the story it helps give inspiration for a new beginning and new season, highlighting Saeng's growing sense of belonging and her resolve to try again, fueled by the cyclical promise of renewal."
1484	10351	4	3	In the story, @ORGANIZATION1, by Minfong Ho, a girl named Saeng tries to adjust to a new country, but it is nearly impossible. She is stressed about failing the driverís test, and she realizes that nothing is the same. Except for one thing that she quickly recognized: a plant called the ìWinter Hibiscus.î It made her think of her old life in Vietnam. It helped her get through hard times and she didnít want to give up on anything. This is exactly why Minfong Ho ends the last paragraph by stating that Saeng will retry the driving test when the hibiscus is budding. The flower gives her a thought of home in Vietnam, making her try and try again. Also, the author ends the story like this to state a theme. This particular theme is, ìNo matter how hard something might be, you can get through it. You just have to find a way that benefits you most.î The hibiscus, therefore, is more than just a flower; it is a symbol of hope and resilience, reminding Saeng of her strength and determination to succeed in her new life.
1485	10352	4	3	The author comes back to that paragraph because in the story Saeng is so sorry she did not ACE the test. Now Saeng wants to make up for it, She vowed to herself she will ACE that test. For example, when I say to myself I am going to get sumthin done I do what it takes to get it done and I don't give up when things get rough, PERSISTENCE, This last sentence is what the main idea of the story is, To make up that test and ACE it, To get done what needs to be done, showing the importance of perseverance in achieving goals.
1486	10353	4	3	The reason why this author includes this story with this paragraph is because it is still talking about Saeng, and that is more like her, reflecting that she has a mind like a butterfly that was trapped but burst out. This mirrors the open discussion Saeng and her mom had. As a teenage girl, the author and Saeng relate to a similar experience, helping to illustrate Saeng's character and the author's connection to her.
1487	10354	4	3	In the story ìWinter Hibiscusî by Minfong Ho, I think the ending paragraph is there to show that Saeng has not given up. She says, ìWhen they come backÖthen I will take that test again.î She is talking about the hibiscus and the geese. The things that remind her of home, Laos, and her culture. When the reminders of home come and give her strength, she will have the power to take the test. This shows that even though she has failed, facing a challenging new environment, she will not give up and she will try again. I think that is the purpose of the paragraph. To show Saeng hasn't given up and that she finds resilience in remembering her roots.
1488	10355	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story like that is because he is telling the reader that after the snow leaves the author will begin to plant more plants. The test is to make sure his plants donít die during next winter. This signals a cycle of growth and learning, suggesting a renewed commitment to nurturing life even after facing seasonal challenges, highlighting the author's hope for future success in gardening.
1489	10356	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Ho, the author is stating that Saeng is happy when she is around the plant and she finds peace with the plant because it brings back childhood memories. For example, “And that rich sweet scent, that was familiar to her.” She loved the way it made her feel. When one of the leaves fell off and she breathed in, it reminded her of her grandmother. Ho might have experienced something like this. Ho might have wrote this because the story could relate to other people who moved from another country and have something that brought back memories. Everytime that I touch or smell a sweater, it brings back memories of my grandmother. I feel that he wrote this because of his personal experience and it could relate to others, showing how sensory details tied to objects can evoke powerful memories and a sense of connection to the past, particularly for immigrants.
1490	10357	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show how some people vowed silently because they don't want to express themselves, also maybe because they are not very trustful of people, even themselves. One day I was like that; I didn't want to talk to anybody. All I wanted to do was sit in my room and think, think about my life, where I am going to go after I die. I just would sit in my room in the dark wondering if I would come back in another body or will my soul roam the earth. But then I started thinking that I am a kid, I got a wonderful life ahead of me, and when I get to the one where I need to think about then I would. So I started talking to everybody again, realizing the importance of connection.
1491	10358	4	3	The author concludes this story by saying this statement because the author wants you to feel like the character in the book is determined and resilient. The author is trying to put across a statement saying even when facing hardship, get through it and then try again. The character is not giving up, and she will get through the test even though it's hard, demonstrating an unwavering spirit.
1492	10359	4	3	Gardening is something I'm hoping to improve upon this spring. My mom always had such a green thumb, and I aspire to cultivate that same skill.
1493	10360	4	3	The reason why is so you get the feeling that Saeng feels about gardening. She is praying for spring to come so she can do it over again, eager for the renewal it brings. She likes to watch plants grow from tiny seeds and become something you can eat and share. That is way the author concluded the story with this paragraph, leaving the reader with a sense of Saeng's anticipation and the simple joy she finds in nurturing life.
1494	10361	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show determination and hope. The geese and the hibiscus symbolize Saeng’s determination, because they always come back no matter what. Saeng will be back to take the test, just like the geese will also be back. The hibiscus also symbolizes her because it has faced adversity also. It has been taken to new places and had new homes, much like Saeng, and has a harsh winter coming in the near future. However, it always finds a way to come back and bloom in the spring, which is what Saeng hopes to do by taking the driver’s test. The author included the last paragraph to show symbolism between Saeng, the geese, and the hibiscus, highlighting her resilience and optimism for the future. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
1495	10362	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he is basically trying to say that everything happens for a reason, and that reason might manifest through seasons. She might think that she would have done better on her test in the spring only for the simple fact that everything blooms in the spring, leading her to believe in a correlation where none necessarily exists, thus reinforcing the idea of finding meaning even in coincidental timing.
1496	10363	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she can go through these obstacles, specifically adjusting to a new environment, even though she moved from her homeland. Also, it shows that she has more confidence in navigating unfamiliar situations and building a new life, which is why the author concluded her story with that paragraph, highlighting her resilience and newfound self-assurance.
1497	10364	4	3	"ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again. The story also mentions, ""One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it."" This suggests she finds hope and renewal in the natural cycle, and will persevere, retaking the test when spring, a symbol of rebirth, arrives, showing her determination."
1498	10365	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this because that one paragraph basically sums the whole story up. ""When the snow melts and the geese return"" basically goes back to the beginning of the story when Saeng started planting. This cyclical imagery emphasizes the continuous nature of life and farming, reflecting the enduring spirit of the community and its connection to the land. This is why the author gave the story its ending, providing a sense of closure and highlighting the ongoing cycle of nature and human endeavor."
1499	10366	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a few reasons. First, the test is important to Saeng so that she can prove to herself that she is able to pass it, showcasing her internal desire for validation and self-improvement after facing previous challenges. Ending with this paragraph also gives the reader some suspense as to whether Saeng will pass or even go to take the test again, leaving her future uncertain and the audience wondering about the resolution of her goals. Lastly, this paragraph shows Saeng's personality traits. It shows that she is persistent, determined, and strong-willed, highlighting her resilience in the face of adversity and solidifying the reader's understanding of her character.
1500	10367	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" at the end of the story the author writes ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, In the spring, when the snow melt and geese return and this hibiscus Is budding, then I will take the test again."" The reason why the author said that Is because she Is trying to tell the readers to get right back up and do it again, If you fell once there Is no harm and trying again. When its spring and the birds aren't flying south, she promise to take the drive's test. After failing a driver test Saeng buys a flower at a florIst that remInded her of Vietnam. She takes it home and put it in the garden. Told her mother that she fail, Saeng's mother was very understand and told her maybe next time. Saeng associates the return of spring and the blooming hibiscus with a renewed sense of hope and determination. In conclusion the author writes the last paragraph as a moral to never give up and keep trying until you accomplish your goals in life."
1501	10368	4	3	The author concludes the story that way so she can keep everyone wondering. I believe she ended that way to let us know that she will be back, and when she comes back she will be ready for everything, including that test. She left us wondering because when she does come back, she is going to want us to read about what happened upon her return and what happened when she aced the test. She only made that vow to herself, and nobody else, because if she did, she would have let them down if she failed. That is why she concludes the story that way, leaving the specifics of her success as a future reveal.
1502	10369	4	3	The author ends the story with this because she is saying she will be around next year to take the test again. She is saying how she wants to be around when the plants grow in the garden. She mostly wants to see the hibiscus grow and bloom, revealing its vibrant colors. Because she appreciates and likes nature so much, finding solace and inspiration in it, she wants to be around again to see them grow, signifying her hope for the future and her connection to the natural world.
1503	10370	4	3	The author concludes the story with this final paragraph to show how sentimental and important the plant is to Saeng. She will take that test again when the winter is over because it's too cold for nice hibiscus to survive. You need a winter hibiscus. “Not like the kind we had before”(@NUM1). This shows how important it is that she finds a hibiscus like the ones she had at home, a tangible link to her past and a symbol of resilience. She shows disappointment in herself until that last paragraph when she shows courage and strong will, determined to find a way to nurture a piece of her home in this new, unfamiliar environment, highlighting her enduring spirit.
1504	10371	4	3	"When they come back, Saeng vowed to silently herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author concluded this story in such a way that it makes the reader ask questions, much like in the ""@CAPS1's @ORGANIZATION1"" when there was a modernist way to interprete means of a sty by making the reader ask questions instead of that being a moral to the story. For example in the ""@CAPS1's @ORGANIZATION1"" the main character @PERSON1 runs away and all we could get as a slaming door. Much like in this story there is a twist in that what test is the main character talking about? Is she going to try to move with friends? Is this like a resolution she is making to herself? Also, this leaves the reader wanting more of the story so that they might go back and even read it again. Thus, the author's use of ambiguity effectively draws the reader into the narrative and encourages further engagement with the text."
1505	10372	4	3	"The ""Winter Hibiscus"" is a relatively sad, but hopeful story that uses lots of symbols. The author concluded the story with a confident ending that makes the reader feel satisfied. The two reasons he wrote this conclusion paragraph is to give the ending a hopeful tone and relate the objects she sees to the spring. ""Winter Hibiscus"" ends with a hopeful tone thanks to the confident vow Saeng silently makes. She had a rough day, and the author wanted to make sure she had something to look to as a goal. It also reveals how strong of a person Saeng is, highlighting her resilience in the face of adversity. The author uses this conclusion paragraph to leave the reader with a hopeful and confident tone. The second reason the author concluded with that conclusion paragraph was to relate some of the objects she sees to the spring. The geese represent the new place she is living in, and the hibiscus represents her old home. This paragraph links these two symbols together, so the reader can relate them to the spring season and the idea of renewal. The way the author concluded the story was brilliantly done, as the ending represents a hopeful tone, and symbols that relate to spring, ultimately leaving the reader satisfied with its confident and optimistic close."
1506	10373	4	3	I think the author concludes with this paragraph because she wants to not give up. For example, she wants to show us to never give up at anything even if you fail. Therefore, that’s why she ends like that, instilling a sense of perseverance in the reader by highlighting the importance of resilience.
1507	10374	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wanted to get her point across, and also because she wanted to create an understanding of the complexities of the passage. The author wanted the reader to feel her message as if they were there to witness it, aiming for a more profound and lasting impact by immersing them in the scene and emotions.
1508	10375	4	3	"The author concluded the story with the sentence, because the author wanted to show that since Saeng found the flower she has new hope and reason for passing the test. The flower gave her inspiration because it made her look back on her home in Vietnam ""I mean, not like the kind we had at-at"" she found that she was still too shakey to say the words ""at home"". When Saeng brought the plant to her new home and planted it in the garden it was like bringing a little piece of Vietnam home which made her feel better. The overall inspiration and the memories the flower held for Saeng made her feel better about her new home and gave her a reason to start fresh with her driving test, suggesting a brighter future fueled by cherished memories."
1509	10376	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is saying that when the flowers come back in the spring, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding after winter, she will garden them again, finding solace and renewal in the familiar rhythms of nature and the promise of new growth.
1510	10377	4	3	The author of ìwinter Hibiscusî concludes the story with ìwhen they come back, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.î Saeng, because it creates the mood that Saeng is accepting the changes in her life. Just like nature adapts to climate and location change, Saeng seems to appreciate her situation and is deciding to make it a positive instead of a negative. The author is showing that if you're having trouble, try again; through the main character, Saeng, who finds hope in the cyclical nature of the seasons, mirroring her own resilience and determination.
1511	10378	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for a lot of different reasons. One reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because, after reflection, she might try it again, perhaps approaching the challenge with a different strategy. A second reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably wanted to try to make her mother proud, seeking her approval and understanding through renewed effort. A third reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably really felt that she really disappointed herself, and is determined to overcome that feeling. In conclusion, if you mess up on something, try again; maybe you will do a lot better, and ultimately find success and satisfaction.
1512	10379	4	3	Minfong Ho concluded ìWinter Hibiscusî with the lines ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test againî to show that there is always hope for better things to come. Saeng had become sad because she remembered her home in Vietnam. She longed for her natural home and familiarity. Her missed memories agonizingly hurt Saeng because she was now far away and in a different world. However, the author started to reveal hints that America would accept Saeng and find some childhood memories there too. ìOverhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and ñyes- familiar to Saeng now.î Already, Saeng was growing familiar with her surrounding area in America. Her hibiscus would keep her VIETNAMESE culture, tradition, and memories alive, as the geese would help her feel happy and accustomed in America. As one kept her VIETNAMESE culture alive through memories, she would continue a successful life and pass her test, showcasing her resilience. That is why Minfong Ho ended ìWinter Hibiscusî with the particular paragraph.
1513	10380	4	3	"The author concludes the story in *Winter Hibiscus* in a way that is kind of funny and weird. The concluding sentence is: ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The title is referenced in the concluding sentence, so it is basically concluding the whole story, plus the character's determination. She will try again when winter is over."
1514	10381	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator is ready. The narrator tried the test once and failed, feeling dejected after the setback. She bought herself a flower to cheer herself up, a small act of self-care. Her mother talked to her and offered encouragement, which helped the narrator regain her confidence and perspective, and then she felt better. She felt determined to pass the driving test, displaying a newfound resilience, just like the flower was determined to survive, demonstrating her readiness to face the challenge again.
1515	10382	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it symbolizes the change in Saeng as well as other things. The snow always melts when the seasons change. The geese always come back when the seasons change. The hibiscus will bud when the seasons change. Saeng will try again when the seasons change. But she’ll be a different person also, having learned from her experiences. Knowing that everything will change but stay the same on the inside, Saeng decides she will too. She has more of an appreciation for home now after seeing the hibiscus and remembering her past.
1516	10383	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î The author shows that Saeng will take the test again, demonstrating her resilience. She will be ready and she will pass the test, fueled by the cyclical renewal of nature mirroring her own determination. Also, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it ends the story knowing that she will take the test over again, revealing her newfound resolve. So, she knows she has faith to take the test again and make her mother proud that she passed, highlighting the importance of familial pride in her journey.
1517	10384	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring it's warmer and more fun, plus she will have time to study her stuff in winter for the springtime activities. Also, because like she says in the story, the imagery of spring goes along with the conclusion at the end that she finally understood what was going on, so she connected it to the way the geese are, symbolizing a fresh start and newfound understanding. The return of spring thus mirrors her own personal renewal and growth.
1518	10385	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it's what she solemly promised herself, a reflection of the personal commitment she undertook to honestly portray the characters and their experiences. This final note serves as a reminder of her artistic integrity and dedication to the narrative's truth, reinforcing the emotional impact she aimed to create.
1519	10386	4	3	In ìWinter Hibiscusî by Minfong Ho, the authorís purpose in concluding the story with ìWhen they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again,î was to show how the hibiscus and the other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. ìPlants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.î This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, ìHow strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs. ìThis symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. She feels confined by the unfamiliar environment. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as ìstrong enough to make it through the cold monthsî. Saeng identifies herself with this description, and so decided that when the hibiscus is done dealing with the bad stuff, she will have, also, and will have budded and grown just like her plant. Then, she will be ready to achieve her goal, showing that she believes she, like the hibiscus, can overcome her current challenges and bloom again.
1520	10387	4	3	"The author concluded the story with ""when they come back,"" Saeng vowed silently to herself, ""in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Saeng believes that if the hibiscus can survive through hard times and adapt to changes, and survive, she can also. Saeng knows that even though she has moved to the United States and it is different, she is strong enough to survive. Failing her driver's test doesn't mean that she is incapable of anything, but that she needs to try again with a fresh start, just like the hibiscus, demonstrating resilience and a renewed sense of hope."
1521	10388	4	3	The author concludes the story with this, showing the author wants to show Saeng hasn’t given up. Early in the story, Saeng goes to the greenhouse and starts to cry after a setback. When she gets home she says to her mother, “I-I failed the test.” Despite this, Saeng wanted to go back and try again, demonstrating resilience. That is why the author ended with that paragraph, emphasizing her enduring determination.
1522	10389	4	3	The last paragraph was added in order to represent the determinedness and adapting to new things in Saeng and her family. In the beginning, Saeng held bitterness at failing the test. But after she remembers her homeland through the flower she accepts it. Just as the flower will bud, she will be a new person and thus pass the test. An example of her being determined to deal with it is that she does make friends, and, though the food she offered was rejected she didn’t give in. The moment of breakdown was as she got the flower, the tangible reminder of her past and the challenge ahead. After she got home it was over with and again she accepts the change, demonstrating a resilient spirit that suggests future success and happiness in her new environment.
1523	10390	4	3	The author include the last paragraph because Saeng is not going to give up and she will try again. I think Saeng bought the flower because she had them at her homeland, and seeing them may offer some comfort and familiarity as she adjusts to her new life. For example, Saeng started to cry because she miss her homeland, suggesting a deep longing for her roots. This purchase signifies her resilience and determination to create a sense of home, even amidst her challenges.
1524	10391	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he thinks when the flowers come back they would be better. I think that he thinks that it would be a better test next time, suggesting a renewed hope for Charlie's potential and the experiment's success in the future.
1525	10392	4	3	The author concludes ìWinter Hibiscusî with the paragraph because it continues the theme of adjusting to changes in life. In the story, Saeng has come to the United States from Vietnam and it is quite a change, a cultural shift that requires adaptation. Also changed are the plants in this new environment. The hibiscus reminds Saeng of Vietnam, providing a familiar link to her past, but it is different, reflecting her own evolving identity. The mother in the story says, ìIts flowers arenít as pretty, but itís strong enough to make it through the cold winter months here, this winter hibiscus. ìThe hibiscus also relates to the theme because it is able to adjust to changes, mirroring Saeng's resilience. The final paragraph talks about snow melting, geese returning and the hibiscus budding, all symbolic of renewal. These are all changes the author uses to connect to the theme of embracing new beginnings. This adds more understanding to the storyís message about finding strength in adaptation. Additionally, the tone of the last paragraph is hopeful, suggesting a bright future, which gives the reader a positive feeling. The tone adds to the theme of the story, reinforcing the idea that change can bring growth and promise.
1526	10393	4	3	He failed the test. She said she would try next year, when the geese come back, their honking a promise of warmer days and another chance. It was a small comfort, but a comfort nonetheless, offering hope for a brighter future.
1527	10394	4	3	I think he means that seasons change and that winter will come again, implying a cyclical nature to events. I think that is the test, a test of patience and understanding of inevitable change. Therefore, accepting the return of winter becomes the key to passing this test.
1528	10395	4	3	I thinks that the author concludes the story with the given paragraph to show that she is similar to the hibiscus and geese. First, the geese and hibiscus both have a goal, which is to survive the winters. Geese fly south for the winter to stay warm and find food. This is similar to Saeng, whose thing both moved to a different environment where they must adapt. Also, Saeng must experience winter along with the hibiscus, facing a literal change in season and a figurative change in her life. The hibiscus needs to be strong, to overcome winter; from this, it shows Saeng is like her hibiscus because she needs to be strong to overcome the test. If her hibiscus can overcome its test, winter, then she can survive to conquer her own challenges, just as the hibiscus perseveres and blooms again.
1529	10396	4	3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” includes “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again because it shows that she can adapt to change and still can think about her old country too. An example of how she can keep her old country alive in her life is” “But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac.” This shows that she can still eat the foods she ate back at her old home and try new things at her new home. This blending of preferences highlights her ability to embrace her heritage while engaging with her present reality. In conclusion the excerpt shows that the author can put both cultures together and be happy.
1530	10397	4	3	There could be many reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. There could be many different meanings of this paragraph that could have importance to the story. I think that the author includes this to say that when the spring comes, she will have many more reasons to take the driving test. You can break this paragraph down to mean many different things. I interpreted it to mean that when the spring comes back, she will have a new beginning. The snow melting away represents all the hardship she faced in the previous year. The geese returning and the hibiscus budding means that they are also coming back to start the new year. They are too coming back, getting ready to start their new life, perhaps stronger than before. It is included at the end to show how Saeng is trying to forget about how she failed the test. She is using this time now to prepare for the next time she is going to take the driving test. She thinks that once she forgets all of the bad things she went through the previous year, and embraces the new opportunities, she'll be ready. She had to move on and be able to pass the driving test the next time around. The author concluded the story with the paragraph to show how Saeng plans to solve her problems, with a fresh perspective and renewed hope. The way you interpret the paragraph gives you different ideas about what it is trying to say. I think that it is showing a new beginning that she will have to go through the next year, one filled with potential and the chance to overcome past failures.
1531	10398	4	3	...when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She would not be caught unprepared. The knowledge she had gained, the lessons learned from this experience, would serve her well. She would use the winter months to study, to practice, to hone her skills, so that she would be ready, truly ready, to face the challenge again and prove her worth.
1532	10399	4	3	The author ended the story ìWinter Hibiscusî with Saeng vowing to retake the test. He ended it this way to show the themes of this story. One theme of the story is to never give up. Just like the winter Hibiscus has to last through the long winter but it does survive, and it inspires Saeng to keep trying, even after facing initial disappointment. Another theme is to overcome your obstacles. The flower faces many dangers, such as the cold and the snow, but still manages to blossom, symbolizing resilience. Saeng wants to overcome her obstacles and pass the test, which is a significant challenge in her new environment. Therefore the ending of the story displays the themes of perseverance and the ability to flourish even when facing adversity, solidifying the message.
1533	10400	4	3	The author concludes this part, because it made the story stand out a little. For example when Saeng said that she ment when the plants came back. It also gave the ending a little something to hang on two, rather than staping on talking about the v or geese to get the reader off topic. Last she also ment when the geese came back, offering a sense of cyclical return and hope that resonates beyond the immediate narrative.
1534	10401	4	3	I think the author finishes the story with that, signaling the girls see this plant as a symbol of strength and faith, so she will take the test next year when it comes back; she truly likes the plant and hopes it will bring her luck. Thus, the plant's symbolism becomes a source of motivation and optimism for her future endeavors.
1535	10402	4	3	"I think the author ended the story with that phrase to show that she won't give up; no matter how hard it is, she keeps trying. The girl says in the story ""I failed the test,"" and then at the end of the story says she will take that test again, so she is not willing to fail forever. The author's choice highlights resilience. I also think the author ended the story with that paragraph to make you wonder if she will ever pass the test, leaving the reader with a sense of anticipation about the girl's future endeavors."
1536	10403	4	3	I think the author writes this because whatever test she has to take she wasn't ready for before, but now whenever the geese and the hibiscus return, she will be ready to take the test. Maybe she wasn't mentally prepared, lacking the confidence or focus needed to succeed. So, in conclusion, I think when she says the geese and the hibiscus return, she will take the test, suggesting she wasn't physically and mentally prepared for it previously, but now she is ready to tackle it.
1537	10404	4	3	Authors chose their closing paragraphs carefully. The author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the character’s eyes. There are reasons the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph. The author's choice of the ending paragraph is very important. The character says “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The hibiscus that she mentions represents the ability to overcome obstacles. In the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it, and thus the hibiscus symbolizes her resilience. That is why the author concludes with that. The author also writes, “when the snow melts and the geese return”. This to the character represents new beginnings and chances, suggesting the cyclical nature of life and opportunity. That gives the character the sense that next time around she will pass the test. The author adds that paragraph in the end to symbolize new beginnings and chances and the ability to overcome obstacles, offering a message of hope. Authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons, and this author did as well. The author did it to symbolize things, ultimately leaving the reader with a feeling of optimism and the potential for future success.
1538	10405	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of a saying that when it's cold and silent she's reserved to herself, enjoying the quiet introspection of winter. But when the snow melts and spring is here, she's outgoing and does lots of fun things, embracing the vibrancy and social opportunities that warmer weather brings. This contrast highlights her adaptability and the different facets of her personality that emerge with the changing seasons, ultimately showing her as a well-rounded individual.
1539	10406	4	3	I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph because the geese that flew down south in a beautiful V formation, fly down every season. So she tells herself, like the consistent return of the geese, she will take the test again when the geese return and the hibiscus plant is budding. For example, she thinks to herself, ìAlmost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.î Like the familiar return of the geese each year, looking up at the geese she is almost reminded of an experience she went through somewhat similar, a challenge she will face again with the cyclical nature of life offering another opportunity. This reinforces the theme of resilience and the acceptance of repeated cycles in life.
1540	10407	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph: ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again to emphasize that you can overcome a defeat or failure by waiting until the ""season"" comes again for you to re-endure."" Basically, the hibiscus meant much to the narrator and her mother, who was dying, and they dug up a hole to help it grow, so when it grows again, that proves that it will be living better. So when Saeng relates the test, that will be her having the opportunity to pass the test, just as the hibiscus will have another chance to flourish. The story with this paragraph symbolizes a new beginning about to take place, a situation that will come again that will help you to get what is needed out of it that you missed. The story and the paragraph emphasize life's cyclical nature, the promise of renewal after hardship."
1541	10408	4	3	She can't wait till the flowers start to come back when the snow melts, meaning it isn't very cold out anymore, so they grow. She is going to take her test that she has failed when the geese and flowers come back, a hopeful sign of a fresh start and a chance for success.
1542	10409	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph to show that Saeng, like the geese and the hibiscus, will return again and have hope. Saeng is a little depressed in the story because she is in a new country and just failed her driving test. The hibiscus plant in the florist shop brings back painful emotional memories for her, but at the same time, is very comforting, reminding her of home. Later in the story, she plants the hibiscus outside in the garden with her mother, grounding herself in her new environment. As her mother goes inside, Saeng watches the geese fly overhead, a symbol of migration and cyclical return. ìAlmost reluctantly, (Saeng) realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her. Like the geese.î Saeng knew the geese would return in the spring, just like she would to her driving test. The hibiscus would be in bloom again too to provide her with hope, representing resilience and the promise of renewal. This is what the final paragraph in the story ìwinter hibiscusî means, suggesting that Saeng, too, will find her place and bloom again in this new land.
1543	10410	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng's everlasting determination. This idea of her determination to succeed can be connected to the plant she brings home. The plant she knew grew wild where she used to live, but she found it potted in the United States, which is limiting its growth, just like Saeng's new country seems unordinary, and she feels out of place. However, just as she intends to nurture the plant and help it thrive, she demonstrates her resolve to adapt and flourish in her new environment, showcasing her enduring spirit.
1544	10411	4	3	The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself she’ll take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that “many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.” And when she’s in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother. Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to Minnesota, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the Iowa and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re-taking the test because it demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and foreshadows her future success and adaptation to an American lifestyle.
1545	10412	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph that she did because it was the end and the start of a new beginning. The author uses the senses in her story. The winter is the current season and spring is on its way. Although Saeng failed her test in the winter when most things die, she is looking forward to spring to start again on her test. The geese will return and the hibiscus will bud to show spring is here with new life. Saeng will also have new life in her test to pass it this time and drive. The spring season will come and new life will be provided to all, signifying hope and the cyclical nature of opportunity.
1546	10413	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is like saying most of the story but in a small and shorter way, encapsulating the central themes and plot points with brevity. It serves as a microcosm of the larger narrative, echoing earlier conflicts and resolutions. In effect, it provides a final, concentrated dose of the story's essence, allowing the reader to reflect on the journey and appreciate the narrative's overall impact.
1547	10414	4	3	This paragraph is a good way to end the story because it relates to the test. The narrator says she will try again in the spring, armed with a better understanding of the material and a renewed sense of determination to pass the challenging exam, showing her resilience.
1548	10415	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it's what the story is all about; it just explains what happened in the end as if what happened through the story was the growth and living of a flower. It signifies the completion of a cycle, from seed to bloom and perhaps eventual withering, mirroring the character's journey and ultimate fate. It provides a sense of closure and understanding, reflecting the natural progression that has been subtly present throughout the narrative.
1549	10416	4	3	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the story in what seems like an incomplete paragraph. The girl, Saeng, vows to take her driver's test over when spring comes. Holding the plant, she felt cold and helpless, mirroring the plant's condition. ""Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind."" Saeng's mother reassuring her that she was okay with her choice fostered Saeng's personal growth. ""I'm glad you got it,"" her mother says, adding, ""look how root-bound it is, poor thing."" This subtly reflects Saeng's clinging to her connection with her country. Her mother's assurance that the plant will surely survive foreshadows Saeng's resilience. When spring arrives, the plant will be strong once more, and so too will Saeng, which is why the author ends the story where she does, leaving the reader with the hopeful image of renewed strength and a future where Saeng, like the hibiscus, will flourish."
1550	10417	4	3	The author concludes the story by showing the girlís connection to the plant and the symbolism of the geese; the ìWinter hibiscusî is her connection to her homeland and represents her resilience. She said sheíll retake her driving test when her plant buds and is brave, so she will do the same, drawing strength from its blooming. The geese flying south show her journey as a person because she will take the test when the geese come back from their journey, symbolizing a return and a new beginning, as she comes back from hers, transformed and ready.
1551	10418	4	3	The author wrote the ending paragraph the way she did for many reasons. The main reason for this is because she wanted to end the story on a lighter note. All throughout the story there was depresing nogistalistic tone that made the reader yearn for the past. The author wanted to put on emphisis on being strong even though you @MONTH1 not enjoy where you are at. Also the author wanted to show the strength of the main character Saeng. Even though she has just failed a test in a new, strange world she still wishes to continue pushing foward. This adds more demension the the character and makes her less static and more dynamic. This makes the ending much more impactful. This is a very good story to read if you are homesick and need something to push you forward.
1552	10420	4	3	The author concludes with that statement because it shows she needs time. She needs time to adjust to her new home, much like the transplanted hibiscus needs time to get some roots in the new soil it is on. When she is at the orchard, she sees the hibiscus and has memories of her old home, making her cry but yet feel good at the same time, signaling a complex emotional process of adapting to change. This period of adjustment, with its bittersweet memories, is essential for her to truly settle and thrive in her new environment.
1553	10421	4	3	I believe the author concludes that passage to show patience. Saeng was to wait for spring; maybe it will feel like her hometown again. She likes the spring better than the winter because she likes the birds and the geese that return in spring, whereas they go away in winter. That way, I believe the author concludes that passage by offering a sense of hope tied to the cyclical return of spring.
1554	10422	4	3	ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î The author has left her home and moved to another country. She is now in an unfamilar place. Everything that now surrounds her is new and mostly un-known. By ending the story with this quote, it suggest that the author still has hope of adapting to her new home. When she left her home, she did not just leave a building behind. She left her home, people she loved, and an endless list of memories. At times she might have felt out of place because she was no longer in her comfort zone. She is now ìout of the box,î and in a whole new world. When she saw the hibiscus, the exotic plant took her back to her memories and to the love of her old home. Then she came back to reality and broke apart with sadness and ìfailed her test.î The ending sentence shows that the author is willing to try to survive in this new place and that she is still determined to pass her own test of adapting, indicating a resilient spirit and a refusal to be defeated by the challenges of a new beginning.
1555	10423	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself., in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" meaning that she will retake the test and hopes to pass, aiming to make her mother happy and provide support. She chose spring, symbolizing the rebirth of nature, as she desires to retake the test with a clear and renewed mind. The author likely placed this paragraph at the end to leave the reader with a sense of hope and Saeng's determination for the future."
1556	10424	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story Saeng struggles with her past and overcoming it, specifically the trauma of leaving her grandmother and homeland. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldnít help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, ìI-I failed the test.î When she says ìthe testî she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it, showing her perceived inability to move forward. In the concluding paragraph Saeng says she will retake the test. She said, ìWhen the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î This promise of renewal and future attempts offers a hopeful resolution. In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces, suggesting a path towards healing and acceptance.
1557	10425	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to end the story with hope. For example, since she has moved to the United States, she feels homesick. To make it worse, she failed the driver’s test. ìShe found she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. ì This quote helps add to the homesick girl. She concludes with this paragraph to show that when spring comes, she’ll start out fresh and re-live her life in America, suggesting a brighter future despite her current struggles.
1558	10426	4	3	The author concluded this story with the paragraph because Saeng is explaining to the reader that she will take the test again when the time is right. When things seem to be getting better, and she feels more prepared and less burdened by external pressures, she will retake the test. That is why the author used that paragraph to conclude her story, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and Saeng's resilient determination.
1559	10427	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" written by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator goes to a greenhouse filled with many flowers, but a ""winter"" hibiscus plant particularly catches her eye. This plant reminds her of her homeland and everything that used to take place there; specifically, the hibiscus reminds her of her grandmother's long, silky gray hair and how she used to watch her dry it in the sun. Afterwards, she would help her knot it up into a bun with a bud of this plant tucked within it. The author ends the story with this memory because it counters her earlier statement, ""I-I failed the test,"" and suggests resilience and hope, as the final line states, ""...then I will take the test again,"" showing that she is not defeated by this setback."
1560	10428	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" the girl Saeng failed the drivers test. ""I-I failed the test"" said Saeng. She had bought a hibiscus because the flower reminded her of some of the memories from home, particularly the hibiscus she had at her house. At the end, she says that she will retake the test when the geese come back, the snow has melted and the hibiscus is budding. She does this, I think, because she needs time to just think things through, to just remember back home, and to make a hibiscus garden. The hibiscus in this story is just like Saeng. They both experienced something difficult; Saeng failed the test and the hibiscus was constricted to a pot, away from its natural environment. But they both are going to change the bad thing, as Saeng will retake the test and the hibiscus will hopefully flourish. Thus, both Saeng and the hibiscus represent resilience and the hope for a brighter future."
1561	10429	4	3	In the story ìWinter Hibiscusî by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the paragraph in that way to convey the determination and new found motivation Saeng found by buying the familiar plant. Although she failed her test, finding a plant that reminded her of her home and her grandmother instilled motivation in her to try the test again, she wanted to make her new home in a new country workout for the better, no matter what. ìShe lifted her head and watched as their distinctive u was etched against the evening sky ...î the author included details about the geese to represent moving on. The geese will go, and come back, just like Saeng. She failed the test the first time, but getting the plant and seeing the birds motivated her to try again. ìAlmost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become ...familiar to her.î The geese were one of the things mentioned that has become very familiar to her, in her new home. Concluding the story with a bit about the geese conveys to the reader that she is slowly but surely learning how to adapt to her strange new home, embracing aspects she once considered foreign. Finding the plant helped her, because it was already familiar to her. ìSaeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. ë@CAPS1, Saeng said.í ìAfter failing her driverís test, walking into the floristís shop and finding that plant comforted her. It made this new place feel closer to home than it did at first. The geese had become familiar over time, and finding the plant was simply comforting, serving as a bridge between her past and present. Concluding the story that way showed the reader that she was adapting and learning to deal with a tough situation in a comforting way, highlighting her resilience and growing sense of belonging.
1562	10430	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". The author concluded the story with that because she is saying that when the year starts off and starts over, that she will too. She's saying that when the geese come back, the snow melts, and the Hibiscus starts to bud that they all start over and start a new beginning. So when she goes to take the test it will be a new year, a fresh start, filled with renewed hope and determination after the long winter."
1563	10431	4	3	The author of Winter Hibiscus ended her story with words regarding to the story CAPS1 failed her driving test. Saeng cried when noticing her past through flower. As well as bought dok malik seeds show that the story ended the way it did, because next season she anticipates cultivating a future different from her past.
1564	10432	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is determined. She says that she is going to take the test again, which shows that she is determined to eventually pass. Even though Saeng failed her driver's test, she is not going to give up on getting her license.
1565	10433	4	3	The author used that sentence because the snow is melting and the geese are coming back, signs of the changing season. The flowers were budding up, further emphasizing the arrival of spring, and that is why I think the author used that sentence to evoke a sense of renewal and hope.
1566	10434	4	3	"I believe that this was a good ending to the story. When Saeng says ìWhen they come backî she is talking about the flowers, when they come back alive. ìIn the springî shows when the flower will come back. ìWhen the snows melt and the geese returnî she is saying that after winter (when the snows melts) and when the geese return(in spring). ìAnd this Hibiscus is buddingî She is saying when the flowers blume again in the spring. ì Then I will take the test again,"" she is saying after all this happens she will retake the test (in the spring). This shows that Saeng will be watching at all these things happening and count down till spring again, so she can retake the test. She is ready for spring to be here, so that she can study and pass the test, and work at the flower shop. This anticipation demonstrates her renewed determination and hope, solidifying her resolve to achieve her aspirations after the winter months have passed. This will be her goal for the winter, till spring comes!"
1567	10435	4	3	The author concluded the story with that ending because in the spring when everything blossoms, reflecting a time of renewal and hope. And she wouldn't be focused while there is snow, a symbol of the cold, harsh realities she's trying to overcome. So when the hibiscus is budding, representing new beginnings, that's when she will be able to take her test again. I think he wrote that because it means something to her, a personal goal intertwined with the natural cycle of growth and a chance to finally achieve what she desires.
1568	10436	4	3	This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, ìShe lifted her head.î This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds. The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time. When she says, ìwhen the snow melts and the geese return,î this shows us that she is like the geese because their both going back for a hard fought journey. Also, when she says, ìand this hibiscus buddingî she is saying when everything comes to life and is at itís highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up, revealing her resilient spirit. Although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring.
1569	10437	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of reasons. It offers a sense of closure, resolving the central conflict and leaving the reader with a definitive outcome regarding the protagonist's journey. This finality ensures that the narrative arc is complete, providing satisfaction and preventing lingering questions about the character's fate. Furthermore, it reinforces the overarching theme of the story, highlighting the key message or moral that the author intended to convey, thus solidifying the story's impact.
1570	10438	4	3	Saeng is @CAPS1 that it will be a longtime before she will worry about school work again. That's why the author concludes the story with that paragraph, suggesting a period of carefree relaxation ahead.
1571	10439	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because he wants to emphasize that the girl is not completely dissatisfied with leaving her home. He ended with that because he wanted to show that there is hope for her to learn to love her new home, suggesting a possibility of future contentment despite her initial reluctance.
1572	10440	4	3	The author ends the story with this sentence because Saeng needs a break before she takes the test again. Saeng is comparing herself to indifferent things, like flowers, and the experience of taking a test. That comparison highlights her exhaustion and need for respite, and that is significant. That's why the author ends the story with this sentence, emphasizing the simple, restorative power of pausing and reflecting before facing the challenge again.
1573	10441	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show that the girl is going to be like the hibiscus. Just as the hibiscus will bloom again, the next time it blooms the girl will be ready for the test and will take it again and will pass. The author wants to show that the girl will not give up and will try again to make sure she passes. The author involves the hibiscus to show that the girl and the flower will bloom the same time the hibiscus will, suggesting a parallel growth and readiness, and will pass the test, symbolizing her eventual success.
1574	10442	4	3	Well, I think the author concludes the story with that sentence because maybe Saeng likes the spring and can concentrate better with her favorite flower that she thinks relates to her life, offering a sense of hope and renewal as she faces future challenges.
1575	10443	4	3	"The author ends the story like that to show the theme working hard. Some other examples of working hard are the ""winter hibiscus."" Another example is her vow to pass the test, so that is why the author ends the story that way, reinforcing the idea that perseverance leads to success."
1576	10444	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph that they did because it's about the same thing that they opened the story with. To introduce the story, the author tells about Saeng failing her driver's test, and then seeing a familiar plant that she wants to buy. The middle of the story is about how she is having a hard time adapting to her new home. So to conclude the story, the author writes that Saeng will take her driver's test again, once the flowers start budding, and the geese come out. The flower and the geese remind her of home, so this tells you that thinking of her home, and the objects that make her feel at home, comfort her, and help her overcome obstacles. The familiar sights give her the courage and motivation she needs.
1577	10445	4	3	Authors use many techniques to improve their stories. Without these techniques a story would seem bland, average, or unattractive. Author Minfong Ho conveys the fact that Saeng will try to take the test again. Instead of simply stating the fact that she will retake the test, she has her make a promise on the geese that she will. The author ended the story like this, showing how strongly she felt about the test and emphasizing her determination.
1578	10446	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it connects the hibiscus back to the trials and triumphs of Saeng. Just how Saeng can’t give up and must go back to retake the test, the winter hibiscus must make it through the hard, rough winter and come back strong. The hibiscus are a symbol of hope and Saeng thinks of them as her hope, especially when she feels discouraged. Throughout the story, the hibiscus are comforting to Saeng because they remind her of home and the resilience she learned there. The author includes this because many people can relate to this and find hope in things, whether it’s a flower or a familiar song. For Saeng, knowing that each year the hibiscus will come back even in those harsh conditions, reassures her that she’ll be okay there as well, and gives her the strength to persevere through her own challenges.
1579	10447	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning. The geese are coming back, signaling a return and restart to their life there, the hibiscus will be blooming, representing resilience and beauty, and she will re-take the test. At the beginning Saeng was depressed about having to leave her old country and grandmother. Saeng began to feel “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” She remembered how some of these plants grew wild in bushes or between cracks in the sidewalk. Saeng saying what she did in the last paragraph is her showing that she found comfort and confidence in the hibiscus. Memories of the past showed her the way, providing strength, and now she is going to retake her driver's test, embodying a renewed sense of hope and determination.
1580	10448	4	3	I think the author concludes this story with this ending paragraph because the story is all about how she feels comforted in the plants, finding solace in their growth and stability amidst her own anxieties. She wants to wait until the weather breaks and the geese come back, suggesting a desire for a fresh start and a sense of natural order to align with her own internal state before facing the test. I think she wants to wait that way so she will be more comfortable with her surroundings, drawing strength from the renewed environment, and she can clear her mind, feeling more at peace and therefore able to do her best on the test.
1581	10449	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng wants to take the test again, but she wants to take the test again when everything else good and happy returns like the plant and the geese. This is true because Saeng says ""When they (geese) come back… and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This shows her maturity and desire for happiness. She wants to do something hard and maybe even not fun when everything else returns and is happy. Just as when she came, she was sad, but when the geese and plant come back she wants to share in that joy and perhaps subtly help them through this renewal. This way they all can be happy at the same time, representing a hopeful cycle of return and resilience."
1582	10450	4	3	The short story “Winter Hibiscus” as written by author Minfong Ho, ends with main character Saeng, promising herself that in the spring when the geese return and the winter hibiscus begins to bud, that she would re-take her failed drivers test. Minfong Ho writes this story with heavy imagery and symbolism; the hibiscus found in the floral shop represents a connection for Saeng to her homeland, and the bittermelon, which is loved by Saeng, but unbearable to people in @LOCATION1, represents Saeng’s hard time connecting to people in @LOCATION1. And for Saeng, the budding hibiscus and returning geese are representative of a new opportunity to pass her drivers test and better adapt to life in @LOCATION1, suggesting a hopeful outlook for her future integration.
1583	10451	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wanted to show that Saeng doesn’t give up and that nature gives Saeng strength. The conclusion shows that Saeng doesn’t give up by saying that she is going to take the test again, even though she failed it earlier that day, demonstrating her resilience. Also, it shows that nature gives Saeng strength by saying that Saeng will take the test again when the geese return, when hibiscus buds bloom, and when the snow melts in spring. Nature gives her strength because these natural events remind her of where they used to live and her grandmother's stories connected to these seasonal changes. In conclusion, the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng is not a quitter, and that nature gives her strength and confidence to persevere.
1584	10452	4	3	The character, Saeng, experiences both internal and external conflicts. Saeng had failed her driver’s test and still missed Vietnam. The ending of the story was an excellent choice of conclusion for the story. The flock of Canada geese represented her changes. She used to feel awkward and out of place. Many things were new to her. Saeng realized that life isn't so bad for her, and that she could adapt. The planting of the “winter hibiscus” represented her change as well. It showed how she will start anew and continue happily. Saeng will “plant a new seed.” The ending was well chosen for the story because it foreshadows Saeng’s future, hinting at growth and new beginnings. The story is inspiring and the ending greatly contributes to the effect, leaving the reader with a sense of hope for Saeng's journey.
1585	10453	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng relates the hibiscus overcoming of problems to her own overcoming of problems. Saeng is comparing the hibiscus to herself. If the hibiscus can adapt to its surroundings, then so can she, finding strength in resilience. And if the hibiscus makes it through the winter, then she too can make it; and she will re-take the test that she failed before, demonstrating her own persistence. Also, before this she says that things that were once strange to her now seemed familiar, like the geese. She then sees them overhead flying in a V, a symbol of unity and purpose. They are also adapting to their surroundings by flying to a warmer place, and Saeng too can adapt, drawing inspiration from their journey to face her challenges head-on.
1586	10454	4	3	The author concludes the story with that sentence because she is excited for spring to come back so she can plant more things and watch them bloom, and come alive, filling the garden with color and fragrance once again.
1587	10455	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because it shows Saeng will not give up. Saeng failed her driver's test, and as she was walking home, dejected, she found a hibiscus. It reminded her of her old home, a place filled with warmth and familiarity. Seeking to recapture that feeling, Saeng goes to the greenhouse or flower shop and buys one. When she returns home, she carefully plants the hibiscus in her garden. The hibiscus, a symbol of her past and a promise of future blooms, is keeping her from giving up on her dreams. When it starts budding, a sign of new life and growth, Saeng will take the test again, renewed with hope and determination.
1588	10456	4	3	"The author chose that paragraph to put at the end because that is when everything will be perfect to redo her mistake. Saeng said crying ""I-I failed the test!"" @CAPS1 means she failed at what she thought she was good at. ìHere let me help mother"" getting up and taking the shovel away from her mother. Saeng is trying to get better at gardening so when she does redo her mistake she will do better, showcasing her determination to improve. As the reader can see Saeng wants to pass the test, so she can believe she is a great gardener like her mother, demonstrating her desire for validation and mirroring her mother's skill."
1589	10457	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes people want to read the next story to see how she performs on the test. In the story, she initially failed the test; now that she has changed, she wants to retake it because she believes she can do better now than before, leaving the reader curious about her future success.
1590	10458	4	3	Cause everything that is in this paragraph is in the story somewhere, so it really intertwines together. She learns to adapt to her new homeland, finding ways to navigate the customs and environment, as does the plant, adjusting to the soil and climate.
1591	10459	4	3	I would say that the author concluded this story entirely paragraph because they wanted to be very consistent. They wanted the reader to have a very good example and understanding of the text, solidifying the themes and ensuring the message resonated clearly. In brief words, the ending served as a deliberate and concise reinforcement of the story's core elements.
1592	10460	4	3	The reason why they include the story with the paragraph is because they talk about the same thing. Then the inclusion of the story with the paragraph might have been to show the good relationship between the mother and daughter and how they can do things together. This shared experience strengthens their bond. Then in the story they talk about going to Canada together, further illustrating their close connection and shared adventures. Ultimately, the story enriches the paragraph by providing a concrete example of their relationship.
1593	10461	4	3	The author decides to conclude the story with this paragraph to show the strength and confidence Saeng has. By saying she would try to pass the test again in the spring is showing she is confident and is looking for a new beginning to come then, suggesting a renewed sense of hope. Also he concludes it this way because after she failed the test she didn’t have much self-confidence, feeling discouraged by the setback. And once she spoke to her mother and knew she was understanding, offering support rather than judgment, Saeng knew she had to try again and persevere until she passed the test, demonstrating her resilience and determination to achieve her goal.
1594	10462	4	3	I think when she takes the test over, it is going to be in the spring, and she is going to try and pass it. But she did not want to cry in front of her mother. I think she is going to make it up to her and pass the test, showing her resilience and determination to succeed.
1595	10463	4	3	The author concludes this story with that paragraph to show the readers she was knocked down by the test but she is going to get back up again and take the test again. This is also a very good way to end the story because it shows she is very determined to pass that test and won’t give up and will do anything to pass it, highlighting her resilience and unwavering commitment to achieving her goal.
1596	10464	4	3	The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because he is showing that she will not give up and she will do it when she is ready to. The reason I say this is because she is doing the test when she wants to, when she feels comfortable. It highlights her agency and determination to face her challenges on her own terms. Those are the reasons I believe that the author ended the story with that paragraph, emphasizing her resilient spirit.
1597	10465	4	3	"I believe the author concludes the story like this to show an example of perseverance. Saeng states, ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This statement represents adjusting to change. The seasons' cyclical nature mirrors her own journey of adaptation. Soon she will adjust fully to her new home, it just takes time. If she keeps persevering, she will make it. In the last paragraph Saeng says, ""when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Just as the seasons bring things back, she will come back. This cyclical return highlights her resilience. I believe this last paragraph was put in to show everyone should persevere because things just take time, and with continued effort, goals can be achieved."
1598	10466	4	3	"This statement shows what the author concludes about the story. It shows the theme of the story really. If you fail, then try again. This is what the statement is saying; she failed her tasks, so in the spring, once the hibiscus blooms again, she will attempt to complete her task. The statement also concludes how you should never give up. Saeng had failed the test. She said, ""I-I failed the test."" This shows how sad and depressed she was because the tone the statement was said in was a sadder, more depressed tone. Even though sad and depressed, Saeng knows that next year she will attempt to complete the test, showing her resilience. Overall, the sentence shows what the author concludes and thinks about the story ""Winter Hibiscus."""
1599	10467	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,î for several reasons. Saeng decides that she is determined to pass her driving test just like the hibiscus, which her mother says is ìstrong enough to make it through,î and Saeng decides to be strong like the hibiscus and make it through and pass the test. Next, the reason the geese are mentioned in the final paragraph is to tie in the fact that she is getting used to her new surroundings because the geese ìsound familiar.î As much as she misses her old home, she is adapting to her new environment. Finally, one can conclude that because she mentions the plant, which symbolizes her homeland, and the geese, which symbolizes her new home, that as much as she misses her old home, sheís starting to get used to her new country and she recognizes that she is part of it, indicating a sense of belonging and integration. She knows that letting her past get in the way of her will not help her pass the test and, like the plant and the geese, she will return again, demonstrating resilience and a commitment to overcoming challenges in her new life.
1600	10468	4	3	The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is trying to tell the reader a message. The author is trying to say that if a plant can make it through the cold winter, then she can pass her driver's test. That is why I think the author included that paragraph, using the plant as a symbol of resilience and perseverance in the face of challenges.
1601	10469	4	3	I think the author ended the story like that because she enjoys seeing the geese return each spring, a symbol of the season she loves. She also wants to take the upcoming test and, hopefully, pass it. In the meantime, she is diligently studying, hopeful for a positive outcome.
1602	10470	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that Saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it and also gives her memory of where she used to live before she had moved to the @ORGANIZATION1, the orphanage. Saeng had seemed out of place; she did not know what to do, but the hibiscus flower now gives her a sense of belonging and perhaps even confidence, leading the author to believe it will be her lucky charm for the test.
1603	10471	4	3	The author is very creative. He concludes the story saying how the hibiscus is budding and that she will take the test again. She believes that she will do better when the snow is gone. The author ended the story with that because Saeng was very upset failing a test, but with the comfort of the hibiscus, she’ll be able to do better. He also concludes the story with that paragraph because the climax was when she failed her test, and somehow the author had to conclude what was going to happen to Saeng with the test; it offers a sense of hope and resilience, suggesting that failure is not final and that improvement is possible with time and perseverance.
1604	10472	4	3	He concludes the story like that because the test was the main thing that he was talking about. It had been the central focus of his narration, influencing his actions and anxieties. Therefore, ending with a reflection on the test provides a sense of closure, albeit perhaps abrupt, aligning the conclusion directly with the narrative's core concern.
1605	10473	4	3	"In the end of ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the narrator describes her desire to take and this time pass the driver's test she failed earlier in the day, she ""vowed silently to herself"" that she would succeed at something she had failed at in the past. This is an important concluding message, because it shows that the author will overcome obstacles in her future. Most of the story is about the sadness that the narrator experiences because of longing for her homeland, Saeng misses her grandmother and the plants of Vietnam, and she even buys a hibiscus plant to remind her of her homeland. She is also not enjoying America, because she has already experienced failure at her new home. However, the end of the story provides contrast to this, for Saeng vows to succeed in the future, demonstrating her resilience and determination to adapt and thrive despite the challenges of adjusting to a new culture."
1606	10474	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did because it shows how much the main character has grown. She has learned that if a delicate flower like the hibiscus can make it through rough times she can too, mirroring her own resilience. Nature’s fight for survival is like Saeng’s struggle in a new place. She discovers that you will adapt to your surroundings over time, finding strength and familiarity. Then after that time it will feel just like home. The adaption principle is shown throughout this story, demonstrated by nature or a child’s life—it’s there. Therefore the author would agree that the conclusion of the story illustrates the biological and physical growth of Saeng, highlighting her newfound sense of belonging and the comfort she derives from observing the natural world around her.
1607	10475	4	3	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng is new to America. She is missing home when she sees a hibiscus in a flower shop. After she takes the flower home and plants it in her backyard, she decides the next time she’ll take the drivers test is when the Hibiscus is budding in the spring. The author concludes the story this way because it relates Saeng to the flower. Saeng feels out of place in America because the hibiscus is a connection to her old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can make it through the cold winter, she can too. She will take her drivers test as a sign of surviving and overcoming obstacles. In this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time. Saeng will adapt to the differences of America, the hibiscus will bloom; and Saeng will pass her drivers test, signifying a new chapter in her life.
1608	10476	4	3	They ended it because the girl is not going to give up. She is going to keep trying at this test and won't stop at it either, dedicating herself fully to studying. And she will be a little brighter, understanding the concepts more clearly with each attempt. She will also pass this test eventually, her persistence paying off. And this way she won't disappoint her mother, who has high expectations. And she will be able to get this test off of her shoulders, relieving the immense pressure she has been under, finally free from this burden.
1609	10477	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph inorder to help the reader visualize a new beginning for the girl. A time to re-take the test and have the fresh new flowers to look upon, offering a sense of hope. To watch the geese return, a familiar sight bringing comfort. The geese are symbolic to her and the quest she had taken to her new home, representing her journey and resilience. The combination of the melting snow and the budding flowers lets the reader know of the bright fresh unclaimed future that is to come for the girl, full of potential. The author uses the paragraph at the end inorder to explain more of what is to come, to enhance illustrations and capture the attentive audience, leaving a lasting impression. It is used to show a spirit in the girl that allows us to see that she is like the flower; she is having trouble rooting/grasping on to the new lifestyle, but there is always going to be a fresh/new time to continue on, highlighting her potential for growth and adaptation.
1610	10478	4	3	I think the author puts that paragraph in the story because maybe it's a good luck thing or it's a tradition, so it's very important that it's in the story. Also, it could be trying to tell us something, like she only takes tests in the spring when the hibiscus starts budding, suggesting a connection between her academic performance and the blooming of the flower, perhaps indicating a sense of hope or renewal associated with springtime. Therefore, the inclusion of the paragraph is likely significant, either due to cultural beliefs or as a symbolic element tied to the character's experiences.
1611	10479	4	3	"In the short story ìWinter Hibiscusî by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with that special paragraph in order to mutually assuage Saengís yearning for home but also to show that she is learning to overcome obstacles. Saeng wishes that she were in her homeland and keeps referring to it because she wants it back. ìI mean, itís not like the one we had at-at-,î Saeng continues to stumble because she doesnít wish to mention home, as it brings her to tears. In addition, when she mentions the ìtestî, it alludes to her buying a fake test. ìItís - itís not a real oneî. She refuses to buy a real one because it reminds her of the driving test and how sad she already is, as she tries to avoid anything that reminds her of her loss. The test refers to both the plant and the driverís test, representing challenges in her new life. Saeng also ends with this vow because the flower represents hope to her: ""... and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that testî. The emotional tests of both of the situations she is in will allow her to be stronger. This vow at the end of the story shows her willingness to be strong and come through in the end, demonstrating her resilience in the face of adversity."
1612	10480	4	3	...In the story the author concludes that after she's done her test and there's nothing left to see in the results, no immediate answers jumping out from the data, she'll grow more. It's in that quiet space, absent of external validation or obvious direction, that the real internal work begins, fostering resilience and self-reliance. This period of reflection, following the active pursuit of understanding, will ultimately be the most fertile ground for her development.
1613	10481	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because the girl did not pass the driving test. And she adds all of those details of nature in there because she takes time to care about nature. That is what it is mainly about in the story, revealing her perspective and connection to the world around her.
1614	10482	4	3	I am guessing the author adds this paragraph to tell the reader that when all of the beauty returns, she will try to get used to new things again, embracing the inevitable changes that come with the shifting seasons and a renewed appreciation for the world around her. This acceptance suggests a willingness to adapt and find comfort in the evolving landscape, recognizing that even in the face of constant transformation, there is a certain beauty to be found in the process of rediscovering and adjusting to new realities. Ultimately, she will strive to find peace and contentment amidst the ever-changing tapestry of life.
1615	10483	4	3	The author of Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of starting over and a new beginning for Saeng. The hibiscus, which survives the harsh winter, is a reminder of her home country and it keeps her going and strong, a symbol of resilience. She compares herself to the geese saying that things she thought were strange became familiar through a quiet repetition from season to season. In the winter the hibiscus doesn’t bloom and Saeng fails her driver’s test, experiencing a setback. That paragraph tells that in the spring when the Hibiscus thrives again and the geese return, bringing renewed energy to the landscape, it will be a fresh start for them and Saeng as well, offering hope for a brighter future.
1616	10484	4	3	The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to show Saeng’s determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test her mother knew that it was hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn’t a good idea. Saeng is kind of comparing herself to the plant. She might have thought, if this plant can make it through the winter and still keep growing, than she can make it through the test. Showing Saeng resolve through her desire to retake the test highlights her resilience and unwavering spirit; therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did.
1617	10485	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she has new hope and determination. The author loves and admires the hibiscus; for example, ìBut itís strong enough to make it through winterî, says her mother, highlighting its resilience. Saeng wants to be able to deal with hardships just as strongly as the hibiscus can. Seeing its ability to endure gives her strength. She is filled with new resolution when she says to herself ìThen i will take the test again,î showing she will persevere despite setbacks.
1618	10486	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the whole story was leading to it, building suspense and character development to reach this point. Without this conclusion, the story would have been pointless, leaving the reader without resolution or understanding of the central themes that were explored.
1619	10487	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is going to adapt to the conditions of her new life. The hibiscus is a plant that thrives in warm, tropical climates, much like Vietnam, Saeng’s home. However it does not survive in the cold; only the winter hibiscus, which can survive in both climates, can. The hibiscus symbolizes Saeng. She lived in Vietnam and loved it with all the pretty flowers and being with her grandmother. However now that she is living in the United States, with its colder climate and different culture, she is finding it hard to adapt. Now that she has this winter hibiscus flower, which adapts to the cold weather magnificently, she can adjust to her new life in the United States, embracing the change just as the flower does. When she sees the geese come back for another spring and summer, a sign of warmer weather and new beginnings, she will take the driving test because they are giving her area another chance of being their home for the season. This is why the author ends the story with this paragraph, highlighting Saeng's newfound hope and determination to thrive in her new environment.
1620	10488	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is about how the snow melts and the greenery returns, like a rebirth. This mirrors his renewed motivation to take the test again. This really shows how close he is to nature and the effect that his exposure to it has had on him over the years, shaping his perspective and resilience and ultimately inspiring him to persevere.
1621	10489	4	3	"I think that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because this whole story was sweet and left a beautiful picture in your head with about every sentence. So why not end it in a paragraph like, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Now tell that isn't beautiful. It’s a fitting ending that encapsulates the story’s themes of hope and resilience, leaving the reader with a feeling of optimism for Saeng's future."
1622	10490	4	3	The author put the last sentence the way it did. It meant that next spring they want to observe their differing responses to the familiar environment. Having experienced it before, they now possess a prior understanding, yet their reactions to the season's arrival will be the focus of observation, allowing a comparison of learned experience with fresh, individual responses.
1623	10491	4	3	He uses this line at the end of the story cause it shows she has another chance to pass the test. They use the plant cause a plant will always come back and bud again. This was also a good way to end the story because it shows now in the present plants @MONTH1 be a sign of inspiration and would teach you to look up to something. And maybe this is how she communicates with her mother through the plants, highlighting the enduring cycle of life and the potential for renewal, offering a hopeful conclusion to her journey.
1624	10492	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the ending paragraph suggests a growing acclimation to a new country. It implies she's adapting and becoming accustomed to her surroundings. Furthermore, it seems to convey a message about embracing change, suggesting one needs to adapt to new, unfamiliar winds. That’s why the story concludes with that paragraph, as it encapsulates her journey of adjusting and accepting the challenges of a new environment."
1625	10493	4	3	The flowers on this bush are very comforting to Saeng. In the story she explains that they remind her of her home in Vietnam. The budding of plant and spring represent new life. Saeng thinks that spring could also have a new beginning for her, a chance to shed the weight of past failures. That in spring, she will do better and pass the test. But, if she falls again, the flowers will have bloomed to comfort her, offering a silent promise of resilience and the cyclical nature of hope, a reminder that even after winter, spring always returns.
1626	10494	4	3	The author concludes with that because she kind of relates herself to the flowers. She has grown to her environment, putting down roots as it were, just like a flower adapts and thrives. Also she had failed her test, so just like when a flower dies in the winter and then comes back to life in the spring, she is going to come back and try the test again, demonstrating resilience and hope for future success.
1627	10495	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she failed the taste test, so over the winter they don’t get hibiscus. But over the spring, when they get hibiscus again, she will try to take the taste test again so she can pass it and perhaps finally identify the distinct flavor she's been seeking.
1628	10496	4	3	The author concludes this as the last paragraph for two main reasons. One is that the flower is almost like her in its being; the flower hasn't bloomed yet. But when the snow melts and the flower blooms, she sees herself in it and is inspired to try again, to bloom in passing the test. Another reason is because it reminds her of back home, and her mother understands why she paid so much for it, so they want to take care of it, creating a sense of shared connection and purpose, making it a fitting and hopeful ending.
1629	10497	4	3	Minfong Ho, the author of “Winter Hibiscus” concluded the story with Saeng vowing to herself that she will retake and pass her drivers test in the spring when the geese fly back and plant rebuds. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to signify Saeng’s willingness to start over. After failing a test, Saeng visits a green house and misses her old home, Vietnam. She buys a hibiscus and plants it when she comes home after noting the geese flying south for the Winter. The plant signifies her memories. When she first sees it, it’s blossomed. In the spring it will rebud and form another blossom while growing bigger. This parallels Saeng getting over her sadness and homesickness and rebuilding better memories while growing stronger. When she gets the chance, she intends to take it. The birds flying overhead are headed south for the winter for shelter from the cold. In spring they will return to start over, raise goslings, rebuild their home, and begin anew. Saeng is planning to start over, and pass it so she can drive and feel more accepted in @LOCATION2. Minfong Ho chose to end the story with a paragraph to signify the character’s starting over and rebuilding good memories, highlighting her resilience and hope for a brighter future.
1630	10498	4	3	"The last paragraph in ""Winter Hibiscus"" was added because the author wants to show that she feels bad because she did not pass the test. She feels disappointed because her mom is disappointed in her and knows she can pass it. While she stares at the hibiscus and then the geese flying in the air, she thinks that she does have a chance in passing the test, which is why she reflects on nature. Now that she is determined to take the test, she is going to take it at the same time next year and she believes she is going to pass it, showing her renewed hope and resolve."
1631	10499	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He concludes with this paragraph because that's how the girl feels. She feels that in the spring she can do better than what she did, implying a sense of hope and renewal after a period of difficulty, leaving the reader with a feeling that she is optimistic about the future.
1632	10500	4	3	It means that she wants to do it all over again. It's the girl's comfort zone, so that is what she does when she's upset. That is what the story and the phrase mean, suggesting a cyclical pattern of behavior rooted in a need for familiarity and control during times of emotional distress.
1633	10501	4	3	"The author concluded ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" to tell the reader never give up and to keep trying. It also tells us that family is always there because you can't do it on your own. ""It's a beautiful plant, this dok faeng- noi"", she finally said, feeling a surge of resolve, knowing that with the support of her family and her own perseverance, she could face any challenge and that the hibiscus, a symbol of resilience, would bloom again, just as her hopes would."
1634	10502	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author is trying to show the reader that she realized she cares about the nature and loves it so because she is waiting for the spring and as soon as the spring comes she will take the test again. So, in my opinion, the author wants to show the readers that the character in the story cares a lot about the nature's beauty, and her desire to retake the test emphasizes her newfound appreciation and connection with the natural world.
1635	10503	4	3	The author concludes the story with the sentence saying “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” because the hibiscus is not just a good luck charm; when it’s not there, things aren’t right, but its return signals better times. Also, the author concludes this way because the hibiscus gave her more confidence, and speaking confidently can lead to success. Ultimately, this lets the reader know that she believes in something that gives her hope, and that belief will serve her well.
1636	10504	4	3	"The author concludes the story that way because one theme is to overcome obstacles. The hibiscus, despite facing a challenging environment, represents Saeng's perseverance, and the last paragraph offers closure to the conflict that was introduced regarding her upcoming test. The hibiscus is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here… that is what matters,"" this makes a connection between the plant and the author's perseverance because of the plant's symbolism of resilience. The last paragraph reinforces that symbolism with closure because she says she'll wait until spring to take the test again, mirroring the hibiscus's dormancy and eventual rebirth, ultimately highlighting her enduring hope."
1637	10505	4	3	Saeng is trying to say that when the time comes again that she will take the test. The author concludes the story with this because it leaves you wondering about what will happen the next time she takes the test. The author also does this to show that you should never quit; like if the flower can survive winter, then she will be able to survive that test. Also, the author is saying that when the seasons change, things change, suggesting that fortunes can also shift. She was going to give up because she failed the test, but she saw that plant surviving through the harsh weathers, and that gave her more confidence. Also, she cherished the plant because she wants to see it budding, as her and her mother spent quality time due to this plant she had, solidifying her resolve to persevere.
1638	10506	4	3	Saeng is talking about her school work and the garden. She always connects the two of them in the same way. She knows that she has to study while the garden grows, and she wants to water the flowers, but textbooks demand her attention too. She is saying that when the spring comes, a time of vibrant growth in the garden, she won't be there as much for it because she will have to take the test, focusing all her energy on academics, a sacrifice she accepts as part of her responsibilities.
1639	10507	4	3	The author ended the story that way to show that Saeng won’t give up and is determined to complete her task, passing her upcoming test. The author wants the reader to understand Saeng is very sad and wants to overcome being homesick, finding strength within herself. Saeng is very much like the hibiscus plant, she’s frail and beautiful, yet resilient. Saeng says she will do her test again when the hibiscus is budding, almost like she’s growing along with the plant, symbolizing her own personal growth and adaptation to her new environment. This connection to the hibiscus underscores her hope and perseverance.
1640	10508	4	3	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that everything and everyone can make it through a tough time. This paragraph acts as a final positive message to readers. The text say, ìwhen they come back... I will take that test againî. This quote shows that Saeng can see herself as one of the geese or the budding hibiscus plants, drawing parallels to their resilience. She knows that her ìwinterî is her test and that when she is ready, sheíll be able to take the test again and be successful. The budding of the hibiscus represents the time when sheíll be prepared to take the test, symbolizing hope and future success. Though she is having a tough time now, she'll be able to get through it and make another attempt. This paragraph is at the end because it brings together the purpose of the hibiscus, solidifying its symbolic meaning. Without saying this, the readers would have never gotten this message; instead, they would believe that the role of the hibiscus was to serve as a connection to Saengís past. In conclusion, this positive paragraph was included to show readers that everyone can bounce back from a bad situation, offering a message of hope and perseverance.
1641	10509	4	3	One, it could mean she can only take the test in the spring. But also, because her surroundings during that period relaxed her. When she was disappointed and upset about her driving failing grade, the spring weather and blooming flowers seemed to ease her anxiety, creating a calmer mental state conducive to better performance. Taking the test again in a similar environment might help her succeed, as she associates that time with a sense of ease and reduced pressure.
1642	10510	4	3	@CAPS1 OPTIMISTICALLY concludes the story with this because she really cared for the hibiscus. She said this because she was comparing her test to the hibiscus. When the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. Hibiscus is everything for her; it is her good luck. And with hibiscus budding, she can make her new life. Without the hibiscus plant, she was like “I failed the test” and “I bought it,” Sang answered, reading her mother’s next question. She was so depressed with her test failing that's why she bought the hibiscus to influence her life. She decided when it will spring with hibiscus budding, she will start her new life by giving the test again and proving to herself how important the hibiscus is to her renewed hope.
1643	10511	4	3	The author is concluding that anything can happen in the story. Saeng planted a winter hibiscus and her mother was getting mad at her. Saeng’s mother was mad because she spent money on the whole plant instead of planting it and then it would be a lot cheaper. When her mother was mad and in disbelief, Saeng started crying and the mother forgave her for her actions. This shows that anything can happen, because the mother’s anger, a seemingly strong emotion fueled by financial concerns, dissolved so quickly into forgiveness upon seeing Saeng's tears, demonstrating the unpredictable nature of human emotions and reactions within the narrative.
1644	10512	4	3	The author most likely concludes the story with that paragraph because they are trying to show the reader that even though you fail at something, you can't be stubborn. So Saeng failed her driver's test, but in the spring, when the hibiscus plant starts to bud, she will go back and take the test again, showing her resilience. By the plant budding, she thinks of that as a sign that she will pass the test, indicating her optimism and determination to try again despite the setback.
1645	10513	4	3	The Author concludes the story with Saeng saying a vow silently to herself to show the reader that she will grow like the hibiscus plant and take the test again, this time determined to pass it. The plant gives Saeng hope because it reminds her of the homeland that she loved so much and the vibrant life she left behind. When the hibiscus starts budding and gaining beautiful flowers, a symbol of resilience and beauty, Saeng will ìbudî too and gain her license, finally achieving her professional goals in this new land.
1646	10514	4	3	I think that the passage is trying to say the sun because in the passage it says ìin the spring when the snows melt and only the sun does that and the gees return hunting season and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test againî. So, spring is the key, and the passage directly associates the melting snow and the return of geese to the sun's influence during springtime. Therefore, the sun seems to be the focal point.
1647	10515	4	3	"The author used the paragraph telling about how Saeng would test in the spring at the end of the story because the words used and the way it is read can tell the reader that Saeng is at peace and accepts the fact that she lives in the U.S. When Saeng says, ""and this hibiscus plant is budding,"" she is thinking about how the plant reminds her of her native country and provides a tangible link to her past. Also, when she says, ""Then I will take this test again,"" she is promising herself that she will take the test when she feels more settled and at home in her new country. Saeng, in a way, is telling herself that she should accept her move and that she can still be reminded of her native country with the new hibiscus plant and other connections she makes. This acceptance shows that she is ready to embrace her new life while cherishing her roots."
1648	10517	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph for a very good reason. The author could write a sequel to this one. She could want the people to keep coming back for more, or wants people to know when things start up again so will Saeng. Ending the story with that paragraph is a very good thing to do. The author wants you to know when the plant and geese restarts their lives Saeng will do the same. She will not give up but instead re-take the test, strengthened by her experiences. The author could be planning to write a sequel to this short story. It leaves you thinking so then the sequel will be about the start of Saeng’s new life and what she plans to do to keep her vow. When everything starts to come alive in the spring so will Saeng. The author @MONTH1 love having people wonder about whats coming next. The people will go home and wonder what will the author do next with Saeng. The author loves keeping people in suspense and waiting for an answer, strategically planting the seeds of anticipation for what Saeng's future holds.
1649	10518	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the willingness of Saeng to overcome the obstacles and adapt to her new life. The hibiscus discussed in the ending quote describes Saeng’s new hope and determination to succeed in the United States. For example in the text it states, “Ö its fine petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.” When Saeng had found a plant that seemed to tie together her past in Vietnam and her future in @LOCATION3, she was overwhelmed. The hibiscus represents new hope in a seemingly impossible situation. When the hibiscus has blossomed, her world will be open and a new life will be waiting to begin. With this thought realized at the end of the story, the reader understands that Saeng has found new stability and will eventually succeed. In addition, in the text it says, “it felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center just as she had known it would feel.” Saeng’s past memories could be reached when this hibiscus was new, and that served as immense inspiration to her. The author ended the story with Saeng’s new recollection and hope to prove that she had indeed found something helpful and stable in a new world, ultimately showcasing her resilient spirit.
1650	10519	4	3	The author concluded the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with the paragraph she chose because she wanted to portray to her reader that even though Saeng was experiencing a hardship leaving her old home behind, she could still find a good life with new beginnings here. In the final paragraph the winter snow represents hard times in the past, while the spring represents a more optimistic future, and a new beginning. Although Saeng was grieving at the loss of her past, she could still find happiness here. In the story she once knew hibiscus near her old home. She finds hibiscus where she is now and it is a semblance and reminder of her old home. Also, the story says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This quote leads into the final paragraph and shows her acceptance that she can appreciate and happily live in this new home. The final paragraph says, “…when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” When things familiar to her and things that remind her of her old home come back, Saeng will have the strength to try to accomplish good things for this new life in a new home again, demonstrating her resilience and hope for a positive future.
1651	10520	4	3	The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows that you can always start clean and you should never give up when you really want something. Danita really wanted to pass the test, so she worked hard, but she failed it. She knows, like the plant in spring, life will offer a new beginning, and you can always change something you don't like about yourself. I strongly agree with this statement because if you didn't have a second chance, most people would all be losers because everyone makes mistakes in their life, and everyone has the opportunity to fix them. This is why I believe the author concludes with this statement at the end of the story, emphasizing the cyclical nature of life and the constant possibility of renewal.
1652	10521	4	3	The story ends with that paragraph because Saeng believes next spring, when her new hibiscus blooms, she will have good luck to pass her driving test. It is a good way to end the story because the hibiscus was not a significant part of her life before she failed the driving test. Now she believes that on her next driving test, she will have a tangible connection to her past experiences, a symbol of her ability to overcome obstacles, and a source of comfort in a time of disappointment, all of which Saeng thinks can help her pass the test. Thus, the hibiscus represents hope renewed and a positive outlook for the future.
1653	10522	4	3	The author could have had many reasons to conclude the story with this paragraph. One reason might be to explain how she has changed in the story. Toward the beginning of the story the author sounds discouraged and upset that she failed her test. In her final paragraph it shows she overcame her fear. Also, the geese move like she did. Saeng and her family have moved to the United States, but the geese feel odd moving too but they come back every year. Along with the flower, Saeng is unique in her new life and must learn to adapt as the geese and flower do. She knows that the flower will bud and the geese will return in the spring and that is what she must do. She won’t give up but try again later on in the year, displaying resilience. This shows how she is adapting and changing to work with her new surroundings, embracing a hopeful outlook.
1654	10523	4	3	"In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng’s determination to not only pass her driving test, but to accommodate to her new home. The author uses ""vowed"" to express positive connotation in the paragraph. The author says, “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… familiar.” The author says this to show that she is adapting to her new lifestyle, yet he uses the last paragraph to say that she needs a little more time to fully adjust and feel completely at home in her new environment, indicating that while progress has been made, the journey of assimilation is ongoing."
1655	10524	4	3	In the story, Winter Hibiscus, Saeng made a promise to herself that she would never fail the test again, a test that symbolized her integration into a new culture. Saeng wanted to remember her past and homeland, the vibrant colors and traditions she left behind. That is why she bought the flowers, the winter hibiscus, as a tangible reminder of her Korean heritage. At the end of the story, filled with a renewed sense of determination, she vows, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” She says this because she wants to move on now and try to get used to her new home, embracing the future while still honoring her roots, showing her resilience and hope for a balanced life.
1656	10525	4	3	The author had the story end with that paragraph because all the ideas are brought together and to show that Saeng is ready for what's ahead. When they put in the flower, they are concluding the flower's importance and how it relates to how the girl feels, being happy or sad, solidifying its symbolic weight within the narrative. Yet, when she says that she vowed and that she'd take the test again, she is saying that she is ready for what's ahead but will be open-minded to what's new so that she can see where she's grown from, highlighting her personal evolution. Therefore, the author ends with that paragraph to leave mystery for what happened and to conclude the story on a note of hopeful anticipation and reflective growth.
1657	10526	4	3	The author concludes the story with this because it's winter now and the flowers are gone, but during that time when she was planting, she grew more mature. Like it says in the text, things she used to think were strange are now becoming familiar, and she's getting the hang of things, understanding the nuances of the soil and the specific needs of each seed. Because she's learning more about it and gaining practical experience, she'll be ready for the test next spring, equipped with both knowledge and the wisdom gained from nurturing life.
1658	10527	4	3	The author uses this as an ending paragraph in the story because, next year at the same time, she will face the test of life over again, another opportunity to learn and perhaps make different choices, knowing that growth comes from continuous engagement with its challenges.
1659	10528	4	3	"The ending of a story helps determine the meaning of the story. It is the final closure and will most likely be remembered by the reader. In the end of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" the author ends it with a paragraph of encouragement. The conclusion encourages you to keep trying, because it states that next year when the flower blooms Saeng will re-take the test. This shows encouragement because has the drive to try again and to pass. The author ends with the feeling of encouragement because it leaves the reader inspired. Her conclusion is strong and also seems to recap the story's meaning because all along Saeng keeps getting disappointed about the flower, her mother, and homeland encourage her to move on and try again. Ultimately, the ending used was meaningful and showed what the author was truly trying to convey about resilience and the importance of perseverance."
1660	10529	4	3	In the story ìWinter Hibiscusî by Minfong Ho, the main character is troubled because they moved away from home and the culture, customs and even food are different. Therefore, the main character has difficulty adapting to her new environment. Her struggles are evident as she misses her old life. The author concludes the ending statement to show that she will not stop trying to achieve her goal. She wants to take the test again to see if over time things have changed. The story is very emotional and expresses a great deal of sorrow that is overcome in the end, showing her resilience.
1661	10530	4	3	The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph about geese to show that Saeng is going to try to overcome her obstacles. She was deeply disappointed in failing the test so she took comfort in memories of her homeland. She bought a hibiscus that she saw in her homeland a lot, and that flower symbolized comfort and affection. But it also represented her ability to come over obstacles, and while she was planting her hibiscus, and saw the geese flying above, she knew she had to try again, drawing strength from their determined flight and the familiar comforts of home.
1662	10531	4	3	The author says this because she will try to start her own garden. Her other garden didn’t turn out too well. In the book it says she needed her mom’s help, and perhaps this time she wants to prove she can do it independently. She is determined to succeed on her own this time.
1663	10532	4	3	The author concludes the paragraph when Saeng realizes she can miss her old home, but she needs to adapt to the new place that she is in. Saeng misses the old memories of her homeland ìA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saengís eyes now swept over her.î But, she begins to realize that not everything has changed, same things are still familiar. ìoverhead, a flock of canada geese flew by, the faint honrs clears and ñyes- familiar to Saeng now.î This moment of recognition, of hearing something known, provides a bridge between her past and present. When Saeng realizes that not everything has changed she gained the strength to continue her new life in her new country.
1664	10533	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it was a good way to end the story off. At the end of this they was talkin about how Saeng would come back when the snow melts and then she will take the test again, offering a sense of hope and anticipation for her future.
1665	10534	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding; then I will take that test again. The author concludes this story Winter Hibiscus with this paragraph because the story is about Saeng and she fails her driver's test, and notices a familiar plant which causes her to go to a florist shop. As Saeng learns about this familiar plant it encourages her to retake that driver's test, when the snow is gone. The author concludes the story this way to show that Saeng still has hope to succeed and adapt in this new country, showing a shift from despair to hope, and demonstrating her determination to do well in her new home.
1666	10537	4	3	I think he put this in here because I think heís trying to say when the snow melts just forget bout the first time. And when the geese return it your @NUM1 chance. Then the hibiscus budding is you get passed what you were trying to do; he's using nature and its cycles to illustrate themes of renewal and opportunity, suggesting a chance for a fresh start and eventual success.
1667	10538	4	3	This author concludes the story with this paragraph, because they both were talking about the cold or the weather and the coming spring, so it stated when snows melt as it talks about weather or the coming spring.
1668	10539	4	3	The author concludes the story like this because it shows how the main character has been affected by the events or happenings in the story. In the beginning of the story we learn that the main character has failed her driver’s test. Also in the story she had spent a large amount of money just for one plant, in which her mother is shocked about. The reader at that point would expect for her to be very sad and depressed about these events. But because of her grandmother and the connection to her homeland that the plant represents, she instead surprises the reader by looking on the bright side of things and saying that when the flower blooms again she will take the test again. This shows the deep connection between the main character and the plant, essentially giving the plant a humanlike existence and mirroring her own resilience.
1669	10540	4	3	"I believe that the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to illustrate the overall message of the story. That paragraph sums up the message of determination and overcoming obstacles. Saeng is coming from another country and is facing challenges not only in the garden, but in her life as well. The hibiscus she's trying to cultivate mirrors this struggle. She had to learn how to adjust to her new surroundings and never give up on what she wanted to accomplish. So, by saying ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" she truly shows her determination and how she’s not afraid to overcome obstacles that will face her, highlighting her resilience in the face of adversity and solidifying the story’s central theme of perseverance."
1670	10541	4	3	The author concludes this story this way because instead of absorbing all the pain, she can look into the future. Also, by looking into the future, she can forget about the past and try better in the future, offering her a path toward healing and growth. This forward-looking perspective ultimately allows her to transcend the weight of her experiences and embrace the possibilities that lie ahead.
1671	10542	4	3	The author concludes the story with this piece because she said “a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear,” I think she means that even though the geese flew over with their heads up high, Saengís wasn’t. “Next year when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She means she will not have her head down and be grateful for her new home and it with time. When she looks at her hibiscus, she will have fond memories but not be sad, suggesting resilience and hope for the future.
1672	10543	4	3	There are two reasons why he had conclude the story with this paragraph. One reason the author had conclude the story with the paragraph because Saeng had silently picked up a Winter Hibiscus, hoping it would bring her luck so she could pass her driving test. The last reason the author had conclude the story with this paragraph is because she wants to try her driving test again, determined to pass so she can finally drive independently upon succeeding. These two reasons, though subtle, reveal the author's intention in concluding the story with that hopeful sentence.
1673	10544	4	3	I think that the reason why the author concludes this paragraph in the story is because he wanted to show the longing Saeng had for the geese. This longing underscores Saeng's emotional connection to nature and perhaps foreshadows his later actions, solidifying the author's intent.
1674	10545	4	3	"There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" in the way that she did. ""Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here…"" is what Saeng’s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, she's silently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond. Also in the story, the author states ""…she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become…almost familiar to her now."" Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, but she will eventually adjust to her new home and prevail. When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, it's obvious that subconsciously, she is saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time; time to adjust, time to learn, and time to grow stronger, just like the winter hibiscus. Ultimately, the ending suggests a hopeful future for Saeng, one where she finds her place and succeeds despite the challenges she faces."
1675	10546	4	3	In the story Winter Hibiscus, Saeng says that she will take the test again in the spring, so she can walk home and see the flower that she found. The winter hibiscus reminded her of similar blooms in her childhood country. But the next time she takes the driving test, she would like to pass. It shows that she was disappointed because, in the story, it says that she paid over nineteen dollars for the test. Her mother was astonished and yelled at her for a second, upset about the wasted money. Saeng began crying, and her mother calmed to show sympathy for her daughter's distress. Now, with renewed resolve, she has the determination to take the test again, driven by both the desire for a license and the symbolic pull of the winter hibiscus.
1676	10547	4	3	"Minfong Ho, the author of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" ended her story with Saeng thinking about the spring because she wanted to make Saeng's future more hopeful. The character Saeng seemed depressed and always reminiscient of her past in Vietnam. When she sees the Hibiscus and Jasmine flowers she ""brokedown and wept"", and she remembers her grandmother fixing her hair when she smells the Jasmine. To make matters worse for Saeng she failed her driving test, which is something that most teens find as a big disappointment. By this point in the story I felt sorry for Saeng and I wondered if things would get better for her because she was away from everything she knew and loved with just some memories and a winter hibiscus unlike the kind she had back at her name in Vietnam. Then, in the last line, Saeng suddenly becomes hopeful for her future and ""when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" suggesting a sense of renewal and anticipation for better times to come."
1677	10548	4	3	The concluding paragraph to the story “Winter Hibiscus” gives a sense of hope for the future. The girl, Saeng, has just failed her test and is feeling depressed. Through a series of events, her depression leaves her and she feels hope. “Then I will take that test again.” This final sentence shows Saeng’s determination. She was upset about leaving her home and she was upset about failing her test, but thanks to a flower, she got her confidence back. This flower, a winter hibiscus blooming unexpectedly, became a symbol of resilience. Whenever someone is upset it is easy to give up. Until the final paragraph, the tone in the story is depressing. When the author put in the conclusion, it was like a light at the end of a dark tunnel. The author is saying that even when things are hard and seem impossible, something will be there to lift your spirits. There is always a positive in a negative situation; you just have to look for it. Saeng’s renewed determination is a reminder that even after setbacks, hope and perseverance can bloom, just like the winter hibiscus, leading to future success.
1678	10549	4	3	In guessing that it means that when winter or spring or whatever it's harder to grow that garden. Also maybe it's a challenge of some sort to make the garden grow by that time of year. So I would assume that's what it's talking about with it, suggesting difficulties are presented by less favorable growing seasons and imply a task to overcome these seasonal hurdles.
1679	10550	4	3	The author includes that sentence at the end of the story because throughout the story it was showing courage, and that explains her getting better and showing courage that she is going to go back and try to pass that test, not letting it get her down that she failed the first time. This final act underscores her resilience, suggesting a positive trajectory fueled by bravery and determination.
1680	10551	4	3	To me I would have to say that the reason why the author concluded his story with this paragraph would be of different reasons. To explain it could mean new beginning or starting over. For example, when the geese fly away and came back, that means that the seasons are changing. So with that being said, the seasons changing or starting over could represent his chance to take the test again and start over, and he will get another chance, offering a sense of hope and renewal.
1681	10552	4	3	I think they think it will bring them luck, a charm perhaps, against the challenges they face daily.
1682	10553	4	3	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows you can overcome something if you have the willpower. Saeng failed the first test, a setback that could have discouraged her. She bought a plant that reminds her of home, a tangible link to her past. She planted the plant despite the cold, hard ground, symbolizing her resilience. She realized the once strange things were now part of her everyday life, demonstrating her adaptation. She decided to retake the test, showing her determination. Saeng realized that even though you might fail once, you have to keep trying if it is what you believe in. She also realized that she will never forget her home, but she still can move on and embrace her new life. Finally, Saeng realized that good things can overcome bad, and hope can blossom even after disappointment. After she failed the test, she bought the flower, a symbol of her renewed hope and commitment. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it summarizes the story perfectly, encapsulating Saeng's journey of resilience, adaptation, and unwavering spirit.
1683	10554	4	3	The author includes the excerpt at the end for a meaningful reason to Saeng. The hibiscus symbolizes everything: her home, her past, and her comfort, offering a tangible link to what she left behind. Saeng feels that if the flower can bloom, so can she, implying resilience and adaptation to change. This will enable her to get used to her new home and retake the test with renewed confidence. It also resembles hope, because if the plant can make it through the winter and bloom in the spring, symbolizing perseverance and rebirth, so can she. The author used this to connect the feelings of Saeng with the realistics of the flower's bloomability, grounding her emotional journey in the natural world and suggesting a path towards healing and growth.
1684	10555	4	3	The author concludes that statement because the geese move south in the winter and come back in the spring, Saeng has failed the test in the winter but she will retake it while the season of spring comes. As Saeng fails her driving test and she sees the familiar plant, it suggests a sense of belonging and determination, which means she will come back to take the test again. The geese have left but will come back when the season is coming. So both the geese and Saeng have a reason to come back north or retake the test. The author adds the statement in the end because the geese's cyclical actions, their departure and eventual return, mirror Saeng's situation and her implied resolve to try again; thus, the comparison emphasizes Saeng's resilience and hope.
1685	10556	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show how Saeng was not going to give up. Throughout the story she had been feeling down, from when she failed the test and she misses Vietnam. So many things throughout where she and her mother lives reminds her of Vietnam. ìShe closed her eyes and breathed. in, deeply Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmotherís long gray hair....î This made her very emotional, to see how many things reminded her of Vietnam. The author ended like this to show how the experience of all this affected her, but ultimately strengthened her resolve to persevere despite the challenges of adapting to a new life.
1686	10557	4	3	The author choses to end the story like this to inspire a sense of determination. Saeng got the plant to remind her of her homeland and cheer her up during a difficult time of studying for her upcoming test. Once the plant has bloomed, signifying growth and resilience, she feels like she would as well, strengthened and ready for the test, symbolizing her own potential to flourish despite challenges. This parallel between Saeng and the plant underscores a message of hope and the power of inner strength.
1687	10558	4	3	The author concluded the passage with a very powerful statement: “When the geese come back... in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” This statement shows renewal and persistence. I think she added this because after realizing the plant can come back time and time again, even after the harsh weather, she knew she could do it too. She vowed to herself that when the day comes again she will be ready to renew herself and get back on track. It conveys persistence also. The plant doesn’t die each season. It’s hardy and comes back. If the girl can be persistent and come back next year to retake the test, she will be considered persistent. I think the girl wants to be just like the flower. She sees it as being indomitable, renewing and beautiful, so she is motivated to emulate its resilience. No matter where the plant is being grown, it will always keep those traits, and the girl hopes to cultivate a similar unwavering spirit within herself.
1688	10559	4	3	The reason for the author concluding the following is because she wants it to be known to the readers that Saeng is not going to just give up because she fails it the first time. That she is going to achieve so that her mother can be proud of her and to show herself she is trying to make an effort. It states that Saeng will retake the test again in the spring when the snow has melted and geese return and the hibiscus is budding. Not only was the hibiscus an important part to the story, it was a very important part to her life; it helped her move on and see how things change because over time it will change and develop and adapt to the changes around it. Yes, it was a disappointment to her mother, but she sort of understood why she brought the plant home. It might have comforted her in a way. There were many different things probably going on where she was when she missed the test; it wasn’t home. She has to adjust and adapt to the situation that she is in, demonstrating a resilience that suggests future success and a deeper understanding of life's challenges.
1689	10560	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test and next time that time of year comes back around she will have another chance to pass the test. I say that because in the text it states that she paid over @MONEY1 for it all of the vegetable seeds in the garden didnít even cost that much, showing how much she valued this opportunity. That is why I say she concluded with that paragraph, emphasizing the cyclical nature of the test and Saeng's determination to try again.
1690	10561	4	3	Next year around the winter time when she should have to plant things again, she is going to be ready, having learned from past mistakes. This time she's going to do it much better, planning meticulously and researching the specific needs of the plants she chooses so that she can ensure a more successful yield.
1691	10562	4	3	"The author included this because she was showing that it was winter, and the flower was going to bloom, and the geese were flying here because it is cold. This sets the scene and provides context for the events to come. Also, the author said that because the story title is called the ""Winter Hibiscus,"" which obviously blooms in the winter, so that is why I think the author said what she did, emphasizing the central theme and foreshadowing the significance of the flower to the narrative. Therefore, the author's descriptions are crucial for understanding the setting and the story's namesake."
1692	10563	4	3	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with a sentence stating that when Saeng’s Hibiscus’ first bud appears in the spring she will be back to take her driver's test. The author might have decided to conclude the story like that because what if the plant died, would she go back and take the test? It leaves the reader pondering Saeng’s commitment and the symbolic connection between her personal growth and the plant's survival. The author was probably just wanting the reader to think hard about it, prompting reflection on themes of hope and perseverance. In conclusion, the author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” might have concluded his story to make it somewhat suspenseful, leaving the audience with a lingering question about Saeng's future.
1693	10564	4	3	The story ends with that line because @CAPS1 draws strength from the hibiscus, so next time she will not fail the test. In the time that it takes for the hibiscus to grow she will be growing also as a person and so will be ready for the test. The story says, ìPlants that she had even realized she had known but forgotten drew her back into her childhood worldî (Ho). Saeng had a good childhood where she got love and support. By seeing all of those plants again especially the hibiscus she can draw strength from the memories she has. The memories the hibiscus bring back are also very sad. The story says, ìA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saengís eyes now swept over her ì(Ho). Experiencing all of that sadness again will only make her stronger. Along with just the sight of the hibiscus other things will make her ready for the test also. The story says, ìIt felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet towards the center ñ just as she had known it would feelî (Ho).The feel of the hibiscus @MONTH1 remind Saeng of distant memories, like helping her grandmother with her hair, connecting her to her past. All of these things will only make Saeng stronger so that the next time she takes the test she will not fail, for she will be fortified by her history and the love she has known.
1694	10565	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring when the snow's gone she will take the test again, more determined than ever. The long winter months will offer ample time for focused study and practice, free from the distractions of the harsh weather and limited mobility. This time, she will approach the test with a renewed sense of confidence, fueled by her past experience and unwavering commitment to succeed, ensuring a different outcome.
1695	10566	4	3	In the quote above it is telling that Saeng is glad to be back. Saeng also states that she would be ready to do it again if she had to, demonstrating her resilience and commitment. This suggests a positive overall experience despite potential challenges.
1696	10567	4	3	"I think the author concluded the story like that is because it was cold outside. I also think that the author is trying to say is that when she wrote this letter it was cold outside and she wouldn’t take the test until it was warm again because of the cold. ""In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this is when the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test over again."" This suggests a strong aversion to the cold and a preference for taking the test under more favorable, warmer conditions, ultimately influencing the story's conclusion."
1697	10568	4	3	"The author says, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" because the girl left everything to come to this country and feels the immense pressure not to fail. The girl said, ""That at last, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? the hibiscus hedge?"" She said this also because the hedge was all she had from her old home besides her mother, and when the ""hibiscus is budding"" it signifies starting a new life and growing leaves, mirroring the girl's own journey of growth and moving on with her life in a new place. Therefore, the hibiscus serves as a tangible link to her past and a symbol of hope for her future success."
1698	10569	4	3	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because if the author tries it again, it might work out a lot better now they know what they are doing and have learned from their mistakes. Also, if they try it again and it makes enough, they can sell it and make money, so they will keep doing it for years to come, refining their technique and hopefully achieving greater success in the future.
1699	10570	4	3	The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî concludes the story with a resolution of Saeng in order to show how Saeng will not give up and how she is determined. The reference to the spring blossoms shows how Saeng will fight to survive through the hardships, which are represented by winter. Just like the hibiscus that struggles to adapt to a new home, Saeng is struggling to adapt to a new country, facing challenges with language and cultural differences. The final paragraph provides a resolution to the internal conflict of Saeng throughout the story by suggesting that Saeng will succeed in taking the test and embracing her new life. In conclusion, the final paragraph in the story ìWinter Hibiscusî provides a resolution to the conflict in the story, and shows the reader Saengís determination.
1700	10571	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows what Saeng will be doing and if she will go to school. Saeng didn't want to go to school because she would rather wait for the snow to melt and the geese to return, and this hibiscus is budding, and prefers gardening to school, and the garden reminds her of her homeland. For Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the winter hibiscus into it. The things that made her think about her homeland were the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan, the pungent smell of bitter melon wafting out. Another thing she did was go over to the corner of the vegetable patch and start to dig a hole in the ground; that shows she cares about the garden, solidifying her choice to connect with nature and her roots instead of attending school.
1701	10572	4	3	The author concludes her story with the quote, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” because the author is showing that nature and the plant are valuable to her. Saeng (who says the quote) believes that the hibiscus, tied to the cyclical return of spring, will bring her luck and renewed strength to pass the test. Earlier on in the story it shows that when she gets in trouble, she rubs the plant leaves in her hands to help her overcome the problem, finding solace and courage in its presence. The author is making the idea clear and portraying the idea that the plant helps Saeng with obstacles, acting as a tangible source of comfort and resilience for her.
1702	10573	4	3	In the end of the story the girl Saeng vowes to herself that she will take the drivers test next year. One reason she might have vowed to herself to do that is to prove that she can pass the test, overcoming her fear and self-doubt. Also, the flower after she bought it and planted it, and after she remembered all the good times she had in Vietnam, gave her the confidence to go out and get what she wanted. This newfound determination, spurred by both a desire for personal validation and a reconnection with her roots, solidifies her resolve to take the test and move forward.
1703	10574	4	3	"The author includes this in the paragraph to simply be sarcastic for you to know that it is almost impossible for Saeng to take the test afresh. I say this because she was being very sarcastic, meaning she’s not going to take the test. For example, if someone were to tell me to take a test and I said ""whenever @LOCATION1 is president again, then I’ll take the test,"" that would be very sarcastic, meaning that it won't happen and I’m not taking the test, instead of just saying no. The author included that just to let you know that the chances of her taking the test is very low, effectively conveying her unwillingness through indirect and humorous means."
1704	10575	4	3	The author includes this paragraph in order to show an end to the story and to show that Saeng has not given up. Ho wanted to show how the plant and the geese represented the continuation of Saeng's life in the United States. The geese will come back and the Hibiscus will bud and flower, and Saeng will retake and hopefully pass her diving test. This paragraph is not just a closing but a new beginning of life for geese, a Winter Hibiscus, and Saeng, illustrating resilience and the cyclical nature of hope and perseverance.
1705	10576	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng's strength and encouragement. When she’s willing and able she will take the test again with more confidence. Saeng says this to herself to help her get through until she can drive. She’s saying by next spring she’ll take her test. By next spring she’ll be able to drive. By next spring she’ll be used to her new home. This paragraph tells that it takes time to do things; you don’t always get it right away, so keep trying, and her resilience is what will ultimately help her succeed.
1706	10577	4	3	In my opinion the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was feeling down about not passing her driving test, a disappointment weighing heavily on her. But when she saw those flowers, a vibrant splash of color in the urban landscape, she realized when she came to @CAPS1 she forget all about her home town, the fields and natural beauty she left behind. So she decided to get back in touch with a nature side, reconnecting with a part of herself she had neglected, and hold off taking her test intill the spring instead of rushing things, allowing herself time to appreciate the world around her and approach the test with renewed calm.
1707	10578	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to show that she still has hope of finding home and being happy. The hibiscus plant in her mind is a symbol of home and happy memories with her grandmother. So when the plant buds, she will feel like she is at home again and is happy; that is when she will take the driving test, representing a step towards independence and control in her new environment. Also, that paragraph shows that she is slowly getting accustomed to the new home and lifestyle, “A flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks dear and—yes—familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now, like these geese.” This growing familiarity suggests a softening of her initial resistance and a gradual acceptance. Through these examples, I believe that the narrator put that last paragraph there to show Saeng's assimilation into her new lifestyle and her acceptance of her situation, highlighting her resilience and the possibility of finding happiness even in unfamiliar surroundings.
1708	10579	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng did not give up on the test, despite facing challenges. For example, she says ""I will take the test again."" It shows that she wants to take the test and pass it, demonstrating her determination. Saeng is going to wait until spring comes and when the snow melts to take the test, indicating her patience and willingness to prepare. In the beginning, the story introduces her taking the test, and it ends with her resolved to take the test again, highlighting her perseverance and concluding her journey with a sense of hope."
1709	10580	4	3	"At the end of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story through stating, ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" The author ends the story in such a way in order to reveal the hope that lies in Saeng's future. After failing her driver's test, Saeng returns home with disappointment and sadness. This last paragraph, however, shows that soon enough Saeng's luck will change. The reader is left with a hint that Saeng will retake her test and pass. Also, this ending paragraph reflects upon Saeng's determined personality to overcome many obstacles she is facing. This paragraph proves she will not give up even after she was forced to live in the United states instead of her home. Her success in fitting in with her new life is shown when through the quote, ""Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become... almost familiar"". Truly Saeng is a determined character, and the ending suggests that she will continue to adapt and persevere in her new environment, ultimately achieving her goals."
1710	10581	4	3	The reason the author concludes this story with the paragraph is to offer a sense of hope. The story is all about the girl missing her home country, and the concluding paragraph implies that the girl will adapt to her new country by the next year. The story and the paragraph show the girl's strength to overcome challenges, suggesting a positive outlook for her future. This is why the author ended the story with this paragraph, leaving the reader with a feeling of optimism about the girl's ability to adjust and thrive.
1711	10582	4	3	The author is letting us/reader know that they plan to do the same thing again next year when the snow is all gone, when the geese come back, and when it’s warm enough for the hibiscus flower to bud/bloom again! The author @MONTH1 will also be concluding the sentence to show that this is the life the little gardener chose, and she will keep up with new gardening till the next spring arrives once more.
1712	10584	4	3	Saeng concluded the story with that paragraph because it shows what she has just been through and feels she could go through it again. If she fails the driving test again, then she can use the plants to overcome her problems. She might actually pass the test this time. The unique plants show that she is stronger than she thinks and believes now that she feels comfortable with the plants that bring back memories of her childhood, giving her the resilience to face future challenges.
1713	10585	4	3	She shows that she loves her grandmother and she loves what they do like gardening and stuff like that. Her mother cares about her but she is really strict with her, always pushing her to excel in school and adhere to a rigid schedule. This creates a contrast between the nurturing environment of her grandmother's garden and the demanding atmosphere at home, highlighting the different kinds of love and expectations in her life.
1714	10586	4	3	The author concluded the story in such a way that the readerís eyes are opened. It shows the reader that dispite what happened in @MONTH1, how bad things seem, and how hopeless you feel, thereís always a way to make it better. Saeng failed her test, was in a new land, and had lost her grandmother, but still planned to try again. Like the waves on the shore, they will always try to wash away the sand by coming back again. Just like these waves, Saeng is willing to try again, as should we all, learning from setbacks and persevering towards our goals with renewed hope.
1715	10587	4	3	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because that season is over and a new season is starting, bringing with it the promise of change and different experiences. The narrative arc has reached its natural conclusion, resolving the conflicts and tensions built up throughout the story, signifying a transition to uncharted territory.
1716	10588	4	3	"The author concludes the story with ""when they comes back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt & the geese reture and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This quote meaning that once the flower buds she will take the test over again because Saeng will have the courage & the will to do it, knowing she will pass it. The hibiscus, a symbol of resilience and beauty emerging from harsh conditions, represents something to her that gives her motivation and determination. Everyone has something that motivates them in life to keep them going & Saeng has her plant. The author kind of gives you direction & idea where the story going to go also when the flower buds, suggesting a future filled with renewed hope and the promise of success."
1717	10589	4	3	"Saeng is not only just dissappointed from failing her drivers test, she is also upset and missing her home of Vietnam. Walking home she spots a little piece of Vietnam right there in the United States. She buy the beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to remind her of her past. The end of this story combines the two different countries, cultures and almost worlds her life is from. When she says, ""when they come back,"" she is referring to the geese. To her the geese symbolize her life in life in America and how she has became accustom to it. The hibiscus is also a symbol of her life. It is a symbol of her life and past in Vietnam, bringing back memories, and buying that plant was like getting a little piece of home. When the ""hibiscus is budding"" then she will attempt the test again. When this little piece of home gets bigger then she will try again. When she is more stable in the American culture, yet still has a firm grasp of her own, then she will be ready, finding a balance between her past and present."
1718	10590	4	3	I believe that the Author ended the story with this paragraph, because I think it is showing that Saeng isn’t a quitter. Despite the initial setback and her mother's expectations, Saeng's anticipation for the Hibiscus to bloom again reveals her resilience. Saeng can’t wait until the Hibiscus comes back. When the Hibiscus comes back she’ll retake the test and show her mother that she can do it, proving her determination and growth.
1719	10591	4	3	The reason why the author concluded the story with this paragraph is because when Saeng saw the geese, she knew that with the return of spring, she would be ready to seek out different flowers. She thinks back to her homeland and how she could witness the flowers growing directly from the earth. Although now in the city, she hopes the flowers will blossom like those she remembers from home, a place she dearly misses. Lastly, she describes the flowers as her friends, recalling specifically the Madagascar periwinkle growing wild from the cracks in brick walls or tiled roofs, a common sight there. Ultimately, the author conveys that Saeng is ready to embrace the coming season and search for plants reminiscent of her homeland, bringing a piece of it to her new urban life.
1720	10592	4	3	The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her driverís test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to Canada. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (ìÖand this hibiscus is buddingÖî), the author depicts Saengís change of attitude and her acceptance toward Canada. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driverís test. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saengís new adaptation towards the creatures of Canada. Prior to her imagination to the garden, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saengís mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to Canada (ìÖwhen the snow melts and the geese returnÖî). This shows Saengís development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing Canadian culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that Saeng undergoes, highlighting her growing sense of belonging and resilience in her new environment.
1721	10593	4	3	They conclude the story with that because the winter is over and spring is here, bringing with it a sense of renewal and hope, and it will be beautiful again, promising a fresh start and the cyclical return of life after a period of dormancy.
1722	10594	4	3	"The author concludes the story with, ""when they com back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again."" Then she will become more familiar. For example, the author says, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become , through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar to her now."" That tells me that she feels that over time, with continued practice, she will become more familiar with driving and then she will take the test again. Then she hopefully will pass it, demonstrating her growth and adaptation to her new environment."
1723	10595	4	3	The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî decided to conclude the story in that way because she wanted to tie in the theme of new beginnings. Saeng is new to America and has had a rough time fitting in. She misses everything about her old home, from her grandmother to the old plants there. Saeng fails her driving test, so she feels that all is lost. But the hibiscus plant helped her realize she has another chance. The hibiscus can survive the winter and bloom in the spring and that is what Saeng realizes she must do. The last paragraph said ìIn the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î Spring is the time for new beginnings: the geese return from the south, the flowers start to bloom, and Saeng can retake the driving test. In the last paragraph, Saeng realizes she wants a new beginning as well to be brought I the spring. In conclusion, the last paragraph ties the theme of new beginnings into the story. It shows Saeng's new realization and how the hibiscus inspired it.
1724	10596	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng really wants to pass the test. You know this when it says “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” This passage shows that she didn’t want to fail. When Saeng got home, she had the white bud in the pot, and her mother saw that she was crying. Then her mother was going to put the plant in the ground, but Saeng took the shovel and did it herself, finally realizing she could take the test again. This final act highlights Saeng's determination and reinforces her strong desire to succeed.
1725	10597	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. First, when the hibiscus buds in the spring, after a long winter of dormancy, that means that the plant, like Saeng, is about to bloom and come into its own. That also means that Saeng will be ready in the spring to take the test again, having used the winter to practice and prepare. Also the last paragraph is at the end because if the struggling hibiscus plant can persevere and thrive, then the girl, drawing strength and hope from the plant's resilience, can pass her driver's test and be happy both ways, finding success and inner peace.
1726	10598	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author is saying it's going to be a better year or some change is going to happen, and he feels he could have done better than what they did and is going to take that test again, aiming for a more satisfactory result next time.
1727	10599	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph to emphasize the new beginning that Saeng is looking for. She was so disappointed when she failed her driver’s test, and the hibiscus was the thing to make her happy. She needed a new beginning to start over in a new country, and the flower, the snow, the geese, and the test all symbolize new beginnings and challenges to overcome; the geese and snow represent a change in season, the budding hibiscus represents new life, and the passing of the test represents a milestone in Saeng’s life. Ending the story with this paragraph makes the reader expect something new and exciting to happen to Saeng, suggesting a hopeful path forward despite her initial setbacks and the difficulties of adapting to a new place.
1728	10600	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to explain to the reader that she isn’t done gardening, that she’ll go back when it blooms once again, signaling a return to her passion. Also, she isn’t done growing, learning, or finding solace in the earth. She’d rather garden than go to school, highlighting her preference for the tangible rewards and quiet contemplation found amidst the plants, suggesting a deeper connection to nature than to formal education, and leaving the reader with a sense of anticipation for her next season in the garden.
1729	10601	4	3	The author concludes this story with the few words “then I will take that test again” because she wanted us to know that she is not going to give up on something she failed once. She is going to keep going until she succeeds with passing “the test,” showing resilience and determination in the face of setback. This ending emphasizes her commitment to achieving her goal, conveying a message of perseverance and hope that resonates beyond the immediate context of the story.
1730	10602	4	3	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, ìItís flowers arenít pretty, but itís strong enough to make it through the cold months. here, this winter hibiscus. ìIt shows that the mother want Saeng to learn that Saeng should be strong even in times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, ìshe realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, through the quiet repition of season upon seasonÖî It shows that Saeng realized that the new place that sheís leaving right now is almost the same as their old home- the same cycles of life and growth. In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that Saeng should face the new reality of the world, understanding its cyclical nature. She should be strong and follow the flow of life.
1731	10603	4	3	The author concluded this story for an internal adjust. Saeng's memories are expressed through the one at the hibiscus. The spring is a season where everything is fresh and new. As by spring, Saeng's hope would be restored and thriving, when the budding hibiscus blooms, and they will have the ability to try at the test again with more strength and inspiration, suggesting a cycle of renewal and perseverance.
1732	10604	4	3	The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus in bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country, Vietnam, and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to America from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times. After Saeng buys the flower she vows to retake the failed drivers test after spring comes. Spring is a symbol of fresh start and renewal, mirroring Saeng's own desire for a new beginning. Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in America so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in America, facing future challenges with resilience and hope.
1733	10605	4	3	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because she failed the test and, made to appreciate nature a little better, now understands the true value of what she overlooked while striving for academic success, revealing a bittersweet irony.
1734	10606	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will return to the flowers again in the spring, drawn back by their beauty and the memories they hold of simpler times and the connection to nature that soothes her soul, promising a renewal of the spirit alongside the blooming season.
1735	10607	4	3	The author states that idea because if you can not do it once do it again. First, if you take a test and can't pass it the first time, do it again and you will be more likely to pass. For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test, so they could have let her take it again to see if she could pass it, perhaps with adjusted support. Second, she could ask for help from a teacher or use a book and study the material more thoroughly. For example, it will help you pass a lot easier if you study hard enough and understand the concepts. That is what I think the statement means; persistence and utilizing available resources can lead to eventual success.
1736	10608	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because its how each year will begin and end, marked by the familiar ritual of the town's annual Founder's Day celebration. This event, steeped in tradition, serves as both a remembrance of the past and a hopeful look toward the future, effectively framing the community's shared experience within the cyclical nature of time.
1737	10609	4	3	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wants to express to the reader that Saeng has been comforted by the hibiscus and is willing to give the test another try. She is now more open-minded about the situation. In the beginning of the story, Saeng was upset and annoyed about failing her driver’s test. For example, “the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. I-I failed the test,” Saeng said to her mother, showing she was clearly upset and disappointed in herself. The author didn’t want to end the story with a sad, unsatisfying ending, so Saeng changes her attitude about the test by the end of the story. For example, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” I believe that this attitude shift was because of the memories of her mother country that soothe her and also her mother's support. In conclusion, the author ended the story with that hopeful image to teach the reader a lesson: to allow for change to occur, understanding that time does indeed heal, and that new beginnings are always possible.
1738	10610	4	3	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with the motivational paragraph because he/she wants to show the reader that Saeng is determined to adapt to her new life and home and overcome common obstacles like a driver's test. Saeng had a hard time coping with her problem, so she bought a hibiscus because it reminded her of home and her grandmother's garden. I think that the line “and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” from the last paragraph is a symbol for growing up and overcoming obstacles, suggesting that when things feel more like home, she'll be ready to face her challenges. The conclusion for the story is a nice ending, showing Saeng's resilience and hope for the future.
1739	10611	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because when the snow melts and the geese return, she's going to have higher confidence in taking and passing the test. After she failed the test later on in the story, the geese had flown away, signifying a loss of hope. So, when the geese return, their familiar honking will remind her of what had just now happened, and her renewed determination. When the snow melts and spring comes, symbolizing a fresh start, the hibiscus flower, a symbol of resilience, will bloom once again, further solidifying her belief in her ability to succeed.
1740	10612	4	3	In the story ìWinter Hibiscus,î the spring represents the return of new hopes, comfort, and belief. As she says in the story, ìin the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î She perceives the hibiscus's return as a sign of renewed hope, giving her the courage to face the test again. Here, the hibiscus symbolizes hope. Secondly, when she says ìthe geese return and this hibiscus is budding, ì it represents comfort, especially with her mom's support bolstering her confidence, because believing in oneself is challenging without that maternal comfort. Lastly, she says, ìCanada geese flew by, their faint honks dear and yes familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetitions of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.î As the season progresses and the hibiscus begins to grow, she anticipates regaining the belief and strength necessary to retake the test; the hibiscus embodies new hopes, comfort, and belief for her, representing a cycle of renewal and adaptation.
1741	10613	4	3	"Coming back from failing her driving test, Saeng is comforted by finding the hibiscus flower. It brings back cherished memories about Saeng's homeland, because it is very similar to flowers that grew by her old home. The author concluded the story by saying ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to compare Saeng to the hibiscus. Like Saeng, the hibiscus must try to adapt to new surroundings. The author shows that Saeng recognizes this connection and is inspired by it. In Saeng's mind, if the hibiscus can survive being moved, then so can she. Just as the hibiscus waits for the right season to bloom again, Saeng will wait for the right time to try again."
1742	10614	4	3	The story of ìWinter Hibiscusî is a prolonged metaphor for both connections to a comforting past as well as expectance and the future. Saeng misses her homeland but she must learn to adapt to her circumstances, and pass her drivers test. The story is nicely concluded with Saeng's promise to herself that come spring, she will take the test again. The hibiscus flower itself generates this promise as it gives her some closure and alleviates some home-sickness. Saengís promise indicates that she is coming to terms with her situation. When she sees the Canada geese flying, she has somewhat of an epiphany about the seasons; this moment underscores her developing understanding of her new environment. ìAlmost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become.. - Almost familiar to her now.î This feeling, coupled with her resolve to retake the test, illustrates how she is accepting her new reality. I feel that was a landmark for Saeng and the conclusion illustrates that by allowing us to see her adapt and change.
1743	10615	4	3	In ìWinter Hibiscusî by Minfong Ho, Saeng has a deep emotional connection to the memories and flashbacks that the hibiscus brings back to her. At one point in the story, she cries out of mourning for her grandmother because the hibiscus plants bring back a wave of memories of her grandmother's care. Later on in the story, she takes the plant to her mother. At first her mother is upset but then she becomes understanding of her daughterís actions and feelings. Saeng is upset that she didnít pass her test and her mother understands that the hibiscus represents more than just a plant to Saeng, and that is why she brought it home. I think the author ends the story this way because wants the reader to see that because the hibiscuses is so important to Saeng and reminds her of her past, she will have a reason and motivation to continue and reach her goal of passing, connecting her present struggles to the strength and resilience of her heritage.
1744	10616	4	3	Since it is getting close to winter, the geese are going south. The plants are losing their leaves. Saeng says that she will take the test again. It seems that when the geese return and the hibiscus buds, it will give her hope and confidence. Especially the hibiscus, because it reminds her of her homeland and her grandmother; when she first saw it and held the leaf, it brought a tear to her eye, remembering her grandmother's gentle smile. And when it comes back next year, it will rejuvenate her spirit.
1745	10617	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks that it will explain what happened to Saeng very well. Perhaps the silence that followed her disappearance, the lack of definitive answers, stemmed from the very nature of the secrets she carried. The whispers and hushed tones surrounding her name after she vanished suggest a community grappling with something they couldn't quite understand or articulate. This ambiguity, this lingering sense of the unexplained, serves as a final, poignant reflection on Saeng's life, suggesting that some mysteries, like the echoes of forgotten songs, are destined to remain unresolved, leaving us to ponder the unseen forces that shaped her destiny and ultimately led to her enigmatic departure.
1746	10618	4	3	The author concludes her story with that last paragraph because it shows the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, and how much just seeing it feels. It also shows that the hibiscus motivates her because it reminds her of her homeland that she loves so much, and that it's like having a physical memory of her homeland, a tangible connection to the place she longs for, solidifying her determination and providing comfort.
1747	10619	4	3	The author is relating that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well. So you can compare Saeng to both the geese and hibiscus, because they too need time in a way for when they are ready to do what they do. Just like the geese follow their natural rhythm to return and the hibiscus waits for the right moment to bloom, Saeng understands her own internal timing for taking the test. In a way Saeng has molded as one with both objects, embodying the patience and natural progression inherent in both nature's cycles and her own personal growth.
1748	10620	4	3	I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolizes how the girl perceives things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, which means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being reminded of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy. This I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort and I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how the flower comforts her, showing the importance of familiar comforts in facing challenges.
1749	10621	4	3	the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it sounds like an interesting ending paragraph that has something to do with the story, hinting at the protagonist's uncertain future and leaving the reader to ponder the lasting impact of the events they have just witnessed, thus completing the narrative arc.
1750	10622	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that saying because it shows that she is adapting to the new place. It shows that she isn't going to give up, even though it's difficult. Just like the geese don't give up flying back and forth every winter and spring, she too will persevere and make this new place her home.
1751	10623	4	3	In the short story ìWinter Hibiscusî Saeng decides to retake her failed driverís test in the spring. She does so because she is comforted by the moderate weather of the spring. It reminds her of home, and Saeng is very closely attached to home, missing its familiar warmth. It reminds me of all the places Iíve been and how I still remember my favorite one. Like Saeng, I buy objects that remind me of my old home; for instance, I have a small snow globe that mirrors the winters I experienced there. Saengís commitment to her old home makes me feel less different when I miss my old home, suggesting that this longing for a past place is a common human experience.
1752	10624	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is going to start over and do better the second time because she doesn’t want to disappoint herself. She realizes her previous mistakes and is determined to learn from them. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, emphasizing Saeng's resolve for self-improvement and a more fulfilling future.
1753	10625	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story like this because it shows a new beginning. When the spring comes, everything comes back to life, signifying renewal. Plants grow back, animals are seen again, and the sun shines bright, ending the long winter. This is a new beginning for them, so it can be seen the same for her, offering a fresh start after a difficult time. She could try again because it gives her another chance to learn and grow, leaving past failures behind. Another reason he ended the story like this is because Saeng loves nature and finds solace in it. Maybe when nature is back around her in full bloom, it will give her hope and confidence to pass her test, drawing strength from the revitalized world around her. The return of spring serves as a powerful metaphor for her own potential for renewal and success.
1754	10626	4	3	The last paragraph of the story was: ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î I think the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that she is adapting and that she is starting to accept the change. I think that because throughout the story she is upset and not really liking the change. ìAnd in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.î The text says. This last paragraph seems optimistic talking about the flower blooming and the geese returning which seems like she is starting to accept the change and is looking forward to the future. The imagery of spring and rebirth further reinforces this sense of hope. In my opinion, the author added that paragraph to finish the story to show that Saeng is starting to accept the change and be optimistic, suggesting a path towards embracing her new environment.
1755	10627	4	3	Saeng told her mother that she failed the test. She asked what to make up for it, perhaps by helping out in the garden. Her mother nodded in agreement, then went inside and started to make dinner.
1756	10628	4	3	The Author concludes that when the geese come back she will take the test because she believes she will be more ready for the test then and it will be easier in the spring. This extra time will give her more time to learn and study, and hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home. It will be easier to complete the drivers test in spring with focused intention. She feels bad like she let her mother down for failing it, “I just stared at the hibiscus,” this tells that she felt too ashamed to even look at her mother after disappointing her. So next spring she wants to make her mom happy and pass, because she will be ready and more confident in her ability to succeed.
1757	10629	4	3	The reason the author chose this paragraph is because the paragraph means that when the snow melt and all the geese returned, the flowers **bloomed**. That one flower she had to **run** tests on.
1758	10630	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared for what's to come. In the story, the line “...Slowly fading into the distance” could mean she realizes what happens, happens, and to never stop pursuing a goal you want. One more reason she might have used this is that even though you're down, you have friends and family to pick you up from it and offer support. The line “...Through the quiet repetition of season upon season” basically says that she just needed to get into a routine, and she will be able to accomplish what she wants, suggesting perseverance through challenges ultimately leads to readiness and support.
1759	10631	4	3	The author concludes the story with this sentence because she wanted to make a comparison between flowers and the test. To finish with this shows she will try season after season just like geese come back every year. Since she tries to make a connection, it shows she hasn’t given up; she will keep trying year after year. Also, it says that this girl is determined and she won’t stop trying till she gets it right. Next, this last paragraph encapsulates the entire story's theme. Lastly, I think it gives a hopeful feeling for the whole story.
1760	10632	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph so the reader has something to think about. When the author concludes with something like that, he/she wants the reader to make their own ending or prediction. And sometimes it means a sequel may be in the works, leaving the possibilities open and sparking the reader's imagination.
1761	10633	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it makes the story a happy ending, showing how she doesn’t give up and is taking the test again. Also, she doesn’t want to disappoint her mom; she wants to make her happy and give the test a second chance, demonstrating resilience and a desire to fulfill her mother’s expectations, ultimately leading to a more positive resolution.
1762	10634	4	3	"She ends it with that statement to show that she is ready to relive spring in the new country now that she is comforted by the hibiscus. The test is adapting to the new country and she failed it she believes because she had to be comforted by her native plants, but she believes that she will pass the test next year because every repetition of the season allow her to become more adapted to the new culture. When she says ""when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again,"" all those things tell her it’s a new year and make it easier to accept what’s happening, giving her hope for a better, more integrated future."
1763	10635	4	3	She realized that things come and go but also change. That content times of the year the world around her changed. She had no control over it. She also had to deal with living in a new country. Living in a new country was hard for Saeng. She had to eat new foods, hear new sounds, and see things that she never had seen before. Failing her driver's test was hard for her; it made her feel even more isolated. Not knowing the language and what was going on around her was tough on her. The world around her wasn't something she was used to; it was a constant adjustment. She knew she had to change herself and work harder to get what she wanted, adapting to her new environment and pushing past the obstacles in her path.
1764	10636	4	3	The author ended the story with that paragraph to let the readers know that she did not give up. In the story, it seemed like she had thoughts of giving up, especially considering the challenges she faced adjusting to a new culture. But her thoughts of her homeland, the memories and values associated with it, comforted her when she thought she was going to give up. But the last paragraph of the story, through her explicit declaration, she confirmed that she wasn’t giving up on her dreams and aspirations, despite the hardships encountered.
1765	10637	4	3	I think the author concludes this story like this because they were beautiful, gave her good luck because the first time around she didn't know they were there. Their beauty, now recognized, seemed to usher in a wave of fortune, suggesting a newfound awareness and appreciation for the subtle blessings in her life.
1766	10638	4	3	"To me it seems like whoever was saying that must have been going through a lot of things and that they were feeling like they were being tested or something, or maybe somebody left her that she really loved because it says ""when they come back,"" so @CAPS1 thinking somebody @MONTH1 may have left or something. And the reason I said that the person @MONTH1 may have felt as if they were being tested is because it says ""I will take the test again,"" leading me to believe there's a sense of perseverance amidst hardship."
1767	10639	4	3	The author concludes the story with this because it shows that she is still uncomfortable. For example when she broke down in the flower shop, overwhelmed by a scent that triggered memories of her old life. This shows that even though familiar things can remind her of home, it isn’t the same; the context is different. You have to get used to and become accustomed to a new place, embracing its unfamiliarity. This also shows that she thinks with more time to get used to her new home, and to integrate these reminders into her new reality, that she will be able to pass the test and truly feel at peace.
1768	10640	4	3	"The author uses this conclusion for a reason. The reason the author uses this cliff-hanger of a conclusion is to keep the reader interested and wanting more. By saying, ""I will take that test again,"" the author makes the reader question if Saeng will pass the test next time and the reader will wonder what ""the test"" is, leaving them eager to discover the outcome of Saeng's future attempts and the true nature of the challenge. This open-endedness serves as a hook, encouraging continued engagement with the narrative."
1769	10641	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she probably doesn’t want the snow to melt so that the geese wouldn't return. Also, it informs the reader about what Saeng was thinking as she observed the changing seasons and anticipated the familiar sight of the geese gracing the sky once more, her thoughts reflecting a deep connection to the cyclical nature of life and the comforting predictability of the geese's return, ensuring a sense of continuity and hope.
1770	10642	4	3	There was a specific reason as to why the author concluded the story with that quote. The author wanted to show how the plant gave Saeng a new sense of determination. Saeng previously was upset and tearing the plant apart in frustration over her failed test. But It seemed that she realized, observing the plant’s resilience, how it was able to bud against the odds and survive despite her neglect. So she now was determined to battle the odds as well, face her academic challenges head-on, and retake the test she failed with renewed effort.
