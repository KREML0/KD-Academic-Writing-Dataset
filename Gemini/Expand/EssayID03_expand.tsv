1	5978	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The features of the setting that affect the cyclist is the lact of information on were to go and the lack of water. This was a problem because he needed water for his trip and directions on were to go. Consequently, the cyclist was hampered by the environment, creating difficulties for navigation and hydration, ultimately impacting the journey's progress.
2	5979	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way. He was in the desert, which is dry and hot. ìI was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). Also, the temperature was hot and made every thing around him hot, ìbrackish water faling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Since he was in the desert, there was no escape from the sun. The text states, ìThe sun was beginning to beat downî(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The cyclist was all alone in the road with none around him either so into he passed out, no one could help him. ì and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgous day in Juneî(Kurmaskie @NUM1). ""About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ëtowní but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The lack of people meant no readily available assistance or resources. These harsh, isolated conditions contributed to the cyclist's growing sense of vulnerability. The settings that the cyclist was riding in wasn't good ones and so they negativly affected him; causing him to be dehydrated and tiredin the end."
3	5980	3	3	Everyone travels to unfamiliar places. Sometimes we get lost and ask locals for directions which may not be a good idea. The setting affected the cyclist. He had a perfectly good map but asked older men who look like they havenít been out in ages. The old men apparently havenít been out because they gave the cyclist the wrong directions. My advice would be to not listen to anyone no matter their age if you have a perfectly good map with you. Also try to know where you are going at all times. ìYes, sir!î Therefore, relying on your own resources and preparation is often the best strategy for navigating unfamiliar territories.
4	5981	3	3	I believe the features of the cyclist affected him because he was impatient and trustworthy. He took the old man's advice to take an hour off his time by taking a shortcut. If he would have stayed true to the map, he wouldn't have almost died of heat, but his impatience got the best of him, so he took the shortcut. After his experience, he knew he has to stick to the map and not trust people who haven't seen changes in the last few years. He learned a hard lesson about trusting his own judgment and the reliability of established routes over the fleeting promises of strangers, ultimately realizing the value of patience and self-reliance.
5	5982	3	3	The setting effects the cyclist because if the setting were different, the story would not have made sense. The setting of the story is hot and dry with scattered ghost towns. When he reaches the first “town” he sees “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule.” If the setting did not have the problem of no water, so there would be no conflict in the story. In the story the speaker says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California,” that are very hot and dry, and he says, “This causes the problem of it being hot and dry if the setting was a forest in @DATE1 he wouldn’t have as much of a problem needing water,” which would have made the story much less exciting, demonstrating how crucial the desert environment is to the cyclist's predicament and the overall narrative's tension.
6	5983	3	3	There were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. For instance, it was extremely hot and dry. Also it was nearly deserted, almost all of the places he crossed were deserted. Another feature of the setting was a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule. This desolation likely amplifies the cyclist's feelings of isolation and the oppressive heat adds to a sense of struggle, making the journey seem even more arduous.
7	5984	3	3	The cyclist was riding through a tower-like rock formation when he stopped for directions. These old men, sitting in the shade, told him to take a short cut and he did, promptly getting lost. He found himself in a ghost town in the desert, tumbleweeds rolling past abandoned buildings. In conclusion the desert is hot.
8	5985	3	3	The effects of the cyclist situation, if it doesn't change, could hurt a lot of people's feelings because they seemingly don't care about the cyclist. I'm one of those people who doesn't care about it because it doesn't affect me or anyone I know personally. It is a big deal to white people, some of whom blow things up over it. They're talking on TV and on the radio, making all this stuff up, they say. I don't believe it until I see it for myself. That's not for black people because it hasn't done anything for us. We really don't care about the effects of the cyclist issue because it has no impact on our lives or community.
9	5986	3	3	The essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî describes a manís bicycle ride through California. Now, California is very hot during the summer, which is when the cyclist is riding. This setting greatly affects the manís journey. It made it very difficult for him to finish his ride. He drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride so he gets very dehydrated. The text states, ìThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.î He also mentions the sun beating down on him relentlessly. As you can see the setting makes this manís bikeride very hard. The oppressive heat, combined with his dwindling water supply, transformed a challenging ride into a true test of endurance, emphasizing how environmental factors can significantly impact even the most determined endeavors.
10	5987	3	3	In the story, ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî written by Joe Kurmaskie, represents how certain conditions can affect a cyclist. The cyclist was biking through the desert to reach Yosemite National Park, but on his journey he encountered many tough conditions to make it difficult to get there. First of all, the desert was very hot which makes travel very difficult. For example the text states, ìthe sun was beginning to beat down.î The intense heat makes any task difficult because the sun drains a personís energy. Secondly, the trip was very long so the cyclist had a hard time conserving water. For instance, the man drank so much water, he almost ran out; ìThe water bottle contained only a mouthful.î Running out of water in the desert can lead to dehydration which can cause death. Joe Kurmaskieís story, ìRough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î represents how certain conditions of an environment can affect a cyclist.
11	5988	3	3	The setting of the author’s “shortcut” affected his performance and strength tremendously. Whether it was the hills, heat, or barren landscape, all three took their toll on Joe Kurmaskie. Not only that, but his lack of water depleted his energy as well. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” The hills were a tough thing to pass since Joe was being drained of energy. He overcame this exhaustion when a building came into view. “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited with what I believed was my last burst of energy. I maneuvered down the hill.” The author overcame all the problems he faced even though it was difficult. He seems to have written this piece to exaggerate how important it is to keep going when you want to give up, demonstrating resilience in the face of adversity. Winston Churchill once said, “success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage it takes to continue that counts.” I believe that @PERSON2 agrees, highlighting the universal value of perseverance.
12	5989	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist very much so! The cyclist is riding through the hot desert. Meaning he needs lots of cold water to keep him hydrated. The longer he rides in the hot sun, the more he sweats, the more likely he will get dehydrated. Electrolyte imbalance is also a concern. If he was riding in the rain or snow it could possibly slow him down also, because he would be cold and his muscles might get stiff and not be able to move as fast. Therefore, the environmental conditions significantly impact performance and well-being. This is why the setting affects the cyclist very much so.
13	5990	3	3	"There was many features that affected the cyclist such as heat and lack of water. The cyclist was drinking a lot of water throughout the story and ends up only having little water left. ìI eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.î That shows he wasnít prepared with enough water for his trip to Yosemite. Without water he/she would die from the heat. ìWide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke"" This states that he understood the danger of not having enough water in his system, and the possibility of severe consequences. Features such as water and heat affected him/her throughout the story. Not having enough water could make him/her lose more sweat and the heat is making him lose even more sweat which can cause extreme heatstroke, highlighting the critical role water plays in maintaining bodily functions under strenuous conditions."
14	5991	3	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Initially, when the cyclist went through the road with the big snake in the middle of it made him keep cautious and very unease. Furthermore, the desert and nothing around gave the cyclist a feeling of abandoness and no help for when he is in trouble. Finally, the cyclist is greatly relieved when he sees the bait store and that people are there. The features in the setting greatly affected the cyclist on his ride.
15	5992	3	3	"The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, greatly affect the cyclist and put him through many hardships that he probably could have avoided. The old cottagers told him about a path they thought was right, but was hard and did not get him to the right place. The features of the setting are described as ""flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,"" soon becoming steeper and rockier, significantly increasing the difficulty of his journey and leading to unforeseen challenges. These unanticipated conditions, stemming directly from the setting, clearly contribute to the cyclist's struggles."
16	5993	3	3	In the essay Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the author Joe Kurmaskie uses the features of the setting to affect the cyclist. The cyclist is affected by these features because he sees the same setting (the desert) for several miles, he has no water and, the road has a lot of hills. The cyclist could been affected by seeing the desert and no scenery changes for a while. When you look at one same scene for hours you could start to get tired and bored with everything, and the lack of visual stimulation can impact one's mental state. So this cause him to be very drowsy and bored. Also the cyclist had no water as none of the fountains were cold water. Having no water out in the desert could make you dehydrate and faint, and dehydration can significantly impair physical and cognitive functions. Ultimately, these environmental factors combine to create a challenging and potentially dangerous situation for the cyclist.
17	5994	3	3	"Many different characteristics in a setting determine the outcome of an event there. In the story, ""Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist's journey was affected by a few weather-related things. The heat was an extreme element that slowed him down and in most cases deterred him from reaching his maximum level of ability because it caused fatigue. Also, the time of year in which this takes place greatly affects the cyclist, determining daylight hours and temperature consistency. Lastly, the type of road and amount of ground that he has to cover also affects his performance, influencing his speed and stamina. Overall, setting can be a determining factor in a journey as these elements significantly influence the cyclist's experience."
18	5995	3	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways. Since he is riding in the California desert, he always feels very hot and is always in constant thirst. In addition to this the area he is riding in appears to be quite desolate. He finds nothing but old abandoned buildings. He doesn't find anyone. No people or cars, or any sign of modern civilization. This causes him to feel a little unnerved as if something happened to him nobody would know about it, a feeling amplified by the sheer emptiness surrounding him. This is especially prevalent when he becomes dehydrated; his vulnerability is heightened by the unforgiving landscape. In those ways, the cyclist is very much affected by the setting, which actively contributes to his physical struggles and psychological state throughout his ride.
19	5996	3	3	In the story ìRough Road Aheadî by @PERSON1, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way the setting affects the cyclist is, in the desert, the cyclist drank more water than before. For example, the text states ìI had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. You will drink more water in a desert than in a forest. The arid environment necessitates increased hydration to combat the intense heat and prevent dehydration. If you go cycling, be aware of the settings around you because they will affect you. Therefore, one must adapt their fluid intake to match the demands of the surrounding environment.
20	5997	3	3	"Some features of the setting affected the cyclist. First the cyclist followed the old codgers' advice of how to get to Yosemite National Park. Their advice was no use and didn't help her in the end. Next, ""a tarlike substance oozed out"" of what she thought was going to be water, leaving her disappointed and without refreshment. Then the terrain changed to ""short, rolling hills,"" which wasn't helping her bike, making the ride more strenuous. Lastly, ""tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake"" slowed her down considerably. All of these road blocks in the setting affected the cyclist, hindering her journey and making it more difficult to reach her destination."
21	5998	3	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the lack of water, out of date information, and rolling hills. The rolling hills would make the ride more physically taxing, increasing his need for water. If he had up to date information then he would probably have got water from a town thatís not empty or almost empty like a ìghost townî as the cyclist said. This lack of reliable information combined with the demanding terrain creates a challenging situation for the cyclist.
22	5999	3	3	The cyclist has a couple of things to consider if he is racing, and if the wind is blowing, then there's a problem with balance and aerodynamics; he also has to follow traffic law and ride on the right side of the road, ensuring his safety and the safety of others. Therefore, cyclists must always be mindful of external factors and regulations.
23	6000	3	3	ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî had a rough setting between hazardous things and the death defying heat. The cyclist had to endure the pain of dehydration and determination. He had been given bad directions that almost caused him his life. He was travelling through a desert and claimed the temperature was 110. Also, the cyclist had to ration his water because it was ghost towns in which our character passed through. He used nature skills he'd once learned and began to suck on pebbles which take the mind off thirst and uses saliva to help refresh your throat. Throughout his adventure everything kept this young man from getting water and to whenever there was water any faster. He had survived and wouldnít ever take shortcuts again, realizing that sometimes the longer route is the safer route, and that lesson was learned through hardship and thirst.
24	6001	3	3	An example of the setting affecting the cyclist is when he has the lock of water in a ghost town in just eliterat. He finds the water, but a tar-like substance comes out and it tasted like battery. When he left, he had to go through rough roads, which meant he couldn't travel that fast because of the road's condition, slowing his progress considerably.
25	6002	3	3	"The cyclist had a very hard time getting to Yosemite National Park. This is because the sun was out, and it was in the middle of June. It was so hot out the cyclist became dehydrated faster than he would have on a cooler day, quickly depleting his water reserves. When he pumped the handle of the old rusted water pump, he said the water felt, ""somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" The cyclist also had to deal with a lot of ""short rolling hills,"" which was much more difficult to bike on than flat roads, constantly forcing him to shift gears. On top of everything else the roads were in very bad condition, so you had to watch for rocks in the road, making the journey slow and precarious. Ultimately, the combination of heat, hills, and hazardous roads made the cyclist's journey to Yosemite an arduous ordeal."
26	6003	3	3	The cyclist in the story is at first confident in accepting the old menís help, and doesnít seem to suspect anything is wrong when he first starts out. The way the men directed him seem all going for his water supply is all in store, and the first land mark, a ghost town now, is exactly where it is supposed to be, confirming the old men's directions. The next ìtownî he hits doesnít have anything that could replenish his diminishing water supply and he starts to feel troubled, a gnawing anxiety creeping in with each dry swallow. However he was told the next town wasnít further, so he pressed on, fueled by dwindling hope. Then the scenery makes a drastic change, the flat roads becoming hills, the sun beating hotter- it really look like a desert after tumbleweeds even go past! The cyclist continues on, despite being very dehydrated, his lips cracked and his vision blurring. The next thing to come along is an old juice building that almost seems to mark him on how he has no water, a cruel reminder of his parched state. He keeps on, however, driven by sheer will, and at last sees a shop where he can get water. The canging scenery sends the cyclist from confidence to worry, to hopelessness and lastly, relief, marking a journey defined by deception and the desperate need for hydration.
27	6004	3	3	Well I would put it like this is that the weather had everything to do with it because the poor weather can make you tired and upset, making you easily angered; so now it makes you upset and then stressed. Therefore, the weather significantly contributed to the negative emotional state.
28	6005	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in two ways: physical and mental. Physically, the terrain impacts the cyclist. Long and winding roads can cause exhaustion. A steep incline against gravity is also exhausting. Temperature is crucial to a cyclist's physical ability; riding in extreme heat can be unbearable. The cyclist can also be affected mentally. A deserted or desert-like terrain can trigger thoughts of dehydration and even death. Sighting dead animals or bones might induce fear of mortality. Circling vultures could inspire fear, especially if these elements combine in the same location simultaneously. Therefore, the setting's physical and mental challenges can greatly affect the cyclist's performance and well-being.
29	6006	3	3	The settings of the story were grveling. While the cyclist was riding along, the sun was beginning to beat down on him. The cyclist began to sweat due to the heat and thus he drank just about all of his water. Now the cyclist was experiencing major heat, sweat, and dehydration. The California desert is a grveling place to be, especially in June. Luckily, the cyclist did come up to a camp and found fresh food and water, before he would eventually continue his way to Yosemite National Park. He refilled his water bottles and ate some fruit, feeling much better prepared for the rest of his journey. The cyclist appreciated the unexpected kindness as he began pedaling once more toward Yosemite.
30	6007	3	3	As the cyclist is traveling to Yosemite National Park, he comes across many features in the area that affects him. First, he takes directions from some old guys who don’t know anything about the changes in maps because they never leave their porch. At first, it affects him in a positive way, because he thought he had a good shortcut to Yosemite. However, the affect later came negative because it turned out to be a shortcut that never existed, adding unnecessary miles to his journey. Another feature that affected him was the setting which was a desert-like area. The heat made it harder for him to ride his bike, and he also drank a lot of his water. This later resulted in him becoming dehydrated and significantly slowed down. A positive affect was when he found the bait shop, where he rehydrated himself and got some new directions, ultimately putting him back on the right path towards Yosemite.
31	6008	3	3	The features of this setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting is a desert so by common knowledge you know that it is going to be hot and dry. Because it is hot the cyclist needs more water because he is getting dehydrated, and when he is low on water, because it is dry, his mouth gets dry. Also, because he is in the desert, he sees wild, sometimes dangerous, animals; in the story he sees a ridiculously large diamondback snake, which I believe are venomous. Because of the extreme heat of the desert, he realizes that he had an increased chance of dropping from heatstroke. The writer said that the desert had short, rolling hills and rough road ahead, which would leave the cyclist worn out, and because of this terrain, the cyclist's speed is affected.
32	6010	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One example is the hot sun that was beating down on him made him very thirsty. Another feature is the rough road that wore the cyclist out and made him tired. My last example is the old juice factory with the picture of a refreshing cup of juice on it made the cyclist feel like giving up because he thought he would die of dehydration. These are my reasons as to why the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. The relentless heat intensified his craving for water, the uneven terrain sapped his physical strength, and the tantalizing image of juice served as a cruel reminder of his parched condition, pushing him to the brink of despair.
33	6011	3	3	In the essay the author writes of rough roads the cyclists had to overcome to reach their ultimate goal. These challenges, both physical and mental, tested their endurance and resilience, pushing them to their limits. The cyclists persevered through treacherous terrain and inclement weather, demonstrating unwavering determination to achieve victory. The journey, fraught with difficulty, ultimately underscored the magnitude of their accomplishment, proving their mettle and solidifying their place in the annals of cycling history. The arduous path amplified the sweetness of their triumph, making their success all the more deserved.
34	6012	3	3	Understanding, realistic, and mood—all are reasons how setting affects the story. If a book has a good setting, then the book might be pretty good. When you have a well-developed setting, it’s more understandable what the characters are going through. And if you have a good setting, it makes it more realistic. So, when you read it, you won’t be thrown off; the mood of the story sets it all off, because usually books have their ups and downs. That’s why authors chase the right mood, to create a compelling and believable narrative overall.
35	6013	3	3	"The setting of the story affected the cyclist by making him dehydrated, which could lead to a heatstroke. ""I could drop from a heatstroke,"" this shows that it was hot out, and he was feeling bad. The intense heat of the day was clearly taking its toll on his body, as the risk of heatstroke highlights how the environment was negatively impacting his physical condition."
36	6014	3	3	"The terrain during the cyclist’s journey greatly affects him. For example, the first terrain that he experienced was not very hilly, but rather flat and soothing. The author stated, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” This shows that he was energized and happy. However, the reader can predict that the journey will not remain this joyful, because the cyclist is basically in the desert during the summer, in which it is extremely hot, and such conditions are rarely easy to endure for long. Then, the cyclist experiences hilly terrain that sucked the life from his body, especially because he had no water left. The cyclist said, “sometimes life can feel so cruel"", emphasizing that the cyclist mood had changed from enthusiastic to tired and forlorn. This change of mood from the terrain can be connected to real life, as obstacles are included, in which the person must persevere and be strong to overcome, in which the cyclist finally did, demonstrating that one's environment and challenges can profoundly impact one's emotional state, demanding resilience in the face of adversity."
37	6015	3	3	The features in the story greatly effect the cyclist. One feature of the setting that effects the cyclist is the heat. At first, the story says that the pine trees cooled the cyclist, but eventually the forest turned into a desert, and the heat poured down on him, making it hard to cycle because of the intense temperatures. Another feature that effected the cyclist was the lack of water. As he moved away from his beginning point, the cyclist was drinking lots of water to stay hydrated during his ride. But when he needed to refill, the water was brown and hot, so the cyclist didn’t take any because of its undrinkable condition. The lack of water plus the heat formed one giant obstacle that potentially could have killed him, but through great determination the cyclist got through this troubling time, showing resilience against the harsh environment.
38	6016	3	3	The narrator in this story goes through a tough journey insisting of hope, challenge physical pain, despair, and relief. All of these are further developed by the settings where they take place, For example after taking advice from old men at a campsite, he is on his way through the deserts of California. If he had been almost anywhere else, his journey could have been much better. He could have gotten more reliable advice, or had been in a place where the towns were not miles and miles apart, isolating him further. Also, at one point he reaches a snake on the road, baking in the sun. This could symbolize a decision, which was to go and how it will affect the outcome of his trip, or perhaps the decisions he had already made. To take advice from strangers and better yet he should use it. The irony continues as he becomes dehydrated and the flat land turns hilly, increasing the physical demands. If that werenít to happen he could have been more successful and healthy on his trip. The setting in this menís story are necessary for if to have plot line and have the humour it possesses, particularly the dark kind that arises from hardship. If he were in the city, for example, he would not get lost and stranded, and therefore would have no story. In conclusion, the harsh environment of the desert is integral to the narrator's experience, creating the challenges and ironic situations that define his journey and give the narrative its unique, humorous edge.
39	6017	3	3	The setting in the story changes many times. It starts in an area with rivers and pine trees. Then the cyclist arrives at a town. After that he is pounded by the hot sun and along a hilly road. With not much water left, the cyclist uses all the energy he had to get to a town where he could get something to drink. The setting was what made the cyclist's journey a hard one, as the shift from a cool, wooded area to a hot, exposed landscape presented significant challenges to his endurance and hydration.
40	6018	3	3	"The features of the settings affect the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"". It is early morning and everyone is still asleep as the protagonist wakes up searching for something to occupy his time. When he pulls up to the first place, he observes that the residents seem old and perhaps a little eccentric, and he notices the dilapidated condition of the buildings, thinking the houses are falling apart. He then leaves and his eye catches the sight of wide, rolling hills. In conclusion, considering the early hour, the aging population, and the state of disrepair, I would never do all the riding he did."
41	6019	3	3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the desert with no water and doesnt know where he is going. The harsh sun beats down, and the sand stretches endlessly, disorienting him. The old men on the porch gave him wrong directions now he is lost in the desert. Dehydration sets in, blurring his vision. The cyclist find the will power to keep on moving and he finds help along the way. He pushes onward, driven by a primal urge to survive. He finds another old man there that offer him directions but he says he has a map. This reinforces his resolve to trust his instincts and find his own path to safety.
42	6020	3	3	The setting in the story discouraged the biker very much. As he follows the advice of the elderly men and starts off his journey he notices that there is, ìno one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.î He uses tone words to describe how had things are when he says, ìThe water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.î He describes in exhaust how hard his journey is getting, emphasizing his growing fatigue. He describes the intense heat in the desert of California, pedaling up, ì one long, crippling hill.î The terrain did not make his ride easy at all, further compounding his difficulties. The factor of weather, rolling hills, and the shortage of water take a tall on him; these elements combined to create a truly arduous experience. If he were on flat terrain on a cool day then he would have been first fine, suggesting a more manageable and pleasant ride overall.
43	6021	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. The hot sun beating down on him makes him sweat and makes him thirsty, constantly draining his energy. The bumpy roads and hills make him work harder, straining his muscles with each rotation of the pedals. The abandoned places make him lose hope, the desolate scenery a constant reminder of isolation. If faced with these obstacles I would have been affected in the same way, feeling the physical toll and the creeping despair. As I believe any human would be, these environmental factors are universally challenging, impacting both the body and the mind.
44	6022	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The features of the setting, or nature, affect the cyclist because they are wearing her out. The cyclist is going to the city of Yosemite, but some guys gave her a short cut. Through this shortcut are hills and heat and lack of water. @CAPS1 describes this by saying, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited.” @CAPS1 is excited that there is a building that @CAPS1 might get some water from. Also, @CAPS1 wiped the sweat from her eyes, meaning it is hot outside and @CAPS1 is sweating and losing water. The arduous terrain and weather conditions are physically taxing on the cyclist, as evidenced by her sweat and desperation for water. Therefore, the features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist's journey and well-being.
45	6023	3	3	The three most important features of the setting that effect the cyclist are the ground he is traveling, the towns he passes, and the availability of water. The ground the cyclist is riding over is important because the rougher the terrain, and the more hills there are, the more energy he must use, and the less distance he can travel. @PERSON1 is riding fine until he must travel the rolling hills which consume his energy, exhausts his water, and causes dividing hope. As he approaches towns, his hope increases but soon fades due to the realization that the town will be unable of giving him relief. When he pumps out water that tastes like ìbattery acid,î his hope once again diminishes. As he sees the bait and tackle shop, he knows he can make it there and that when he gets there he can recover. These three features of terrain, towns, and water are what effects the cyclist the most.
46	6024	3	3	In the story of ìrough road ahead :do not exceed posted limitî the setting affected the cyclist. In the middle of the desert during the summer the cyclist was low on water. The old men gave him the wrong directions, so mainly it is the old guys thought he dies. The cyclist survives, but the heat and the season he was riding, along with the near-fatal experience, will probably bring another water bottle next time.
47	6025	3	3	Some of the features of the setting affect the cyclist like the road was bad; it had bumps all over that made it much harder, and it also took up a lot of strength. Also, the neighborhood of two hundred degrees after that became a road with a bunch of hills, further impacting the cyclist's energy and slowing their progress.
48	6026	3	3	"In the story many different settings affected the author in many different ways. In the very beginning of his journey he came across a ghost town. He reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope. ""I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" He still has hope that he would end up safe and in the right place. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the rode. He grew worried when he saw that no near town was still in sight. ""This sight was troubling"" when the features of the next setting caught his eye he was desperate and devastated. ""At some point, tumble weed crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake"" He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water, when he reached the abandoned ice factory all his hope was lost and he was planning his death. ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" Finally, when he reached the fish camp, he was relieved ""I had overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, Kiss them and buy some bait."" He was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived, showcasing how dramatically setting can impact one's emotional state."
49	6027	3	3	Ghost towns are not exactly the most inviting place for a cyclist running low on water supply. In “Rough road ahead: do not exceed speed limit” the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright starts off as a good thing, while his mood is still fresh and happy expressions play on his face. But as he moves on he speaks of how “The sun was beginning to beat down” expressing his remorse of listening to the old men that led him on their “shortcut.” Along the road he comes to his first let-down, a ghost town with “one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest male.” He tries to pump the water from the pumps but gets a “battery-acid” flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink. This affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament. By the end he is relieved though when he comes to GARY & SON FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he “had an overwhelming urge to seek out GARY & SON, kiss them and buy some bait.” His thankfulness is expressed to men he doesn’t even know but because they were the light at the end of his long, dark and very exhausting tunnel, showing how crucial the environment is to the cyclist's emotional state.
50	6028	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. It was hard to arrive at the first town for the author. For example, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" The road that the author was riding was rough. Another example is, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" All the road was hills and rough, making the journey arduous. Then, ""The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips."" The author didn't have that much water. That was really hard, further emphasizing the challenging conditions imposed by the setting."
51	6029	3	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist a lot. One factor that would effect the cyclist would be the heat. Also, because of this factor, he's probably suffering from lack of water. He's probably really hot seeing he's the only one out in the middle of nowhere for what looks like miles, making the heat even more oppressive. Another feature of the setting that would probably effect the cyclist is the thought of there not being a car around this next turn. If he can't see around the next turn he doesn't know what is coming. The cyclist could also be thinking about when the next town will show up, adding to the mental strain of the ride. These environmental and mental challenges significantly impact the cyclist's overall experience.
52	6030	3	3	The setting puts a great deal of stress on the cyclist. The biggest issue he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist traveling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1 in June. He had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water. Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure.
53	6031	3	3	In “Rough Road Ahead,” a solo cyclist encounters several challenges. The changes in his environment directly affect the completion of his journey and his health. As the narrator makes his way to Yosemite National Park, his first encounter with his environment, none of the old men, acknowledges his need for water. The text states, “I had been rationing my water pretty regularly... in the high deserts of California in June.” Disappointingly, the truck stop’s water supply from the pumps was not adequate for his consumption, only forcing him to seek elsewhere to quench his thirst. Next, he experienced rolling hills; by expending more energy, he continued onward, still in need of water. His speed lost its quickness as thoughts of his crippling dehydration distracted him. Worse came his challenges, making his way to a bait shop as the heat beat him unmercifully. The change in his environment challenged his health and created an obstruction that nearly deterred him from his goal, illustrating how environmental factors posed a threat to both his physical well-being and his progress.
54	6032	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist a lot. One way was the heat. It got so hot that he was becoming dehydrated, his lips cracked and his skin felt dry. He kept drinking his water, until he didnt have any left. Another reason is because the road turned into hills which made him use more energy, straining his muscles with each uphill climb. Finally, it didn't help that he hadnt seen any sign of living creatures except for a snake, heightening his sense of isolation. @CAPS1 how the setting affected the cyclist. The harsh environment, from the draining heat to the energy-sapping hills and the unnerving solitude, clearly presented a significant challenge to the cyclist.
55	6033	3	3	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the main character, the cyclist. The cyclist is biking “through the high desert of California in June.” So naturally, it can be inferred that it is hot and dry, making water a delicacy. As the cyclist is passing through a ghost town and a pump that releases “a tarlike substance followed by brackish water,” he is running out of his precious water. The surrounding landscape of lonely hills, tumbleweeds, and snakes does not inspire confidence. In fact, the cyclist feels that “he could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” He finds an old Grape Juice Factory no longer in service, causing more anxiousness and despair. I have had an experience similar to this where I was out walking in a state park in the winter. I was freezing, and a desolate landscape of snow-covered trees made me feel as if I'd never be warm again, similar to the cyclist, whose environment made him feel he would die of dehydration. So, as can be seen, the setting of this short story affects the cyclist.
56	6034	3	3	The settings that affected the cyclist were in fact ones you don’t want to be near when you are out of water and tired from pedaling. The time and place affected him greatly because there wasn’t a cool breeze in the air in June at California; the heat was intense. He was in the middle of flat deserts and had no sense of where the gas stations and where civilization was, so he could get some water. The quote “old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” helped you realize taking advice of direction from old people who don’t go anywhere is a bad idea as their information is outdated. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills”. This quote shows you some terrain features that affected the cyclist, making his journey more physically demanding. Furthermore, the cyclist realizingly found civilization with running water, which was a much needed resource.
57	6035	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the author Joe Kurmaskie tells you that there are many things you have to go through before you get there. The example is when he stops and asks for directions to Yosemite. Because he didn't listen well to the directions, he got lost. When he had to ask for directions again and pass through other towns. The next example is when he came to a rock in the road and had to fix his tire. And he had to get water from an old rusted pump because he had really no water left in his water bottle after the tire change. These unexpected events and detours are just part of the journey, illustrating that reaching a destination often involves overcoming unforeseen obstacles.
58	6036	3	3	"The features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the terrain; ""flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,"" which shows that he is worn and troubled by the change of the terrain. He also feels alone; ""I toiled on, at some point tumbleweed crossed my path."" He also thought he was in a ghost town. ""Summertime"" rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain,"" suggesting he felt that he was slowly losing it. He also thought he was losing it; the sun had a great impact on him because he wiped his face to make sure he was not seeing a mirage. But through it all, he had hope. The author also wants us to have hope and keep on going, even though things don't look good; keep moving forward, never look back, and always be positive and take advantage of your surroundings. This is the message the author tries to give, encouraging persistence and optimism despite hardship."
59	6037	3	3	Heat, dry, flat - all are features of the setting that effected the cyclist. As the cyclist was driving through the desert, he noticed how hot it was, and how he would become dehydrated quickley. It was also very dry and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was. The flat ground models how there is nothing around that can help the cyclist, which made him scared, as he felt isolated. The story also metions that he is near a ghost town, all of which contributed to the cyclist's growing sense of unease and vulnerability.
60	6038	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the way that the author started talking and how he sounded at the beginning of the story. When they are both at the picture, he looks like he's assessing and then choosing. To the story and good continuity as one reads. It doesn't sound like he is enjoying his ride because of the noise he was down on the bumpy roads, sparks, and the bore of encountering thirst he didn't anticipate. He's extracting time and second person doesn't mix at all because there could be old timers who don't know once you are tailoring around her, to save, to go. One shouldn't take advice from them because one could end up like this mid-transition cyclist who doesn't understand how far it is or how one could now do it, to let someone therefore be dehydrated. This shows how the setting's harshness, combined with poor preparation, led to the cyclist's unenjoyable and potentially dangerous experience.
61	6039	3	3	"In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, there were many things that affected the cyclist. Such as the water. He had no really good water to drink because of where he was. ""When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid."" He wasn't able to drink the water because the ""battery acid"" that was in it could have made him very sick, further complicating his journey. Also, the unstable roads that he had to bike through made things hard. ""Rough roads ahead."" To ride on unstable ground can be very hard to do, demanding more energy and focus. So just these two examples, the water and rough roads, made the features of the setting definitely affect the cyclist, impacting both his physical well-being and his progress."
62	6040	3	3	In the essay ë Rough Road Ahead Do Not exede posted speed him if many of the featutres of the setting affect the cyclist. At first the cyclist goes by river wich he wount find later in the journey. As he goes along in the journey the heat and lack of water starts to affect him. Also he finds a water fountain that pours hot water with the flavor that has long since been shut down. The cyclist is affected by many features of the setting. The initial riverside offered a sense of ease he wouldn't encounter again. As the landscape shifted, the oppressive heat and dwindling water supply became tangible adversaries. The discovery of the defunct, hot water fountain only amplified his struggle, a cruel reminder of resources now unavailable. The cyclist's experience makes clear how powerfully the setting shapes his ordeal.
63	6041	3	3	The feature of setting affects the cyclist because the roads are too rough. If he goes too fast he could spin out of commission, and the water was trouble. He said, “when I tried a dip or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” Clearly, the harsh conditions, from the road quality to the undrinkable water, are severely impacting his ability to continue.
64	6042	3	3	The cyclist is mostly affected by his lack of water. In the beginning of his ride the cyclist is confident and is striving to reach the joys of @LOCATION1. He longs for, ìthe cool pines and rushing riversÖî (@NUM1). Later on when the cyclist reaches the rough terrain, he starts feeling exhaustion as he depletes his water supply. The sun beats down, intensifying his thirst. A bit of relief later comes upon him after a long climb over a hill until he sees a shut down juice factory almost seeming like it was put there to tease him. His destination fills him with relief and pride, knowing that he would survive the strenuous journey, a testament to his resilience.
65	6043	3	3	The setting effected the cyclist in a great way. The snakes blocked his pathways, and his short water supply made it hard to continue. He felt as if he could drop of a heatstroke in the arid conditions. His environment, and the information from the old man about the harshness of the terrain ahead, made his ride very hard to continue. All in all, his settings had a big effect on him.
66	6044	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the rode conditions. The rode was all messed up, making it difficult to maintain balance and speed.
67	6045	3	3	The cyclist was well prepared for his adventure, however, not prepared enuff for a change in senary. When the old men told him to take a difficult path, and he did, his in tire setting changed for the worst. After this, he was nearly overpowered by devastating hills, and dehydration was slowly creeping up on him as well. He had not nearly packed enuff water or supplies for a change such as that, and he would regret it later. The hills were steep and endless, and the sun was hot and mercilous, mankind it even worse on him. This is how the change of setting affected the cyclist, revealing the critical impact of unforeseen circumstances on even the most meticulously planned journeys.
68	6046	3	3	Setting can affect anyone and everyone, in this case it happened to be a cyclist. Since it was June, it happened to be pretty hot outside causing the cyclist to lose more body fluid due to his constant movement producing sweat. This makes water a must have, and he reached for his water bottle attached to the bike's frame, taking a long drink. Also, as he passes through, he comes across a sign that read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED. Since the road was harder to drive on, riding a bike across it isn’t much easier, and he felt every bump reverberate through his arms. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was the snake that blocked the road, which he thought of to be a diamondback, forcing him to carefully maneuver around it. Thus, the environment presented challenges influencing his journey.
69	6047	3	3	The features of setting really affect the cyclist because of the condition. For example, the weather; if it’s hot, it will slow the person down, potentially causing dehydration and exhaustion. And if it’s perfect, with a cool breeze and sunshine, that will let the person go at a regular, comfortable speed. And the roads; if the road is bumpy, filled with potholes, that will slow them down and increase the risk of accidents. And if it's smooth, newly paved, that will speed them up and make for a more enjoyable ride. See, it really does depend on the condition, highlighting how environmental factors significantly impact a cyclist's performance and safety.
70	6048	3	3	"The setting affects the author a lot. First, he is in a California desert in the middle of June. It is very hot out, with the sun beating down relentlessly. This makes the cyclist very tired and sapped of energy. There are some cool pines offering shade, but they don't help much to alleviate the overall heat. There is also nowhere to get water for a very long time, compounding the physical strain. The narration states, ìI eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). With no water, the cyclist was dehydrated, leading to a decline in his physical condition. This hurt his biking skills like balance and leg strength, making the journey even more difficult. Finally, there was no one around for most of the story. The cyclist did not know how far he had to go until he reached @CAPS1 or water. There was also no one to help him if he were to have a heat stroke, increasing the danger of his situation. Thus, the harsh setting significantly impacts the cyclist's physical and mental state, creating a challenging and potentially perilous experience."
71	6049	3	3	In the story ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî the features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist traveled miles on a bike dealing with the harsh weather in the deserts, carrying a little bit of water, and battling exhaustion. The cyclist faced many hard times trying to travel on a bicycle from one point to another, struggling against the vastness and demanding conditions of the environment, ultimately testing their physical and mental limits.
72	6050	3	3	The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclistís attitude and adversities. The path of the cyclist is through California deserts, which are dry and hot. This first presents the major conflict of the story, the danger of the cyclist getting heatstroke. In the reading, the author says, ìI had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularlyî If the setting was in a cooler climate, the author would most likely not drink as often, and would not face dehydration. The trip would not have been as dangerous for the cyclist if the climate was different, as the risk of heatstroke would be significantly reduced. Another element of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. In the reading it says, ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î The rough road not only would take a toll on the author's body, but also his mind. While riding, the author thinks, ì I was doing a water-depleting 12 mphî This shows how his attitude is getting less and less optimistic as well as keeping his mind on his thirst. Thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty, exacerbating his discomfort. The small change in terrain had a large impact on the author's journey. Perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the isolation. Only until the end of the story does the cyclist run into another human. Up until that point, He was all alone, having to deal with his thirst and fatigue on his own. If the setting had been in a more urbanized area, the cyclist could have gotten help from other people, which would have made his ordeal very easy. Also knowing that nobody was going to help him played a large role in the mental state of the author. In conclusion, the conflict of this story was set up by the setting. If the setting were not hot, rough, and isolated, the cyclist would have had an easy journey, and the story would not have been as exciting or interesting. A different setting in my opinion would have ruined the story and its inherent tension.
73	6051	3	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist was going through the desert, it had be dry old, dirty ìÖ. I came to a fork of sorts, One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnít hold in the largest mule greeted me. This side was troubling. ìwhen she wanted to us the rusty water pump farlike substance oozed out and the water seem like to be @NUM1 degrees. ìNot two miles into this next section of ride, I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. ìThis made it more difficult for the cyclist to ride the bike. This would make the cyclist more tired. As the cyclist moved on it was getting more tire and his water supply was going down. It was try me to keep his balance while he kept riding. The initial flat terrain had offered easy movement, but the hills now demanded more energy. The cyclist's increasing fatigue, combined with the dwindling water supply, presented a significant challenge to maintaining balance while riding, highlighting how the changing environment directly impacted the cyclist's physical and mental state.
74	6052	3	3	"The setting of the place affects the cyclist because it's too dry, making the cyclist thirsty; they shouldn't be in a place that's dry. Like in the story, it says, ""I was travelling through the high parts of California in June,"" meaning it was really hot and dry, which is not ideal for cycling long distances without proper hydration. Secondly, the animals there are dangerous. A cyclist shouldn't be riding in a place with diamondback snakes. It says in the text, ""I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path at a ridiculously large skirt; it really did look like a diamondback,"" which, if it really had been one, would be really dangerous. Cyclists should not be riding in that type of dangerous place, no matter what type of danger there is, as safety is paramount. That is how the settings of the surroundings affect the cyclist, highlighting why it's a bad place for them to ride due to the harsh climate and potential wildlife encounters."
75	6053	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the ground changing terrain a lot, making it difficult to ride at the same speed the entire way, and the constant adjustments would be tiring. Also, the lack of water made it hard to focus, hindering performance and potentially leading to dehydration. I think the features of the setting affect the cyclist by people thinking they are worse than they actually are, adding psychological pressure on top of the physical challenges. The combination of difficult terrain, dehydration, and external pressure would create a formidable obstacle.
76	6054	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The setting affects the cyclist because the weather is very hot and humid which makes him sweat, which is using up energy because his body is trying to stay cool. Also the setting affects the cyclist because there is no water, so on top of sweating being out of energy he has no water to refuel his body, which makes it very hard for him to keep going. Ultimately, the harsh environment severely hinders the cyclist's performance and endurance.
77	6055	3	3	In this story the cyclist is going through a desert of California. This is a reason why he is very limited on water supply. It is really hot which would cause him to drink a lot more water. He had started his journey in the morning so that the sun wasnít as hot as it would be in the middle of the day. Then it started to get a lot more sonny. So with the sun comes more heat. The rider says ìThe sun was beginning to beat down.î This would help the readers realize what time a day it was and how hot it was. This was in the morning so he didnít realize it but as it got into the afternoon he realized it and started to get dehydrated. The air shimmered above the asphalt, distorting the already desolate landscape. He knew he had to ration his remaining water carefully if he wanted to make it to the next town. The increasing heat was a stark reminder of the desert's unforgiving nature.
78	6056	3	3	The wonderful features and settings had a dramatic affect on the author. The affect was bad rather that good. First, there was the almost unbearable heat, radiating from the seemingly endless sand. The author had a limited amount of water and used a lot of it because of the smoltering temperatures. Another feature that had a great impeidence on the authorís well being would be the lack of water in the pumps he stumbed across at the snack stand. Lastly would be the tar-like substance that came out of the pump when author tried to get water. There was also Brackish water in the well that tasted suspiciously like Battery acid, which only exacerbated his dehydration and discomfort, ultimately contributing to the overall negative impact of the environment on the author.
79	6057	3	3	"The cyclist is traveling through a rough part of California during the hot month of June. The author describes part of his journey; ""I was traveling through the high deserts of california in june."" The heat of the sun and not much water around is causing the cyclist to worry about his health. A little further into his journey realizes how bad he could get if he doesn't find water soon. The author writes, ""the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke."" As the cyclist has run out of water & there is no sign of life around, he begins to feel that he will never make it through the desert to yosemite National Park. The author describes this ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" The setting of the cyclist's journey greatly affected how he perceived his journey, creating a sense of desperation and highlighting the brutal reality of the arid landscape, ultimately shaping his grim outlook."
80	6058	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of where he is. The biker is in a campground in California. By saying that, one could sense it is a dusty place. Also, when the story says that the “town” had been abandoned, this also tells us that the place the cyclist is in is a deserted place without many people or places to stop. The story also talks about a snake in the road, suggesting the area is untamed. A snake in the road tells one that the town is deserted; I could tell that this “town” is deserted because around here, people do not go in towns that don’t have buildings. If a snake was in the road, then the town must be empty because around here streets are busy and there are no snakes in the road, leading the cyclist to face challenges due to the isolated environment.
81	6059	3	3	The setting greatly affects the cyclist because he is the one riding over ìshort rolling hillsî and around a ìridiculously large snake,î and because it's hot, he could suffer from heatstroke at any minute. The sun beats down, reflecting off the asphalt, and the air shimmers with heat, making each pedal stroke an exercise in endurance. This oppressive heat, combined with the demanding terrain and unexpected wildlife encounters, creates a perilous environment for the cyclist, making the setting a significant factor in his ride. So yes, the author is affected by the setting.
82	6060	3	3	The affects of the features around them affect them by the hot bikes, so the bikers need water, and also it affects them by the roads being so hilly, so they can't just road straight; so they need to go over the hills, and that affects them because cycles are very hard to land from a jump, making navigation challenging. Therefore, the environmental features significantly impact the bikers' experience.
83	6061	3	3	"The features of the setting in Yosemite give the cyclist something to look forward to, but the feature of the scorching sun that he is enduring to get there causes him despair. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and notices the sweltering heat of the sun during early endeavors of the trip he checks himself up as he says,""I barely noticed it [the sun], the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" Although the cyclist began to feel the toll that the trip and the sun was going to take on him, he erased the morning with the hope and beauty of arriving at Yosemite. The more the cyclist noticed the sun the more he drank until his water supply seemed low, stripping as an old rusty water pump he had hope of being replenished but the taste of bitter battery acid caused the cyclist to stop drinking. The rolling hills, Sun and tumbleweeds did nothing to quench the cyclist's thirst or at least divert his attention. If the cyclists was to see a sign that said Yosemite 50 miles away his spirits would have risen, instead he saw a sign that said, ""Rough Road Ahead"" which did nothing to help him. If the terrain was more prosperous, easier to travel on and in plenty supply of water, the tune of this passage would be more hopeful instead of such despair; ultimately, the harsh features of the setting caused the cyclist grief instead of hope."
84	6062	3	3	The bike rider in the short story ìDo not exceed posted speed limitî by @PERSON1, is greatly affected by the condition of land around him. He is riding through the extremely dry desert and is running low on water. The sun beats down relentlessly, intensifying his thirst. However since it is such a dry place he canít find any. The cracked earth offers no respite. Also since it is out in the middle of no where, there is no one he can ask for some. He scans the horizon, but sees only shimmering heat waves. If this story was set somewhere else he wouldnít have has either problems. Therefore, the arid landscape directly contributes to the rider's desperate situation.
85	6063	3	3	"In ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Many visual features create a very deserted area that's hot in your head. For example, in paragraph five, they use a lot of adjectives to describe how abandoned the place was, words like ramshackle and rusty. Also, how often the lack of water was brought up made us think of how hot this California desert must have been. The relentless heat made the cyclist believe he was seeing a miracle when he saw the Welch’s fruit juice factory. The choice of visual words in this story are specifically chosen to describe what affected the cyclist, emphasizing the harsh and desolate environment he was enduring and ultimately shaping his experience."
86	6064	3	3	In the passage, the cyclist had about @NUM1 different settings. One of these settings were the rough terrains he had to pass through where he lacked on the amount of water. Another setting the cyclist had to go through was the hill like terrains, where he was laughing at himself for taking the old men advice in the first place. Both of these features had a great tall on the cyclist body strength and his spirit. But with confidence, determination, and the relief of the success he was able to overcome the obstacles, ultimately proving his resilience.
87	6065	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the weather in California in June was hot and the water the cyclist found in the pipes was hot, as well. The text says, ìSomewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.î This affected him because he had no water to drink from, exacerbating his dehydration. Another example is when he had to overcome tumbleweeds and snakes. The text states, ìtumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.î This was an obstacle that he had to overcome, slowing his progress and adding to the challenges of the ride. Another example is he was deserted. The text says, ìno one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.î This isolation amplified his vulnerability to the harsh elements and any unforeseen mechanical issues. Thus, the setting's heat, obstacles, and isolation all compounded to significantly impact the cyclist's journey.
88	6066	3	3	The setting in the features of the cyclist is that if it is too hot or too cold, it could affect how the cyclist is riding. If it's too hot the cyclist would get exhausted a lot faster. And if it's too cold then the cyclist would possibly get sick. Also if it's too windy then he would go a lot slower if he is going against the wind's direction, but faster when traveling with it. These environmental factors clearly demonstrate how external conditions can significantly impact a cyclist's performance and well-being.
89	6067	3	3	The features that affected the cyclist were plenty of things. One thing would be lack of water; hydration was crucial for his endurance. In the text he said the pump gave water that tasted like battery acid, so he couldn't rely on it. Another one would be all the surroundings changed from what the old men said, and he got lost, disoriented in the unfamiliar landscape. When he was lost he had to have determination to find someone, to have faith that he could survive and eventually find his way. Therefore, the cyclist's journey was affected by unreliable water sources, navigational challenges, and the internal fortitude needed to persevere.
90	6068	3	3	The setting and it`s features affect the cyclist greatly. He is in the desert and all the town's are abandoned. Also he now hits a sign that says ìRough Road AheadÖ(kurmaskie, pg @NUM1). This makes his trip even worse because now he has to make it over not only big hills but torn up, old, beaten roads. And he has the sun beating down and is almost out of water, adding to his physical strain and mental anguish as his journey becomes increasingly arduous. The combination of difficult terrain, scorching heat, and dwindling supplies creates a truly challenging situation for the cyclist.
91	6069	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him obstacles to overcome when he had to go down the winding hills; he would have to slow down so he could maneuver the hills and not lose control of the bike. The heat he was facing would cause tiredness and dehydration. If exposed to the sun and heat long enough, you can get a sunburn or suffer a heat stroke. A heat stroke can be fatal to anyone, especially those with heart problems. Dehydration also can be fatal if not addressed quickly with fluids. If the cyclist does not see any buildings, he would not be able to tell where he is, and he might get lost because of it. Getting lost will also lead to dehydration, tiredness, and heat stroke, compounding the dangers he faces and making his ride significantly more challenging.
92	6070	3	3	The setting and features affect the cyclist because with each building he hopes for water, but since he is traveling through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the wasteland. These buildings create a feeling of relief in the cyclist only to be followed by despair to find them abandoned and devoid of the life-sustaining resource he desperately seeks. The featureless land also amplifies the feeling of lost hope in the rider, making his entire ordeal that much harder as there are no landmarks to guide him or offer a sense of progress. Over all it was an excruciating experience physically and mentally for the cyclist, testing his limits of endurance and will.
93	6071	3	3	In 'Rough @CAPS1 Ahead' the features of the setting and the cyclistís surroundings greatly influence him. Because he is in ìthe high deserts of California in June,î the climate is hot, dry, and miserable. The sun beats down relentlessly, adding to his discomfort. Another feature of the setting that affects the cyclist, is that he is out in the middle of nowhere. There are no other human beings, cars or buildings for miles, emphasizing his isolation. Also, the terrain affects the biker. When the road starts to get bumpy and uneven, it causes him to exhaust his water supply even faster, increasing his vulnerability. Overall, the cyclist in this story is greatly affected by his surroundings.
94	6072	3	3	In the short story the cyclist was affected by the setting in many ways. The author was running out of water throughout the whole story. ìThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.î There was a limited amount of water in the bottles. He had to travel a long distance. ìNot two miles into the next section.î He was getting tired quick. Also the terrain was not good. ìI noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î This made it even more difficult as he continued. It get harder and harder to continue his ride. The combination of thirst, distance, and difficult terrain significantly impacted the cyclist's journey, making it increasingly challenging to proceed.
95	6073	3	3	The cyclist was so set on seeing cool, piney trees and lakes, that when he saw dirt, snake, and no source of civilization worried him. More affectively, what he didnít see scared him most. He did see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees. He didnít see any people or friendly little forest critters. Instead he just saw the same rusty color of dirt and the occasional snake slithering across his path. His mood was affected and he started to lose confidence and hope. He wasn't used to the new surroundings and for a while doubted if he could even make it out alive. When he came across the run-down building of Welchís factory, he was even more distraught. Fortunately, he did find civilization when he came to a fishing supply shop. This definetly boosted his spirits, as it was the first sign of other people he had seen in what felt like forever. Once he had saved his thirst problem with a cold drink and assured himself he has alive and would luckily stay that way, he sat down before wading out again in search of his destination, now with a renewed sense of determination.
96	6074	3	3	The features in the setting are not very good for the cyclist. He’s in California in June, and it’s very hot. It’s pretty much a desert, the sun beating down mercilessly. When he stops for water, desperate for relief, the pump he finds does not have any more water in it except for a few drops. Also, the few drops that he does get taste like battery acid. So this is not very good for the cyclist, leaving him in a precarious and dangerous situation.
97	6075	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the author changes the mood by not only telling us how the cyclist feels, but also by describing his environment. As he's leaving the “reservoir compound,” he’s feeling pretty good because he’s just leaving “the serenity of an early-summer evening” and he’s headed toward “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” He’s in a beautiful setting and this affects the cyclist because he’s anticipating another one. However, when he moves to the “ghost town” and the “sun was beginning to beat down” he’s less confident and becoming more doubtful about the men's advice. Still, he’s optimistic, finding it funny that it was once “a thriving little spot.” Next, when the cyclist comes to “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral,” he knows that things are in bad shape and he is desperate for water. However, all they have is a “tarlike substance,” so he moves on, having no choice. When he comes to the “rough road tumbleweeds and a ridiculously large snake,” it affects the cyclist by letting him know that things are at their worst and he can either give up, or keep pushing through. He doubts it could get any worse, and so does the cyclist. Finally, at the end the cyclist enters a rather modern bathroom” and things are back to civilization for him, so he feels relaxed, relieved and much better, showcasing how the shifting landscape mirrors the cyclist's fluctuating emotions throughout his journey.
98	6076	3	3	There are 3 features of the setting that affects the cyclist on his journey. There is a lack of water, in the middle of nowhere, and nobodyís there. Due to lack of water, this feature really affects the cyclist. He will need water in all to move and get through his journey. Water is the main thing he should have. He could end up getting dehydrated and might cause him to die right in the middle of the street. Therefore water is one feature that affects the cyclist. Furthermore heís in the middle of nowhere. There is no buildings or nothing around, not even gas stations so where it is can stop and if he had money he would be able to buy about 2 or 3 bottles of water and maybe even a few snacks. That is another feature that will affect him. Lastly nobodyís around town in able to help him out or anything. Letís say that he gets lost and heíll need direction to get wherever heís going well thereís nobody around in able to help him get around or anything. In conclusion those are the 3 main features that will defentily affect the cyclist. These conditions create a challenging and potentially dangerous environment for the cyclist, emphasizing the importance of preparation and self-sufficiency.
99	6077	3	3	The settings affect the cyclists for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isnít very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it will not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist.
100	6078	3	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist by him going through obstacles to get to town. The setting was in a desert in California in June. The relentless sun beat down, making the already challenging ride even harder. The cyclist also had a lack of water, his throat parched from the arid air, and when he found a pump he said it was black and tasted like battery acid, offering no relief. And then he stopped for directions, hoping for a shortcut, but the men gave him the oldest set of directions, likely sending him further out of his way. So the cyclist said he would stick to his trusty map, trusting its accuracy more than the unreliable locals in this harsh environment.
101	6079	3	3	"In the text, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. For example, the text states, ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, or structure of any kind.î This made the cyclist very lonely and they started to lose hope of finding water, feeling isolated and exposed in the barren landscape. Secondly, the text stated, ""In an ironic twist the building abandoned years easlier, by the looks of it-had been a Welchís Grape Juice factoryî This made the cyclist lose more hope, after he thought the building would have people in it and he got excited at the prospect of human contact and assistance, only to be met with disappointment. Lastly, the text states, ìGRAPE AND @CAPS1íS FISH CAMPî The sight of this building gave the cyclist hope and happiness for finding a place to get a drink, signaling a potential end to their thirst and a return to civilization. The settingís features greatly affect the cyclist's feelings, demonstrating how the environment can impact one's emotional state and sense of well-being."
102	6080	3	3	"The features of the setting made the cyclist’s ride longer and harder than he expected. When the cyclist first headed out the road was flat and smooth. Halfway through his trip the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. The cyclist continues to pedal even though he was slowed down to 12 mph. The hills made the ride slower and harder because of the increased exertion required to climb them. Towards the end of the hills he had to make it over one long, crippling hill. The word ""crippling"" is used to show the physical affect that the hill had on him, implying a great deal of strain. The hills were a feature of the setting which made the cyclist’s ride longer, harder, and more physically demanding."
103	6081	3	3	There are numerous features in the setting that affect the cyclist. For example, the rough road made for difficult riding. Another example is the tumbleweed, which blew across the path, and the snake also affected the cyclist by startling them. In conclusion, those are the reasons the setting affects the cyclist and their journey.
104	6082	3	3	Sun, amount of miles, people all are reasons why the setting affects the cyclist. For example, the sun was beating down on him every time and the cyclist seemed to complain that it was so hot. Also, he said that he really didn’t seem to notice it though in his mind it affected the cyclist. Next, the amount of miles that the cyclist was biking affected him mentally because people kept telling him how much farther he had to go which discouraged him. Therefore, the environment significantly contributed to the cyclist's experience, both physically and psychologically.
105	6083	3	3	The setting is like a desert with no water or people civilizations anywhere around him. This made him more worried because if he died, no one would know for days or weeks probably. The sun beat down relentlessly, intensifying his thirst and fear. He scanned the horizon, a shimmering expanse of sand offering no hope of rescue or solace. The vast emptiness pressed in on him, amplifying the sense of isolation and the chilling thought that his fate rested solely on his own dwindling strength. This realization deepened his anxiety, knowing that survival depended on his ability to overcome the harsh conditions and his growing despair.
106	6084	3	3	There were several features that the cyclist encountered, and all of them affected the cyclist. For example, “several rusty bumps,” is a quote of the text explaining that he wasn’t riding on smooth ground; he was riding on rough, hard, bumpy ground. Also, he had a huge lack of water; he was water depleted. He couldn’t even go the speed limit, he was going 12 mph, he could have been going 55 mph. “Rough roads ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit,” this is another quote expressing the dangers in the ride that he was risking, adding to the challenging conditions. All these things, the terrain, and lack of hydration, made the cyclist uncomfortable, dehydrated, and very tired, ultimately hindering his progress and overall experience.
107	6085	3	3	The setting in ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî was a very large factor of the story that was actually the cause of the protagonistís problem throughout. First it started off with the large hills he had to ride up, making him work harder and tire himself out quickly. Next the big problem was the heat of June, ì and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because î The heat was so really bad because it made him hot, thus depleting his water supply [which he needed to survive] and it gave the large, almost inevitable risk of falling from a heatstroke and dying. The relentless sun beat down, baking the asphalt and radiating back up, intensifying the feeling of dehydration. The heat also made the abandoned Juice Factory all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist. ìA sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.î In this desolate landscape, the factory served as a cruel reminder of what he lacked: refreshment and escape from the oppressive conditions. @CAPS1, in the unbearable heat with no water left and @CAPS2 knows how many miles left to cycle, this really made him feel like the sorriest, unluckiest man in the world. The setting overall, seemed almost crafted to make the protagonist not only suffer from the natural elements, but from things that seemed meant purely taunt him for it. The harsh environment, with its physical demands and psychological torments, truly became an antagonist in itself, exacerbating his struggles and pushing him to his limits.
108	6086	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is hard to go far on a bike when the place you are riding is dry, abandoned, quiet, hot, cold, and straightforward. It tells you that the setting is abandoned when it says ""there was none in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind."" This would make it hard for a cycler because you need a good water supply, and that's hard to keep when there is nothing around to offer resources or shelter from the elements. This harsh environment ultimately impacts the cyclist's ability to travel any significant distance."
109	6087	3	3	The cyclist chose to take an old abandoned route to @LOCATION1. The route had in some places no buildings at all to see, making the cyclist lose hope of his need for water. Until the end, there was no one on the route, making him all alone. So if something happened, who would know? During his adventure, he ran out of water, making him dehydrated; that didn’t help his already dwindling spirits. The setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist, a lonely and desperate struggle against thirst and isolation.
110	6088	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist very much. The text says, “The sun was beginning to beat down” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The hot sun was making the cyclist sweat profusely. He was losing water and electrolytes. This was making him dehydrated faster and weakening his muscles. The text says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The hills the cyclist had to ride up were wearing him out considerably. He was getting tired faster as he exerted more energy to climb them. The text says, “I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink” (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The modern bathroom had good, cold water readily available. This allowed the cyclist to drink from it without hesitation. The water replenished the cyclist, allowing him to regain some of his lost strength and continue his ride. Therefore, the environmental features had both negative and positive impacts on the cyclist's journey, influencing his physical state and ability to proceed.
111	6089	3	3	In the essay “DO NOT Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” it is clear that survival is the main concern, as the man seems to be fighting to stay alive. While cyclists often pedal for hours, even hundreds of miles, if he were biking where green grass and cool mountains meet, the tone and mood of the essay would be entirely different. He uses sentences such as “Ö of two hundred degrees, deteriorating brain, birds would pick me up clean and drop from heatstroke,” which make me want to read further to see if he will be okay by the end of his journey. I know the feeling of low fluids because I have chronic dehydration. I couldn’t imagine biking and only seeing desert hiss and passing tumbleweed; it sounds like an awful experience. If he were somewhere cooler and more colorful, his experience wouldn't have been so horrific, creating a stark contrast to the harsh realities he faces in his current environment and highlighting the life-or-death stakes of his journey.
112	6090	3	3	There are many ways that the setting affected the cyclist. One way is in the story when it says that it was very hot, he could become dehydrated and could possibly have a heat stroke, also the roads were windy. This could be a problem because he's tired, so he might not be able to go around the turns; he might just keep going straight and then get lost even more. Therefore, the challenging environmental conditions significantly impede the cyclist's progress and increase his risk of physical harm and disorientation. That is all about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story.
113	6091	3	3	"The features in the setting of ""Rough Road ahead"" affect the cyclist. First of all, the weather causes most of his problems. Since the cyclist was biking in a California desert in June the temperature had to be in the 100's. This causes him to become dehydrated, which is evident when he states, ""I had been hitting my water bottles quite regularly."" The heat, therefore, causes the cyclist to drink excessively and run out of water. Also, the objects the cyclist comes across on his journey affect him. For example, while riding on a rough path, ""a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This impedes the biker's progress and most likely scared him. The cyclist is greatly affected by the features in the story's setting."
114	6092	3	3	The cyclist was affected by the heat. The fact was June, he's in the desert and low on water, which almost lead to his downfall. This hot desert setting sounds hostile and I'm surprised he lived and that he was that lucky to pull through in those harsh conditions.
115	6093	3	3	The features of the setting had misled the cyclist. When he had first left the town where the old men adviced him, the cyclist had high hopes as it looked easy and the scenery he enjoyed seeing took away much of the struggle.
116	6094	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a large way. He has a hard time going on his journey. He began to lose hope, get tired, and began to think he was going to die. The setting played the biggest role. It was very hot with no people or buildings around him, only an endless stretch of desolate road. He had very little water and no place to get anymore, intensifying his physical distress. He then encountered a large snake which made it worse because he was in fear with no one around to help. If he would have followed his own directions instead of the old men he would not have had this problem. The setting around him really made his trip a hard one with no water, people, towns, or buildings around him, contributing to his despair and highlighting the crucial impact of environment on his ill-fated journey.
117	6095	3	3	"The features of the setting in the essay, ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î greatly affected the cyclist. In the beginning of this manís journey he was confident in his abilities. ìI rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.î The cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the setting supported this feeling. ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" As the setting began to change and his water ran out, the cyclist's attitude changed. He was ìtraveling through the high deserts of California in Juneî without much water and begun to feel desperate. As more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair. ìAt some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake - it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.î The unforgiving terrain and isolation intensified his fear. He was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this setting he lost hope of surviving. He thought he was going to die of heat stroke, not having any water left, on these short rolling hills and under the extremely hot sun. Ultimately, after enduring the harsh environment, he found his way back to civilization. The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting, going from confidence, to desperation and despair, and then to relief, the changes in setting caused his change in attitude throughout this journey."
118	6096	3	3	"The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” affect the cyclist in major ways. First, when the cyclist sees the grape juice factory, he is reminded that he is out of water and is doubtful about even living. The text states, “A young man pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head ” (Kurmaskie). This image intensifies his thirst and despair. The text later states, "" At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path..."" (Kurmaskie). This further emphasizes the desolation of the landscape. This tells that the cyclist feels depressed and is majorly affected by these sights, leading to a sense of hopelessness. These environmental cues contribute to a downward spiral, impacting his morale and making the already challenging journey feel even more insurmountable."
119	6097	3	3	The cyclist went on a rough journey and he was explaining how tiring it was and difficult it was for him going from town to town, having to deal with the lack of water, poisonous snakes, and the condition of the road. He described the relentless sun beating down, making each mile a struggle, and the constant worry of dehydration, forcing him to ration his dwindling water supply carefully. The ever-present threat of rattlesnakes slithering across his path added to the anxiety, while the pot-holed and uneven road surfaces made even maintaining balance a challenge. His journey was testing his limits.
120	6098	3	3	The setting of the essay didn’t really help the author at all on his journey. There were not many structures on the way. Either that, or the towns said to be, “a ghost town.” This couldn’t have reassured the author that things were going his way. It also was very hot during his journey. The author says he is “traveling through the deserts of California in June.” Deserts are very hot places and June is during summer which is the hottest month so it had to have been extremely hot and humid. This must have taken a toll because he never really saw anything reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait store. The desolate environment offered little comfort and likely amplified any feelings of isolation or uncertainty he may have been experiencing. So the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels.
121	6099	3	3	The features that set the affect of the cyclist is very clear in case of this essay which resounded when it observed the signs that said “Rough Road ahead: Do not Exceed posted Speed Limit.” That forced him to slow down his bike. Then he said that there were no buildings or cars anywhere. The cyclist's reaction to the road signs emphasizes the isolation and challenges he faced.
122	6100	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the essay, it states, ìThis place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the tradition of a ghost town.î This statement might affect the cyclist in the way that they fear if they get into any trouble there is no one around to help out, increasing their sense of vulnerability. This statement can also mean that they fear that they are going the wrong way, fueling uncertainty about their chosen path. In the essay, it states, ìOne ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral they couldnít had in the larger mule greeted me.î This statement simply gives the cyclist the impression that this particular town is desolate, and that nobody has even been known to live here in years, maybe decades. The bleak imagery reinforces the feeling of isolation. The different features of the journey of the cyclist in the essay, many would fear the outcome, if they over fear the journey and turned ìold timersî who had never left their porches, in order to experience such things. Ultimately, the setting's desolate and abandoned nature shapes the cyclist's experience, influencing their fears and perceptions of the journey ahead.
123	6101	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because, forty miles into the desert, I arrived at the first town. The setting of the desert affected the cyclist because the cyclist was arising down the road when the men with the settings came and affected the cyclist. The man was very crazy. Her water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and he felt that he should drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who were better off in their homes than trying to tough it out. This illustrates how the harsh desert environment and unexpected encounters ultimately impacted the cyclist's challenging journey.
124	6102	3	3	"The cyclist trusted a man that didn`t know much about the world, he thought that the guy would know how to get to the place he was looking for. The cyclist took his advice, foolishly believing he'd arrive soon, so he started to drink his water really fast. He realized that he was out of water and the park he was going to wasn't anywhere near. The cyclist got frustrated and angry; he was now crossing the desert, which was making him tired and dehydrated. He passed this road that was a rough road with tumbleweeds and snakes, he kept on going until he saw the ""CAPS1 Juice"" company. He hurried there, went into the bathroom, and drank some water. When he got out, an old man asked if he needed directions; the cyclist, now wary of bad advice, said no, trusting his own instincts from then on."
125	6103	3	3	"During the passage ìDo not exceed speed limitî, the cyclist endures many hardships. One of those countless hardships was the setting that he was in. While he was lost, thirsty, and exhausted, he remained all the while in ìThe high deserts of California in Juneî. This shows that the temperature must have been unbearable. This would cause the cyclist to tire out and dehydrate faster than usual, especially under the relentless sun. Also, the surface he was riding on had many steep hills, as it is said when he says ìover one long, crippling hill,î This shows that the hills took a lot of energy to get up, further draining his limited reserves. And finally, the author says that ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" This shows that if he needed help, there was no one around to lend him a hand, leaving him completely isolated and vulnerable. That is how the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way, compounding his already difficult situation."
126	6104	3	3	It affects the cyclist because in the beginning it talks about the old man. It also talks about basically saying their information is out of date, also in other words should have just followed his map in the first place, leading the cyclist astray by relying on faulty directions, demonstrating the old man's wisdom and the cyclist's error in judgment.
127	6105	3	3	"In the stories, don’t exceed posted speed limit, there are some very descriptive settings. In the stories these settings have a great effect on the cyclist. Through these our settings the effects change. Some good effects some harsh effects. The first setting that is described do you is, ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" This setting gives you a vivid picture of were the cyclist is heading. This setting also establishes a happy sort of mood, suggesting a refreshing and invigorating ride ahead. But the pretty picture is about to change. Not so much further in to the cyclist ride he noticed a change of terrain,"" flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 The cyclist is short on water, and is becoming very tyered. Seeing this just crushes his spirit. @CAPS1 Riding hills hard is one thing, but ridding hills with our knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills is another. Both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. The first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride, filled with scenic beauty and ease. But this all changes when he hit those horrible hills. Just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills, makes your legs hurt. Over all the features of the setting imposed an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward by beautiful place, creating a narrative arc of challenge and eventual triumph."
128	6106	3	3	The author had to bike through extremely hot weather. This made him sweat a lot. Wide rings of dried sweat circled his shirt. The heat was relentless. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. He then had to suck on pebbles, desperate for any moisture, which presented a choking hazard. With any luck he’d hit a bump and lodge one in his throat, ending his misery, though this was a grim thought considering his situation. The desperation for hydration was evident, leading to risky actions.
129	6107	3	3	In the story ìDo Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limitî there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. The most challenging problem faced by the author was the lack of water. ì I pumped that handle for several minutes but the water wouldnít calm down nor I tried a drip or two,it had the flaver of beatterly acid.When @CAPS2 set out for the next train @CAPS2 came to a road that read ìRough road ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. The tarrain got more bumpy & hard to cross. The effected the determination the cyclist had left @CAPS2 the regreted not listening to the old men of didnít think they knew what they were talking about. Due to the fact they never left their porches. The cyclist now faced the consequences of ignoring their wisdom regarding the local conditions. As you can see the setting most deffinated effected the cyclist in physical or mental ways.
130	6108	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One way it affects the cyclist is by being hot, like it says in the text ""I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June."" This suggests the weather could pose a threat to the cyclist's health and performance, potentially causing exhaustion. Another way it affects the cyclist is by being bumpy, as indicated by the sign ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT."" This implies that the road conditions could impact the cyclist's speed and control, necessitating caution and affecting their overall journey. Thus, the setting significantly influences the cyclist's experience, impacting both their physical well-being and their ability to navigate the terrain."
131	6109	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by influencing his mood and what happens as he journeys in the desert to a town. For example, his mood changes when the old man asks him for a map, and his attitude shifts, marked by cautiousness of the new road he takes. This cautiousness then escalates to terror when he thinks, ""I was gonna die and the birds would pick me clean!"" Later, his attitude transforms to pride when the old man asks for a map, and the author says, ""I own a very good map."" But as he journeys, the setting changes from a desert-type place to a bait shop, where he pauses to rest, likely then continuing on his way toward Yosemite. Ultimately, the contrasting settings – the harsh desert and the welcoming bait shop – shape not only the cyclist's journey but also his evolving emotional state."
132	6110	3	3	'Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limití by Joe Kurmaskie demonstrated that the features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. First off, the cyclist was in the desert on a bicycle. This affected her because if they had been in a car, or on a bus alot less energy would have been used up, as cycling demanded significant physical exertion under the scorching sun. Secondly, the cyclist started running out of water. This setting didnít help because they were on a bike so that kept them hydrated. Another setting that affected the plot was the deserted towns. If they hadnít been deserted everything would have been better, providing opportunities to resupply and seek assistance. These features affected the cyclist a great deal, shaping her struggles and ultimately influencing the narrative's outcome.
133	6111	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cycles such that it was affecting his determination to continue. For example, after @NUM1 miles he looked upon the ramshackled shed, several rusty pumps, and the corral. This sight troubled him. In the desert his water tasted like the flavor of battery acid. It also goes on to say that it was a ""test for my inner spirit."" It also states that he went along with a few drops of water through the tumbleweeds, enduring the arid landscape. This passage shows obstacles he had to go through in which he did overcome, emerging with a little confidence. Although his situation was somewhat unbearable, characterized by thirst and desolate surroundings, he still kept striving on, highlighting his resilience in the face of adversity."
134	6112	3	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in most of the story. The heat made him hot & thirsty while the travel gave him a lack of energy and even a heightened sense of a need for water. In paragraph 1 the writer says one of the hills was ìlong and arduous.î The hill was wearing him out & draining what was left of his energy. The setting of the story was the biggest party if the road was flat and bumpy while the temperature was scorching. The harsh environment significantly impacted the cyclist's physical state, highlighting how setting can be a major influencing factor in a narrative.
135	6113	3	3	The setting easily can affect the cyclist in many ways. The area in which the cyclist was in seemed to be abandoned which doesn't give a well thinking to this person. If a town was abandoned or a road was, automatically then won't be any noticeable building structures for a while. Also, the land and shape of the road seemed to be very dangerous for the cyclist not only because of the narrow and rocky path but because of the wildlife. In the text, it says how a diamond back snake, poisonous was directly in front of the cyclist. That example explains on how the wildlife might exceed to more dangerous creatures. Finally, the temperature, whether it was hot or cold, the cyclist was limited to water & being completely dehydrated was a huge caution for the cyclist, especially considering the physical exertion required for cycling. The conditions of the setting the cyclist was in became a disadvantage for him, highlighting the significant impact of environment on his well-being and safety.
136	6114	3	3	The different settings that the cyclist had to **navigate** were mountains or hills, winding roads, and the California desert in June. As well as, he was running out of water.
137	6115	3	3	How the features of the setting affect the cyclist depends greatly on whether or not the setting is appropriate. If the features are just not right, and they could be changed around a little bit and still convey the essay's meaning, then those features should be modified. The wrong setting could negatively impact the cyclist's performance and overall experience, while a more suitable setting would be beneficial. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the setting and its impact on the cyclist, adjusting it to best suit the purpose of the essay.
138	6116	3	3	"The features of the setting have an affect on the cyclist. He is going on this bike ride through the deserts of California in June. This obviously is going to have an affect on him because it will be very hot. At one point he says, ""The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed."" Also, the setting of having all these ghost towns was troubling to him because no one else was around and he was beginning to run out of water. The weather outside was starting to get to him, and he said, ""I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage…"" When you're pedaling through the desert on a hot day it is going to have effects on you. If he was in a different setting this feeling of despair would not be in the story. That is how the setting affects the cyclist."
139	6117	3	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature is the weather. When a cyclist is on a trip the weather could affect the setting greatly. An example, if it started to rain the roads could become very slippery and dangerous to ride your bike on. The cyclist and his bike could crash and be injured. Just cause of the weather. Another feature is the animals. An animal is important cause any were you do the are different animals that do different things. If the cyclist knows the animals around the area that he is traveling he could keep safe and not be harmed, knowing which animals to avoid. Itís better to know the area and feel safe. Then not knowing whatís going to happen next, and being prepared allows the cyclist to have a better experience.
140	6118	3	3	As the features changed in the setting it becomes harder for the cyclist. At first, the cyclist started off pretty easy. He had flat, smooth roads to go through. He started out before the sun could get to him. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it. He kept his mind off the sun, and this helped him. Then, he got to a highway that made it kind of harder. I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. So he had to pedal harder and would tire him faster. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path. Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. By the tumbleweeds that means he was in the desert during a hot period of time. So he had little water left and he was becoming dehydrated, making his progress even more challenging. This was a hard task for him to overcome. By the terrain changing it became harder for him, showing how the environment increasingly tested his endurance.
141	6119	3	3	The setting in this short story ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî is a hot, sunny desert, in which all towns have been abandoned, ìThe sun was beginning to beat downî and the heat radiated off the cracked asphalt. ì i arrived at the first town it fit the defination of a ghost town, dust devils swirling through empty streets. (@NUM1) trational. The cyclist at this point is not only parched, but tired and worried about the lack of water; his lips were cracked, and his energy flagged with each rotation of the pedals. The setting and cyclistís state run side by side, the desolation of the landscape mirroring his dwindling hope, thus enhancing the story's tension.
142	6120	3	3	In the story there are many affects the cyclist deals with. He has to go through a lot of bad things just to finish. The cyclist has to watch out for a rough road he was going over, with loose gravel and unexpected potholes threatening to throw him off balance. Also the whole time he was racing he had to watch out for diamond back snackes, slithering across the path, a constant source of danger. Also the whole race, the cyclist biggest problem was water. He ran out quickly, his throat parched under the scorching sun. And when he saw the factory and stopped, desperation clawing at him. He put rocks in his mouth to make him forget about water, and lets yours split circulate, a desperate attempt to stimulate saliva and alleviate his thirst. The cyclist had to go through all these problems which made it show that he had determination, pushing through pain and hardship to reach the finish line.
143	6121	3	3	The features of the setting greatly effected the cyclist. He was riding along on a route he had little confidence would end up anywhere. That being the first time ever being on that rode and having only not of date knowledge about it made the cyclist rework. The temperature was very hot, where was little shade, the sun was beating down on him. The route was very discouraging. All the cyclist wanted was water and the route kept touenting him with false hope. At the first town he noticed a water pump, but all he could get of it was sludge and water that tasted like battery acid. Next he came to a deserted old building that approved to be an old bottling factory for Welchís grape juice. The cyclist would appear to be closing in on something to drink, but be left with nothing. The arid landscape, combined with the mirage-like promise of refreshment, amplified his thirst and fatigue. Ultimately, the harsh environment seemed determined to break his spirit.
144	6122	3	3	During the cyclist's bike ride, the unbearable conditions changed his attitude. When he first starts, the reader can sense frustration because of the old timers and their directions, which seemed outdated and unhelpful. Then, as he realizes that he might have enough water to actually complete the journey, his attitude changes noticeably. The cyclist goes from frustrated to loving the scenery; “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,” reflecting a newfound appreciation for his surroundings. But as the conditions changed to even more unbearable heat and the physical strain increased, he decided to just give up, the initial optimism fading. Until he got courage and started “slowly gaining elevation while losing hope,” pushing himself forward despite the despair. When he saw Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, a beacon of civilization in the wilderness, he realized he was safe, his journey nearing its end. The cyclist's attitude, therefore, shifted dramatically based on the changing circumstances, ultimately demonstrating resilience.
145	6123	3	3	The bicyclist from “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” was affected in many ways by the environment. The most talked about feature in the environment was the lack of water. The bicyclist was going to die because there was no water and he was really dehydrated. Another feature was the heat. It was really hot where the narrator was bicycling. When it is hot, the heat dehydrates you. So the narrator was being pushed to the limit because of the heat. Also, everyone was gone from the towns so every town he came to was haunting him until he got mad at the lodgers he talked to and was really frustrated. The smooth flat road gave way to rolling hills, which made it harder for him to ride. Lastly, the snake in the road affected him because he had to avoid it, adding a moment of startling fear and physical exertion. All of these environmental challenges significantly affected his physical and mental state, compounding his struggle for survival.
146	6124	3	3	ìDo not exceed posted speed limitî by Joe Kurmaskie is truly a story of man against nature. Here is a man who is completely alone except for his bike, the baron landscape and relentless sun. First he notices the sun, over head him, expected from California June, but not none the less. Then next come the rolling hills and incline in elevation, going up hill means his body working, harder, and burning calories and his much needed water supply. Then there is the man much torture. A speed limit of @NUM1,were he is going a tough 12. And worse a billboard of ìa young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,î this truly hit his emotions, showing him exactly what it was out of reach. In this story every element of his surrounding contributed to his hoplessness, proving how even the simplest aspects of nature and civilization can become formidable adversaries when one is pushed to their physical and emotional limits.
147	6125	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by the awful road conditions making it difficult to maintain balance. The cyclist also mentioned a large snake obstructing his way, along with the periodic tumbleweeds, adding to the challenges. The most significant impact on the cyclist, however, was the extreme heat combined with a lack of water, further compounding his exhaustion. These elements of the environment clearly made the journey incredibly tough for the cyclist.
148	6126	3	3	"If I had a choice to ride a bike in California or Vermont, it would be a no-brainer to bike in Vermont. The temperature in Vermont would be much cooler than in California. In the story the cyclist complains about the ""wide rings of dried sweat"" and the possibility of heatstroke. It is proven that when temperatures rise, you tend to lose more water from your body. Had the cyclist gone to a cooler site at a different time of year he wouldn't have struggled with dehydration on his bike ride, finding the experience far more pleasant and safe."
149	6127	3	3	"The features of the setting in the story affected the cyclist a lot. In the morning when he began his trip, he was eager and determined to get to his destination. Although it took him forty miles to get to the first ""town,"" he didn't seem to mind. ""The cool pires and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,"" is what crossed his mind once the sun began to beat down. Meaning that he didn't mind or wasn't troubled by it at the time. But the farther his trip went, the hotter it got, and the less water supply he had left, amplifying the impact of the harsh environment. Once he passed a couple of ""troubling sights,"" because they were abandoned and no one was around, he began to worry. The cyclist got to the point that he started to suck on pebbles, in order to circulate the last spit he had in his mouth. In his desperation he finally saw a sign for hope that gave him strength in order to continue on. When he arrived at GARY AND @CAPS1'S FISH CAMP, his emotions, and mind changed from being lugubrious, to becoming thankful, highlighting how the setting's transition from desolate to hospitable directly influenced his emotional state."
150	6128	3	3	During his cycling trip, the author had to endure extreme heat, face snakes, deal with little or no shade and survive a dire lack of water, all problems related to the setting of Yosemite National Park. The author, cyclist Joe Kurmaskie, writes of becoming dehydrated, and describes, ìthe sun was beginning to beat down and l was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.î A struggle for him was crossing the path of a ìridiculously large snakeî and ìtrying to keep his balance in his dehydrates state. Kurmaskie ran out of water, due to the extreme heat, and upon reaching a water pump, finds the water to be unfit for drinking and ìin the neighborhood of zoo degrees.î Another setting-related issue for Kurmaskie was the fact the area seemed deserted and he had to continue for miles until he was able to find a spot with clean water where he could rest and rehydrate. These environmental challenges within Yosemite significantly impacted Kurmaskie's journey, highlighting the harsh realities of navigating such a landscape.
151	6129	3	3	The features of the setting were very affective in the story “Speed Limit.” It affected the cyclist because in one part of the setting it went to rolling hills. That’s going to be hard to pedal a bike on, and it will require more energy. Another way the setting affected the cyclist is at one point tumbleweeds were in his way. If he gets caught on the bike it could have caused him to fall and it could harm him. Lastly, the road started getting rough up ahead which could be hard to ride over potholes and things like that. Therefore, the setting was affecting to the cyclist, creating challenges and potential dangers for him.
152	6130	3	3	The features of the setting keep affecting the cyclist because first it's hopeful, then he realizes it's hopeless. He was laughing when people told him the right directions, and now “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had energy to feel bad for myself,” said the cyclist when he was referring back to the first town and his dwindling water supply. The reason this affects the cyclist is at first he was going good, then he got thirsty and bad things happened, including his loss of optimism. Ultimately, the harshness of the environment directly impacts his emotional state, swinging him from joy to despair, highlighting the setting's power over his journey.
153	6131	3	3	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" written by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the author in many ways. One feature was the hills. The speed limit affected the author because he felt that he was moving too slow. In the story when it says ""I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph,"" is evidence of this. This demonstrates how the speed limit, combined with the challenging terrain, frustrated Kurmaskie, making him feel like his progress was painstakingly slow. Ultimately, the restrictive speed limit and the demanding hills created a sense of confinement and tested his patience throughout his journey."
154	6132	3	3	This is how the setting effects the cyclist. One is the hot dry California desert heat. It was making him hot and thirsty which was making him low on water. The hot desert heat had made water a mirage-like substance which he could not drink from the well. The water bottle only contained a few tantalizing sips which was not enough to quench his thirst. The oppressive heat that would make buzzards pick him dry, all of those examples make it hard for the reader to take the old timers advice. It made him realize that in time comes wisdom and youth can make silly mistakes. The heat had made it only a trip for his inner soul to survive. That is how the setting effects the cyclist.
155	6133	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist mainly because he was in a desert. There were no stores, no rivers or lakes, it was very hot, the roads were long and there were even snakes on the road. It made it harder for him because he didn’t have much water to drink, making the journey treacherous and significantly increasing his risk of dehydration and exhaustion in the harsh environment.
156	6134	3	3	Many features in the setting affect the cyclist. Several main features include the cars lading town that aint really towns anymore, and the water pump. Both of these examples gave him hope but none gave him relief. The town he first saw could give him water, but it was all run down and weakened. ìI arrived at the first ìtownî. This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time... refer the @NUM1 word war.î He is saying that the town couldíve given him more water and enery, but it appeared that it was over for this town. Additionally, he biked across a water pump that was well needed. He tried to pump water but got no success. ìI pumped the handle for several minutes but the water wouldnít cool down.î A working water pump wouldíve been huge for him giving him more strength to bike. However, once again it was very misleading, as the cyclist's environment continuously presented the illusion of aid without actually providing any tangible assistance.
157	6135	3	3	This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is ìflat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î That changes the effect because by saying that it will show how tired he is going to be or the work trying to make it over the hills. The cyclist will have to expend more energy navigating the varied terrain. Another example would be ìhigh deserts of California in June.î Thatís saying its hot outside and very tiring. I think it means that because in California its really hot and in June the ìsummer timeî its very tiring. The heat will likely lead to dehydration and exhaustion. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The environment presents challenges that will test the cyclist's endurance.
158	6136	3	3	The features affect the cyclist because of how the road is made. If the road is a downhill ride the cyclist might ride faster. The road might be up the hill so he might go slow. There could be a possibility that the road might have bump rocks or grass on it that could be something tough to ride through. So the affect of the cyclist is depending on how the roads are made, and ultimately determines the cyclist's speed and ease of travel.
159	6137	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the worse the features get the more he wants water. For example, in the essay it said at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me; when I think of tumbleweeds I think of dryness because it is like dry grass, and when I think of snakes I think of heat because that is the time for snakes to come out when it gets hot. So, the cyclist was thinking about the dryness of his throat and the dryness of his surroundings, making him want water. He likely felt increasingly parched as these arid elements dominated his view. Another feature is when he saw a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth, probably making the cyclist wish he could have that cold, refreshing drink. Seeing such an image in his dehydrated state would only amplify his longing for hydration. Therefore, the harsh environment and evocative imagery directly intensified the cyclist's thirst and desire for water.
160	6138	3	3	In ìRough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî the cyclist was affected by the features of the setting. She was first affected by the old men who told her a ìshortcutî to her ride to Yosemite National Park, leading her astray. Then she was affected by a ghost town which had no water to give her, increasing her thirst. She was almost dehydrated when she came to a rickety road which had a few tumbleweeds and a huge snake which was quite difficult to get by, further slowing her progress and depleting her energy. Then at the end she came upon ìGary and Wilberís fish campî where she decided to make decisions herself. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way except ìGary and Wilberís fish campî, which saved her from dehydration and allowed her to regain control of her journey.
161	6139	3	3	In the short story, “Rough Road Ahead,” the cyclist faced with many problems. One of these is the feature of setting. I believe it has a big affect. The setting is in a desert, which is very hot, there is no water around and usually nobody lives in a desert. One thing is that he was running out of water. In the text it says, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” The setting of the book that affects the cyclist is that it is in June. June is a very hot month, especially when the cyclist is in a desert traveling many miles, further exacerbating his dehydration and struggle for survival. Therefore, the harsh desert environment in June significantly contributes to the cyclist's challenges.
162	6140	3	3	The settings of cyclist affects the way cyclist perform. If the weather is too hot then the cyclist might slow down because of the sun beating down on them. If its too cold, the cyclist puts on more clothes which might weigh them down from achieving the speed they need to obtain. The bike has to be stable, with proper tire inflation ensuring good contact with the road. Riding on rough roads, frequent braking, and pushing for top speed all impact performance, as do chains being in good condition, properly lubricated for smooth gear changes. The area were the cyclists rides sets the mood. If its a nice scenary the cyclist might be in a wonderful mood as to the scenary being dark and gloomy with nasty weather behind it the cyclist might not be as happy as they could be, potentially affecting their focus and motivation. These typess of things @MONTH1 help determine how settings can affect the cyclist, ultimately demonstrating how crucial environmental and equipment factors are to a cyclist's success.
163	6141	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Aheadî the setting greatly affects the cyclists. The arid desert climate burrows down upon the cyclist. For example the farther route, he takes is not only arid, but also has no place to get water. The heat and lack of water combine for deadly dehydration upon the cyclists. The setting now forces the cyclist to become more determined if he wants to live. He must continue and pray for a town to come up, so he can restock on water and become hydrated once again, showing how the environment's harshness truly tests the cyclist's resolve.
164	6142	3	3	Many different things affected his way to Yosemite National Park, but the environment he was in played the biggest role in his journey. The cyclist was in a dry, desert area where tumble weeds were more common than people. The sun beat down relentlessly on the cracked earth. When the cyclist came across the old men and asked them for directions, they led him to a ìghost townî there was no water for the dehydrated cyclist who had been baking in the extremely dry, hot weather. His lips were parched and cracked. This caused a problem where the cyclist thought that he would die in the desert because of the weather, directions he was given, and lack of water. The heat shimmered off the sand. When the cyclist come across the bait shop he know he was saved. He became rehydrated and declined directions from an old man because these features of the setting are what caused his problems in the first place: old men, dry weather, and water. Ultimately, the harsh desert environment proved to be the most significant factor shaping the cyclist's arduous journey.
165	6143	3	3	"There are a couple of things that affect the cyclist in the story. One of the ways he is affected is dehydration, as ""the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June."" A positive aspect for the cyclist was the solitude, with no one in sight to impede his progress on the bike ride. Conversely, a negative consequence arose from poor advice, as ""don't ask direction from a guy from heat strokes on a gorgeous day in June simply because listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been left their porch in decade, caused me to laugh."" Furthermore, the natural environment presented obstacles, including ""tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake--It really did look like a diamond back.. Blocked the major of the parement in front of me,"" further complicating the cyclist's journey. These combined factors of physical discomfort, navigational errors, and environmental challenges clearly shaped the cyclist's experience."
166	6144	3	3	The cyclist, knowing not where he was going, got wrong information and he followed it. He was excited to know that he knew where he was heading too. Along his journey he was affected by a lot of things like the sun, the weather condition of their location, and the big snake he saw. He was affected by the sun because he was dehydrating and he almost had no water left, as it was also becoming so hot, alike making the journey very difficult for him and made his mood strange while also following the direction he was misguided. Disturbed by a big snake he encountered at the crossing, he was scared that he was going to be attacked, making him uneasy as he tried to make his way through. These features affected him because he didn’t know where he was going and he wasn't prepared. He was going in the wrong direction, and he wasn’t prepared for the journey because the weather condition was summer time and it was hot, and he was riding a bicycle, not a car. All this made the journey more challenging and contributed to his disorientation.
167	6145	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist with his train of thought. On page @NUM1 it says, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" This gives a sense of heat and foreshadows maybe the lack of water he’ll have later on. As he passes a snake, ""trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" So the cyclist is most likely beginning to feel dizzy and begins to lose hope. On page @NUM2 he says, ""…I could drop from heatstroke…"" meaning he’s starting to think of the worst possible things that could happen, affecting him as he begins to lose hope and thinks he’s not going to make it. On page @NUM3, he says, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean…"" By this point the conditions he was having were rough and making him worry, demonstrating how the harsh setting significantly impacted the cyclist's mental state, leading to feelings of despair. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist throughout the story."
168	6146	3	3	"With little water the setting was not helpful to the cyclist. Joe @PERSON1 said, ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kindî (@PERSON1). After receiving bad directions from a few old men having people passing by in cars or nearby stores would probably help the cyclist for asking directions. @PERSON1 said, ""working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength"" (@PERSON1). Having no water to replenish your body will make you weak and unstable. In the middle of nowhere that is a problem. @PERSON1 also said, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hillsî (@PERSON1). With little water left and a weak body it must have been hard going up and down those hills. @PERSON1 also said, ìI was traveling through the high deserts of California in Juneî (@PERSON1). Dust in your lungs and heat from the sun makes it even harder for your body to work. The lack of water in the Californian desert during the hot month of June created a very difficult and potentially dangerous situation for the cyclist."
169	6147	3	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist. The setting takes place in June. It is very hot and the cyclist is getting very dehydrated. You can imagine how hot it got when it said, ìwiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnít a mirage.î It also sounded in the story that it felt like two hundred degrees when the sun was beating down. The heat clearly made the cyclist question their perception, highlighting the harsh impact of the environment on their physical and mental state, which shows how the weather impacted the cyclist negatively.
170	6148	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. For example it was June and he was in the deserts of California. It was very hot and dehydrated him. Also he did not know where he was going so he had to rely on other people's directions. Also he had to keep hydrating. That is what affected the cyclist, showing how the environment played a significant role in his journey.
171	6149	3	3	The features of the settings in ìDo not exceed the posted speed limitî by Joe Kurmaskie were rough and challenging. A biker rides through Todi, California which is a rough area to ride. The ride was hot and long that he was so dehydrated that sweat was dried around his neck. The solo cyclist says ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.î He had nowhere to get water or food; it was deserted. He thought if he died no one would find him faster than the birds would pick him clean. The essay ìrough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit by @PERSON1 shows a solo cyclist's journey and the independence required to face such harsh conditions, highlighting the mental fortitude needed to overcome isolation and physical hardship.
172	6150	3	3	In the story, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faced many obstacles. For example, he had to get directions to Yosemite National Park, but the directions were from elder men, whose information was out of date. In addition, the cyclist had to decide which way to take when there was a fork in the road, unsure if either path was correct. He chose a path the old men said would have a town nearly eighteen miles down the road. Furthermore, the cyclist ran into flat roads that went to rolling hills, snakes blocking his path forcing detours, and a dehydration state that couldíve killed him had he not found water. In conclusion, this man overcame obstacles to get to Yosemite National Park.
173	6151	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affects the cyclist in various different ways. First of all he listened to the old man so he was on the wrong path. So he travels and itís a hot June day in California deserts. The odds are against him from the start ìThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I needed a drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in JuneÖî(Kurmaskie @NUM1) From the angle you can tell that he's tired and almost out of water. The relentless sun and arid landscape of the California desert are actively working against him, pushing him to his physical and mental limits. It puts a lot of strain on the cyclist but he manages. Ultimately, the harsh setting is a significant obstacle that he must overcome.
174	6152	3	3	"The setting clearly has a huge effect on the cyclist. The flat roads are easy and smooth to ride on, but as the road changes to short, rolling hills, the biking becomes more difficult. This is supported by the sentence that reads, ""Over are long, crippling hill...î This shows that the hill is a very challenging obstacle. He is also effected by the things that come with the change in terrain. For example, one sentence reads ""...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondbuck-blooked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This stresses how remote the area in which he is biking really is, and shows how it mentally and physically effects his trip, as the environment presents unexpected physical challenges and potential dangers that demand constant vigilance and affect his overall experience."
175	6153	3	3	The affect of the setting are two old timers sitting on their front porch out in the desert since Carter was in office. It was starting to become daylight, painting the cacti in soft hues, and he had to walk @NUM1 miles to get to the next town. So he gets on a rusty, old bike and rides to the next town. The speed limit is 55 miles per hour and he was going 12 miles per hour, the pace dictated by the gentle waterflow in the nearby irrigation ditch. He was riding up and down rolling hills, the sun climbing higher, promising another scorching day. He finally got to the next town to live, hoping for a fresh start in the quiet desert community.
176	6154	3	3	The setting of the essay affects the cyclist because he got lost; when he asked for directions from some old people along the route, their guidance, while well-intentioned, proved unreliable. Consequently, the cyclist found himself disoriented, highlighting how the specific location and the residents encountered directly contributed to his predicament.
177	6155	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a lot of ways. In the essay, the author describes how the setting is hot and bumpy, causing him to sweat profusely and become increasingly tired. He is also running out of water due to his intense thirst. The road gets very rocky at one point, further complicating his journey. The narrator states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1), highlighting the changing and challenging terrain. There is also a photograph that visually reinforces how rough and barren the landscape is, with nothing around to offer respite. Ultimately, the demanding setting significantly contributes to the cyclist's physical and mental exhaustion."
178	6156	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is dehydrated and has to ride on a horrible road with snakes and hills. All of these features act like obstacles, making it hard to receive water. Also, with the cyclist being hot and in need of water, he is at this point delirious and most likely doesn’t know what's going on. In the story, the author's main feature of the setting is the road: “Rough road ahead.” This explains the cyclist having to go on a rough road, and doing that dehydrated is very dangerous; these are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist and ultimately hinder his progress.
179	6157	3	3	"The setting has a huge effect on the cyclist. When he first comes to the town, he isn’t really worried; he is kind of laughing and thinks he is funny by saying, ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time - say, before the last world war."" Then after he says that, it says he chuckled. When he gets to the dark in the road with the risky pipe of water, he begins to switch into conservation mode and begins to get scared. He says, ""I would comer water- a test at my inner spirit,"" showing that he was scared of the uncertainty. After he sees the abandoned grape juice factory, he says something like birds are going to pick him clean and leave behind some expensive biking gear. This definitely shows that he is giving up hope. Another thing that would back this up is when he talks about writing in his diary about the old men who give him these directions. When he finally reaches the bait shop, he is relieved and goes to the bathroom and drinks water. He also says that he will buy bait even though he doesn’t have a rod. These examples clearly demonstrate the many ways the setting affected the cyclist's mood and perception, transforming him from amused to fearful and ultimately relieved."
180	6158	3	3	"In the story, ""Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the features of the setting affect the cyclist. To keep cool on a hot summer day, it might be necessary for one to find shade. Just to add to the misfortune of the story, there was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. This factor does not help the cyclist at all; in fact, all it does is make the cyclist more exhausted because there is no shelter from the sun's rays. Another element in the story that affects the cyclist is the lack of water. Early on in the story, the author explains, ""The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips."" With more miles to go, the cyclist starts to lose hope of making it to his destination alive due to dehydration. The feature of rolling hills also affects the cyclist. The cyclist is already tired enough, and just to add to his misfortune, ""flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills."" Though the hills are short, they still could have put an impact on him because of the repetitive nature of the hills. Many features of the story affected the mood of the story, contributing to a sense of despair and highlighting the cyclist's struggle against the harsh environment."
181	6159	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. It affected him because the sign said @NUM1 miles to the first town, leading him to believe he was almost there and moving at a good pace. But when the cyclist got to the first town, he felt discouraged because it looked deserted. As he continued, he began to realize he wasn't making progress as quickly as he thought. He then realized he had relied on advice from locals who hadn't even ventured beyond their porches. After reaching that desolate first town, the cyclist resolved never to trust the advice of such people again, as the town appeared abandoned for years, teaching him a harsh lesson about trusting unreliable sources.
182	6160	3	3	The features of the setting on the way to Yosemite National Park, greatly affected the cyclist. On the way to the park, the cyclist had encountered the heat of the desert in California. Besides the heat the cyclist had to overcome the rough terrain of the short, rolling hills. This made the cyclist tired and weary. Adding to his weakness, and the extreme heat, he also ran out of water, causing him to become dehydrated. ìWide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke...laugh.î The sun beat down relentlessly, and each rotation of the pedals became a monumental effort. This trip through the California desert greatly affected the cyclist by causing great exhaustion and dehydration.
183	6161	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the climate could be hot, the road could be bumpy, and the town could be deserted. For example, ""Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit."" This would be hard for a cyclist who is thirsty. And if he is not and with no water he probably could barely make it up the hills. And with no town for water he would be thirsty. First ""town"" This place might have been a thriving little spot at one point but anthor warning it fit the outsides of ghost town"" No water. The relentless sun beating down would only worsen his dehydration as he struggled against the uneven terrain. Ultimately, the harsh environment, with its challenging roads and lack of resources, would severely impact the cyclist's ability to continue."
184	6162	3	3	Hot, lack of water, lost-all are how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, it was hot. In one sentence he says the sun was beginning to beat down. Also that the water felt around two-hundred degrees. That sweat was all over him, showing how oppressive the heat was. So he had to be really hot. Next, the lack of water affected him and his performance. This was because he was dying in need of water. He tried everything to get water but made it through with almost no water, impacting his physical state. Lastly, he was lost. The map that he had was wrong and the trip wasn't what he expected, adding a layer of mental strain to his physical struggles. But in the end he was relieved. So even toward all these negative affects he still managed to come to positive. Basically this story is explaining how if you try your hardest, never give up, and try new things you are most likely to succeed in life and other things you take part of. Therefore, with perseverance and adaptability, overcoming obstacles is possible, leading to a positive outcome. So try your best and make way of your life and plans in your life.
185	6163	3	3	The conditions the cyclist has to face are always problems or helpers. Say there is a rocky up-hill part. That will most definuntly slow him down, requiring more effort to navigate the uneven terrain. But if there is a nice smooth downhill part that will speed him up, and take alot of work of pedling off his hands, offering a chance to rest and recover. Thus, the cyclist's journey is a constant negotiation with the environment.
186	6164	3	3	The cyclist lost hope because he was in the California desert in June. The cyclist started to lose hope because there was a rusty water pump that pumped out battery-acid tasting water; each sip was a struggle. When he saw the sign “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” he was very cautious, slowing down considerably. The cyclist thought for sure that he was going to die out there, under the relentless sun. The cyclist also felt lonely because in the text it says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The cyclist was in the California desert, and that isolation, coupled with the harsh conditions, made him think he was going to die out there, alone and forgotten. His dwindling water supply and the desolate landscape contributed to his despair.
187	6165	3	3	"In ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his trying biking trip through California. In the essay, he describes the weather with ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" While this June does not directly characterize the weather, the reader can confirm a clear image of the sweltering heat of a desert in the summer. When the author comes across the ""ghost town"" followed by the dilapidated shack, and finally the sign that read ""Rough Road Ahead,"" his hope of finding Yosemite Park was gone. The hopelessness of the situation made the author want to give up, thinking that he was going to die out in the desert from dehydration and exhaustion. This can be related to anyone that has been lost in unfavorable conditions, and the feeling of helplessness and fear that goes along with it. It feels like everything is against you, with nothing working in your favor, and this is what the author experiences in his description of his trip in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" illustrating the universal feeling of despair when facing seemingly insurmountable obstacles."
188	6166	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist; the exhaustion was getting to him. What made it worse was that he was out in the heat, sweating, which also caused dehydration. The relentless sun beat down, amplifying his fatigue, and with each drop of sweat lost, his strength diminished further, making his already difficult ride even more challenging.
189	6167	3	3	To begin with a feature that affect the cyclist was a lack of water this is shown when the speaker says when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid-thats was one of the biggest factors he had risked. This tainted water source highlights the harsh conditions and the lengths he had to go to in order to simply survive the journey. The risk associated with hydration underscores the extreme nature of his undertaking.
190	6168	3	3	As the reader listened and followed the directions of the old-timers he faced many issues and also learned a lesson. As he began to ride into the day break of morning he had strong legs and even a smile on his face. As time went on he soon became close to out of water and experienced a loss of energy. The hot summer day made him sweat and he began to think that the birds would pluck at his body as if he would die on his ride to Yosemite. When he finally got to a town he soon refreshed himself, and learned that he would start to follow his own way of getting to places. He realized that while advice is helpful, personal experience and intuition should also guide his journey, ensuring a more adaptable and successful trip.
191	6169	3	3	The features of the setting in the essay ìDo not exceed the posted speed limitî affected the cyclist in a negative way. The more and more he rode, he thought more negatively and had alot of doubt. The cyclist was not very confident, he thought he wouldnít make it. For example, when the cyclist notices nothing in sight, his tone changes. ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon telling myself that if I could make it that far , Iíd be fineî. He seemed unsure and a little nervous. The isolation of the setting, with its vast emptiness, clearly contributes to his anxiety. As the journey continued, the cyclist loses hope it seems. ìIt didnít really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diaryî He does not see himself finishing this journey the more and more he rides in the middle of nowhere with nothing to be seen except ìRough Road Aheadî signs. These signs, instead of being warnings, become symbols of his impending doom, furthering his despair. The bleak and desolate environment, therefore, actively undermines his resolve and fosters a sense of hopelessness that permeates his thoughts.
192	6170	3	3	The features in the setting are very effective to the cyclist. He is in a desert area of California and he has limited water supply. It is very hot and very dry. He barely had any water to drink and he had to go a long way in the hot and arid weather. The deficiency of water could have made him become dehydrated. Another obstacle that he had during this biking trip to Yosemite National Park was the hills that he faced. At the beginning, he was on flat terrain, now he has hills that he has to pedal up that makes it a lot harder for him. One other obstacle that he faced was the snake he ran into, slithering across the road. That setting had many obstacles for this guy. If it wasn't for the heat and lack of water, he might have been able to make it a little easier. Clearly, the environmental conditions presented a significant challenge to his journey.
193	6171	3	3	"The features of the setting strongly affected the cyclist. The rolling hills were the cyclist’s most challenging problem because they were long and crippling. Maneuvering down the hill would take a lot of energy and determination from the cyclist. Considering the cyclist was already tired and sweating from riding on rough roads and passing a large snake, riding on rolling hills would be extremely difficult. The rough roads had jostled him relentlessly, and the snake had startled him, costing him precious momentum. The features of the setting were not helping the cyclist stay healthy because their difficulty was causing the cyclist to become dehydrated and possibly drop from heatstroke. However, the cyclist kept a positive attitude and did not give up. His determination saved him as he felt relief when he finally came across the ""Gary and Wilbell's fish camp."" In conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because they forced him to work extra hard and put forth more effort. But with determination, you can accomplish anything!"
194	6172	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit.” The cyclist’s mood seems to change as the road and setting does. The narration states, “a large high way sign jumped out at me. I read : Rough road ahead : Do not exceed posted speed limit … sometimes life can feel so cruel” (Kurmaskie). Slowly as the terrain gets harder and harder the cyclist feels worse and worse, his initial optimism fading with each difficult mile. Every time he believes there is a town ahead, he gets happy, anticipating rest and supplies, but his dreams are soon crushed by the harsh reality of the unending road. One can see in the picture the hard cycling terrain that can affect the cyclist, making him tired due to lack of water and the sense of hopelessness he feels as he loses energy and believes he will die. This interplay between the external environment and the cyclist's internal state highlights how the setting directly contributes to the story's central theme of perseverance against overwhelming odds.
195	6173	3	3	Some features of the setting that affected the cyclist were signs that had speed limits. The sign affected the speed of the cyclist. Another feature was a hill on the route. This affected the cyclist by making him tired because he said “I wipe the sweat from my eyes.” The presence of traffic lights also likely influenced the cyclist, requiring him to stop and start, thus impacting his overall time and exertion. These various elements of the environment demonstrably shaped the cyclist's journey.
196	6174	3	3	The setting had a huge affect on the cyclist. One affect was the lack of water in the area he was in, which was a dessert. Also, the lack of people in the area didnít help the cyclist out at all. The hills on the road made it more tougher on the cyclist because it drashed what little energy he had left. Also, the sun beating down on him made his body more warm and making it harder for him to focus on what he was trying to do. All of these elements of the environment combined to severely challenge the cyclist's endurance and focus, ultimately hindering his progress.
197	6175	3	3	"In ""Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the cyclist's journey takes a turn for the worse. Initially, the author savors the tranquility of a campground near Lodi, California. He then seeks directions from ""old-timers"" who, from his perspective, ""sounded so sure of themselves when pointing off landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy route."" Trusting their confident guidance, the cyclist sets off, unaware that their advice would ultimately prove detrimental to his ride."
198	6176	3	3	"When the old guy asked if he knew the way and the cyclist confidently replied, ""Yes sir! I own a very good map,"" he believed he was prepared. As he rode, the features of the setting began to affect him. He saw towns and then a sign warning of a ""Rough Road ahead."" This sign, a direct feature of his environment, suggested challenges to come, yet he seemed determined to stick to the future, to the path he had planned. The changing landscape, with its buildings and towns blurring by as he continued onward, might have reinforced his forward focus, making him even more resolute to continue down the road he had chosen."
199	6177	3	3	In the story the cyclist faced many problems, one of the biggest problems was the terrain that he had to maneuver them. The terrain was hilly; having to go up a hill on a bike is tiring and wears you out faster than flat land would, and making him use more energy. The heat was also unbearable making it harder for him to focus, the cyclist did everything he could to keep concise while maneuvering through the terrain and deserted landscape being a huge desert of rolling mountains he pushed forward, finding no civilization anywhere to get a refill of water. For example, if the terrain wasn’t as hilly then it would have made it easier for him using less energy and less strain on his legs; the heat of the desert beating down on him probably slowed his progress also. Heat will make you move slower and a cyclist moving down a barren road with no shade will make the journey seem longer, and impossible. In the end his will and determination got him through the landscape, so he could get the water he needed to finish his trip, showcasing how perseverance can overcome even the most challenging physical obstacles.
200	6178	3	3	In this essay, the features of the setting cause the cyclist to become irritated toward the old men. In this essay, old men give the cyclist directions, and instead of using a map, he takes their advice. However their information is out of date, and takes the cyclist through rolling hills and bumpy roads. The cyclist uses all of his energy to get to unknown towns of no importance, and with no water. The cyclist blames the old men for giving him directions that wasted his energy and time in the desolate countryside. However, he should really blame himself for taking their advice and not utilising a credited map or real directions, as he was ultimately responsible for his choice. Thus, the cyclist's frustration is misdirected, stemming from his own poor judgment.
201	6179	3	3	The setting of where you are riding has a lot to do with the cyclist. Where one chooses to cycle, be it winding mountain roads or paved city streets, influences their experience and approach. In my own opinion I think the setting is the most important part, shaping not only the physical demands but also the mental state and enjoyment of the ride. Ultimately, the environment dictates the type of cyclist one becomes.
202	6180	3	3	In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset. When the scenery is pretty and cheery, he is happy as well. This is shown when the author writes, “I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer-evening.” This quote describes the scenery as a serene, or peaceful place. His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, “I enjoyed.” One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cheery mindset. Therefore, the peaceful scenery affected the cyclist by making him happy. The same can be said for dreary scenery too. This is found when the author says, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” This quote describes the scenery as a place with tumbleweeds. Stereotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely places. This lonely scenery takes its toll on the cyclist. He becomes pessimistic and is thinking of all that could go wrong, not all that could get better. This is found around us every day. The poor and homeless who live with a low standard of living are often sad; they have to exist with the affected the cyclist. In conclusion, the setting does affect the cyclist and his mindset drastically.
203	6181	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the setting changed so drastically. The flat, wide open road turned into short, rolling hills. Because he was already running out of water, it was making it harder for him to have the willpower and determination to go up and down these hills. His determination started to fade because he started to see wide open lands with nothing but tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes. He felt like he was going to dehydrate because the sun was beating down and he had no water left. He used pebbles that he had found to put in his mouth to help circulate the saliva he had in his mouth. He wishes that he would choke on one because he feels so useless, and the harsh environment is actively working against his already dwindling resources, further diminishing his resolve to continue.
204	6182	3	3	In the story, ìDo not exceed posted speed limitî, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faces many hardships on his way to Yosemite due to the features of the setting. The fact that it was a hot summerís day contributed to his hardships. With little water, it was easier for him to get dehydrated. In the text, the author writes, ì.I could drop from heat stroke, on a gorgeous day in June.î (Kurmaskie, @NUM1). This lets the reader know that the heat of June was very dangerous to the cyclist. There was also nobody around except ìOld timers who havenít left the confines of their perches since water was in offingî (Kurmaskie, @NUM2). The narrator stresses his viewpoint on taking directions from these people since their directions are poor. It can be inferred that he meant they were obviously out of date when across directions since the ones they gave him were not correct. The cyclist, already battling the elements, was further hampered by unreliable guidance. The cyclist in this story had a rough time getting to his destination due to the setting.
205	6183	3	3	The terrain in ìDo not exeed posted speed limitî by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist had to cope with many difficulties. He was already lacking water from the anduous journey and then the enviroment turned against him. The narration states, ìI noticed the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills. Energy he barely has. This will drain almost all the energy the cyclist has. Another example is, ìAt some point, tumbleweeds crossed my pathî(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that the cyclist is in the middle of nowhere with barely any water and energy, causing even more problems. The isolation implied by the tumbleweeds further contributes to the cyclist's feeling of vulnerability and highlights the harshness of the environment. In conclusion, the setting in, ìDo not exceed posted speed limitî by Joe Kurmaskie caused many problems for the cyclist.
206	6184	3	3	In the story ìRough road aheadî the setting affectís the cyclist. The cyclist is affected by lack of water, the distance he has to travel, and the hilly terrain. The challenging environment takes a toll on him. ìThe water bottles contain only a few tantalizing sips. wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt,î this statement shows how he was out of water and was tired and hot from the arduous journey. The setting affected the cyclist a lot in the story, creating a struggle against the elements.
207	6185	3	3	The cyclist has it hard; the conditions, lack of water, heat, and rough terrain, are all things that made his ride harder. First, the lack of water took a toll on the amount of energy he had to keep going, dehydrating him and slowing his pace significantly. Second, the heat also affected his trip; it made it hard for him to keep going, and he thought he would die. And the birds would pick at his dead body, a grim thought that haunted him. Last, the terrain didn't help. The trip had many hills, and that used a lot of energy, making it harder to maintain momentum. In conclusion, those are things that worked against the cyclist, creating a truly challenging and potentially deadly situation.
208	6186	3	3	In this I will tell you how the cyclist was being effected. One way is the heat caused him to drink more then he ran out of water, leading to dehydration and fatigue. The next was is the misleading old guys that gave him bad directions, causing him to lose valuable time and energy. Another way was being the long distance and bad terrain slowing him down, making the journey physically taxing. The last reason is the snake that slowed him down, startling him and disrupting his momentum. These combined factors significantly hindered the cyclist's progress and made his ride more challenging.
209	6187	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. He was riding his bike across a place with no cars, no people, no water, or no food, leaving him utterly isolated and reliant on his own resources. This barren landscape presented a significant challenge to his endurance. It was a dangerous journey for him, pushing his physical and mental limits due to the harsh environment, but he made it, ultimately overcoming the odds.
210	6188	3	3	The features of the setting do affect the cyclist. one example is, the condition of his jar. Supplement appropriate details based on the existing information in the original text. Do not make significant expansions or extrapolations, and ensure smooth connection with the original text. The main idea, core viewpoints, and basic structure of the original text must not be altered. The word count difference between the expanded version and the original text must be controlled within 10%. The features of the setting do affect the cyclist. one example is, the condition of his jar. If the jar is cracked or leaking, for instance, the cyclist's hydration and nutrition are compromised, potentially impacting his performance and well-being during the ride.
211	6189	3	3	The features of the setting can affect the cyclist because, say that there was nothing around like a wide open road. It might make you want to go faster and let out your inner speed demon. That's all I can really tell you. Because personally I don't think the setting of where you ride your bike doesn't even matter. Possibly for a bicyclist it can, but to me I don't even think so, though I can see how some might feel differently if they are training for a race or navigating a particularly challenging course.
212	6190	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, because there are no cars, buildings, water, or people in sight. It goes from flat road to rolling hills. Even though he had no water he was determined to keep pedaling. “Rough road Ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit.” At this point he had no water left and he was pretty much in the middle of nowhere. If I was in his situation I would feel hopeless. There was no sign of hope. He just saw endless rolling hills and that was all. Then when he saw the building over the hills he thought he was home free, a beacon in the desolate landscape. So he pedaled up to the building, and that with all the others was abandoned. The cyclist thought he was going to die from dehydration and exhaustion. In conclusion the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist because seeing nothing gives him no hope. If he had cars and buildings on both sides of him that probably would have given him some confidence but that was not the case. He is in the middle of nowhere, utterly alone. He finally came to a bend and said “Then, as easily as rounding a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.”
213	6191	3	3	"Theres many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. His dehydration started with the sun beating down on him and the thirst for water. He was mainly affected when he was out of water and rode by an abandoned Welch's grape juice factory. ""A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head."" Then when he had almost nothing left he spotted a bait shop. ""Somehow I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" Then, as easily as rounding a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me."" **THE BAIT SHOP** is when he saw ""Gary and **SON'S** Fish camp – If you want bait for the big ones were your best bet thus relieving his troubles. The harsh landscape and the false promise of the abandoned factory intensified his suffering, but the bait shop ultimately provided the much-needed relief."
214	6192	3	3	The features of the setting that the author cycles through definitely affect not only his mood, but also his physical condition. To start, it is mentioned that he is in “the high deserts California in June,” and it is implied that the weather is hot, causing the author to sweat as he bikes along. Next, there is a change in terrain and he soon approaches “rolling hills,” which are more difficult to bike on, increasing the physical strain. Finally, the author sees a sign that reads “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” and becomes discouraged because his bike is not even capable of reaching the speed limit, but he still has to manage getting past the rough road, adding to his mental fatigue. After passing this road, he approaches a picture of a boy drinking juice that is posted on a juice factory. Seeing this sign most likely perpetuates his thirst and leaves him more exhausted and frustrated than before. Such features of his surroundings played a large part in the author’s change in mood, impacting his physical state and mental outlook.
215	6193	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, is the beating sun, relentlessly scorching him. The heat dehydrates him and almost kills him. The rocky road is also a factor, slowing his progress considerably. It takes up the time and energy he has to perform, adding to his exhaustion. Another key ingredient of the setting was the desert, an expanse of desolation. There was no one to help him for miles, and there wasn't a place to get water, intensifying his struggle for survival. In conclusion the setting was a big factor in the story, presenting life-threatening challenges.
216	6194	3	3	The setting affects the biker in many ways. For one, he is riding through the high deserts of California during the month of June. It is naturally hot in the summer, but in the desert, it is twice as hot. This means he will dehydrate quicker, and will need more water. The only water the biker can find is from an old pump, but he couldnít drink it since it was so hot; nasty tasting. ìWhen I tried a drop it had the flavor of battery acidî (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His route was deserted, so nobody could help him. Also, the terrain was bad. The hills caused him to use more of his energy, which he needed to stay alive. ìthe growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke caused me to laugh,î (@NUM1). He also encountered dangerous animals like the diamond black rattles back. The setting also affected him mentally because he was silently yelling at himself since he took directions from the old men. He knew he should have taken the right way, instead of trying a short cut that he now realizes is abandoned and dangerous. The isolation of the desert further amplified his feelings of regret and self-blame. The biker is being affected in many ways, both mentally and physically.
217	6195	3	3	The setting causes major problems for the cyclist in the essay, ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.î The cyclist was faced with a desert, traveling in extreme humid temperatures and no water. He encounters poisonous snakes and areas of no buildings or civilization all together. The effect on him was the main conflict of the essay. He had no water during some of the trip and lost all hope. He told himself that it was no use. In the story it says, ìIt didnít really matter. I was going to dieÖî. The extreme measures of the setting caused the cyclist to lose control, putting stones in the mouth to stop thinking of his thirst. The oppressive heat and barren landscape amplified his despair. Over all, the setting caused the cyclist major problems, physically, and mentally.
218	6196	3	3	"The ways the setting can affect a cyclist include the road's shape, riding uphill, and the road's roughness. There was a sign that said ""Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit."" If he didn’t see it, he might have exceeded the appropriate speed for a cyclist, or been unaware of the speed he should maintain, potentially leading to injury. The road was made for cars, so the speed limit is hard to follow for a cyclist, and the cyclist needs to be aware of all hazards."
219	6197	3	3	In the story, ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affects the cyclist. One setting that affected him was the first setting. In this setting he used up his water and it was hot. This affected the cyclist because he was starting to feel dehydrated and thought he was going to die. The text showed this when it said ìI could drop from heat strokeî, later when the cyclist came to an abandoned juice factory he thought about how thirsty he was. This affected him because usually when you think about thirst you get thirstier. This also made him disappointed. The final setting affected him because he had finally got water and wasnít thirsty. This shows how the setting affected the cyclist and his physical and mental state throughout his journey.
220	6198	3	3	"On that long bike ride the cyclist was affected by the setting. He was affected by the lack of water, the heat, and the bad directions; throughout the story the cyclist ran out of water due to bad directions from some men. ""Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" He ran out of water and became dehydrated through his trip. The heat had a major part in his dehydration during the bike ride. ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" I have been to California and it is hot. The trip was made even longer due to some bad directions from some old men. ""Because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh."" The gentlemen gave him wrong directions because in their time that was right information, but now the land has changed and the directions were wrong. He should've considered their information was outdated. When going on bike rides the setting of the rides is a great help or a bad help. The cyclist experienced how the setting of a bike ride can affect him a great deal."
221	6199	3	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist very much. For example, the sun was beginning to beat down, making the black asphalt shimmer. Another example, I was hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, trying to stave off the mounting thirst. The setting were hot and dry. It effected the cyclist very much. It was to the point of dying, as the heat threatened to overwhelm him.
222	6200	3	3	The cyclist in this essay was a very brave man. He had many obsticles in his journey but he still made it. Nature was most definatly not on his side that day. He had to ride his bike up and down hills several times which wears you out very quickly. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. After he got threw the hills, he came to a sigh “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT”. Now he has to go through bumply roads. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. Now the poor guy had to deal with snakes bigger than him! Thankfully he got by the snake, alive. Over one long cripping hill, a building came into view. The man thinks he found someplace to get water, but its an abonded building ,by the looks of it – and been a welch’s grape Juice Factory and botting plant. Despite facing relentless challenges from the terrain and wildlife, the cyclist pressed on, demonstrating remarkable resilience.
223	6201	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it is hot, therefore he gets thirsty. When he says ìthe sun was beating on meî this shows it was hot, implying the heat was intense and direct. That's one of the reasons why he was tired and dehydrated, as the excessive heat would quickly deplete his body's water reserves. Consequently, the harsh environment significantly contributed to his physical exhaustion.
224	6202	3	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist about old timers giving him wrong information about taking this short cut he was going to take. Running out of water and energy, he was doubting himself and giving up on the race. The desolate, sun-baked landscape amplified his feelings of isolation and despair, making the unreliable advice from the locals even more devastating to his morale and thus contributed to him giving up.
225	6203	3	3	"In the piece, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist felt black humor, despair and then relief due to the features of the setting. The cyclist felt black humor, due to the features. This was because it was very ironic were he was. It was a hot desert and he needed something to drink. He passes a closed juice factory. This sparked his black humor. The cyclist felt despair due to the features. This was because as far as he could see, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind."" This gave him the feeling there was no chance he could survive. This made him despair. The cyclist felt relief later on due to the features. He eventually got to a bait shop. When he was this live and so he felt relief. Of this is, ""Then as easily as I hobbles, thirst and fear were all behind me."" In this piece the features were determined how the cyclist felt. Therefore, the cyclist's emotional state was intrinsically linked to the environment he traversed."
226	6204	3	3	In the essay ìDo not exceed posted spedd limitî by @PERSON1 many features of the setting effect the cyclist. First, when he arrived at the first ìtownî and said, ìthis place might have been a thriving little spot at one time ñ say, before the last world war.î This deserted ghost town setting was like a joke and had a small effect on the cyclist because it was the beginning of the day and he still had a good water supply. Though when he arrived at the ramshackle shed surrounded by several rusty pumps the effect it had wasnít so mild. He says, ìThe sight was troubling.î The dilapidated state of the pumps and the shed amplified his growing unease. Then when he got on his hands and knees and started working the pump the situation didnít get much better. All that came out was a drop or two that tasted like battery acid. Lastly, when he arrived at an abandoned welchís Grape juice factory after several miles. This had a very wearing effect on him since the water supply was low and he had cycled into disappointment after disappointment. The factory, a symbol of past industry, now only offered further desolation. This setting in this essay seemed very abandoned and hopeless. It was only determination that got this cyclist through it.
227	6205	3	3	The story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” is about a cyclist who got bad directions to Yosemite National Park and has a depleting water supply in extreme heat. He is doubtful that he will make his journey because he is dehydrated and dizzy. The sun beat down mercilessly, each mile feeling like ten. His tongue felt thick and his vision swam. He wondered if he should have trusted his initial instinct about the route. Given his dwindling water and the baking heat, reaching Yosemite seemed increasingly unlikely, a distant dream fading with every rotation of the pedals, thus, filling him with doubt.
228	6206	3	3	The setting in this story is important because if you don't have a setting then this will not make sense; setting is something everyone can do. It can be anywhere or anything. The setting helps put the whole story back together. The setting in this story is @LOCATION1 spending time with his family. Setting is a very important part in a movie/video, shaping the narrative and providing context for the characters and events that unfold. Therefore, the setting is critical for comprehension and overall storytelling.
229	6207	3	3	The way I would set my affected cyclist is by him riding through something you would never think he can set through, then overcoming his intention. Imagine him facing a seemingly impenetrable headwind, a relentless force pushing him back with every pedal stroke. The wind howls, blurring his vision with rain, and the road ahead seems to stretch on forever, an endless, uphill battle. But he grits his teeth, lowers his head, and focuses on the rhythm of his legs, pushing through the impossible resistance with sheer will and determination, proving his initial limitations were just perceptions.
230	6208	3	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” affect the cyclist. The cyclist started at a campground, conversing with some old-timers, and he asks them how to get to Yosemite, and they tell him a shortcut that turns out to be out of date. On the road to Yosemite he sees nothing except abandoned towns, remnants of a forgotten past. He is really thirsty and there’s no water anywhere to quench his parched throat. He thought he was going to die, imagining his demise in this desolate landscape. He said, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” It was a hot summer day, the sun beating down mercilessly, and there were tumbleweeds and snakes by the road, adding to the sense of desolation and making him feel hotter and more thirsty than he would be if it was cooler and if there was a big river flowing by the road, offering relief. But it was hot and dry in California, almost desert-like, and it made him feel like he was dying because he was in the middle of nowhere; therefore, the setting profoundly affected the cyclist's physical and mental state, pushing him to the brink of despair.
231	6209	3	3	This cyclist had the conditions of the land to deal with. He didn't have too much water with him, and there wasn't a good source anywhere near him that he could see. He just had to keep going. He also talked about how the road was rough, a seemingly endless stretch of cracked asphalt and loose gravel. This was conflicting on how long it took him to get to the next place with water. Moreover, he was in a desert area. The air was dry and hot, the heat was making him sweat, and that was leading him to become dehydrated, forcing him to ration his dwindling supply even more carefully. The cyclist knew he had to carefully manage his resources and push through the challenging conditions to reach his destination and replenish his water.
232	6210	3	3	In the story ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî the features of the setting effect the cyclist. They effect the cyclistís confidence, and hope. I say this because through out the story he sees things that would consern other people like the towns that are suppose to be the best end up ìGhost townsî and the road from flat to hills. Yet he continues on and then says ìwhat I believed was my last burst of energy,î ìI was going to die.î The cyclist dosent think he can continue but manages to keep going hoping that the next horizon to see a building or something. Hope saved his life because if he knew he could not continue that he could die. The setting's desolate nature, marked by the unexpected decline of once-promising towns, chips away at his resolve with each passing mile. The relentless shift from flat terrain to arduous hills further drains his physical and mental strength. This gradual erosion of his resources, combined with the bleak landscape, leads to his despair. Ultimately, his unwavering hope for a sign of civilization fuels his perseverance, proving vital to his survival as he confronts the overwhelming odds presented by the harsh environment.
233	6211	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One reason the features of the setting affect him is because it is hot outside which makes him need more water. An example of this is “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This constant need for hydration highlights the impact of the arid environment. Another example of being hot outside is “A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This illustrates the extreme temperatures which further emphasizes the demanding conditions imposed by the setting on the cyclist. Therefore, the heat necessitates increased water consumption, demonstrating the setting's direct influence.
234	6212	3	3	In the short story “Rough Road Ahead,” a cyclist is pushed through an extremely harsh setting trying to get to Yosemite National Park. In the story the narrator takes a trip to Yosemite National park after getting directions from two older men; what the narrator doesn't know is that the road ahead is indeed rough. One narrator states “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” The narrator is really taking a beating from the travel, and this rocky, dry climate is really taking its toll. From reading this story, the setting does not do any good for him other than the general store he finds in the end, offering a brief respite. Like the title states, the setting of this story was a “Rough Road Ahead,” and this challenging environment significantly impacts the narrator's arduous journey.
235	6213	3	3	The setting affect the cyclist features because if the cyclist was riding in @LOCATION1 around june the affect @MONTH1 not had been that harsh. But overall the setting out begin in a hot place with limited water was not a good thing. That's how the cyclist is affected by the setting. The harsh heat and lack of hydration clearly impacted the cyclist's performance and well-being, demonstrating the significant influence of the environment.
236	6214	3	3	Being a cyclist and in the condition he was in would be even worse in the setting he was in, such as the heat of California, and difficult condition of the path he was on. The sun beat down relentlessly, amplifying the physical strain. Him being so hot and tired from the difficult hilly trail would be worse with having the lack of supply of water. The author was very dehydrated and was on the verge of fainting. If it were not so hot, and if he had sufficient water, the cyclist would have been in a much better condition, able to manage the challenging terrain more effectively, and ultimately avoid the severe consequences of dehydration.
237	6215	3	3	The cyclist in the article almost died from dehydration and heat stroke in the desert and wrote his misadventure in a light hearted, humourous way. I commend him for almost dying and laughing about it and then turning around and blaming it on old people. He is an inspiration for reckless young folk, showing them how to narrowly escape death in scorching conditions with a smile. His experience is a testament to youthful resilience, even if misdirected, and proves that humor can be found even in the face of extreme peril, however misguided his blame may be.
238	6216	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî time setting very much affects the cyclist during the story. One of the things that affect him during the story is that it was a very hot, sun-scorching day; the intense heat beating down on him made the ride even more challenging. Also, he ran out of water, and there was nothing but desert and poisonous snakes around, amplifying his desperation. Another thing is that when he ran out of water there were no shady spots just desert, so he started to become very thirsty, his body craving hydration. In the essay it also said he reached a part where he saw a sign that said ì Rough Road Ahead, Do not exceed posted speed limited, so the road conditions starting to get rough; this jarring terrain further tested his physical endurance. In the end of the essay he reaches a camp where it is all peace and relaxed, and they have cold water there; this affects him because he feels replenished, a wave of relief washing over him. All these different features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly.
239	6217	3	3	The setting was affecting the character, because as the day got hotter and the sun beat down on the open road, he got thirstier. Also because when he got to the sign about rough roads ahead, with its stark warning and implication of difficulty, he started to get worried and kinda paranoid about potential tire blowouts or getting stranded, so that's how the setting affected him.
240	6218	3	3	There was a number of things that affected the cyclists during his travel. First off, at the old town there wasnít any real water he could drink. So he was out of water and was going to be thirsty. Also, itís the middle of June in California, itís very hot and the sun is going to wear him out pretty quickly. Another thing that affected the cyclist is the steep hills he has to go up and down. For example, when he says ìOver one long, crippling hillî, heís saying the hills are very hard for him. These environmental and geographical challenges clearly took a toll, making the journey significantly more difficult. Those are the features that affected the cyclist in the story.
241	6219	3	3	The setting of this essay was the California desert in June. If any of the setting's features affected the cyclist (which they all did), this had the biggest impact. In the fifth paragraph, the reader learns that the author was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” My prior knowledge tells me that California is generally always a very hot place, especially in the desert in June, the hottest month of the year. This would have greatly affected the cyclist, who was riding for over fifty miles through the California desert with a limited supply of water. This put him at a great risk for dehydration, which he tells the reader he reaches in the last line of paragraph ten. This terrain and the extremely hot conditions would make the cyclist very tired and dehydrated, making his journey to @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 all the more difficult, highlighting just how significantly the desert environment impacted his experience.
242	6220	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Like he was in a desert, no one to give him good information, no towns close by that are still running, it was a hot summer day, no water near by. These affected the cyclist because they made him not sweaty, dry mouth, no energy, and he was having alot of doubt that he was not going to make his journey alive. In the story they cyclist said, ''I picked up some pebble and put them in my mouth. With my luer. I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didnít really matter. I was going to die. ''When he said that he showed alot of doubt, highlighting his despair. Everytime he got to a town or bulding it was abandoned, furthering his isolation. He saw an abandoned building witch was ironically a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant, a cruel reminder of what he lacked. That made him even more thirstier, intensifying his physical suffering. Thus, the harsh environment and its cruel ironies profoundly impacted the cyclist's physical state and mental resolve.
243	6221	3	3	The setting in the story greatly affected the cyclist. The main setting was that he was riding his bike in the desert. The desert is really hot, causing rapid dehydration, so he needed more water than he would have if he were riding in the woods or if there was snow. Also there were hills on his travel that he had to ride his bike up which takes more energy, depleting his resources faster, so again he would have needed more water than if the road was flat; the sun beating down on him only made this worse. Finally, because of the terrain he was riding on the animals he ran into, a snake, could have hurt him, and the rough ground increased his risk of a fall. Because the setting of the story was in the desert the cyclist was affected more then he had thought he would be.
244	6222	3	3	In this paragraph I will be explaining some features of the setting that affected the cyclist. One affect was the uneven, bumpy roads he was trying to cycle on. If it was flat he wouldnít have to really be more aware, cause with bumpy roads he has to look out for rocks, holes in the road, and loose gravel that could cause him to lose control. Another affect are the hills. He had to put out more energy than if the hills were just flat, forcing him to work harder and potentially tire more quickly. Those are some reasons that explain the features of the setting that affect the cyclist's ride and overall experience.
245	6223	3	3	Some features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey to Yosemite. Starting off, ad men who havenít seen the changes this world made for about a decade, gave the cyclist a bad start. If the cyclist wouldnít have gotten the shortcut information, he wouldnít have been without water in abandoned towns. When the cyclist arrives at some rusty pumps, he decided to check it out and see if there is any water. The water was really not and it tasted like battery acid. The cyclist decided to keep going, even though he was running out of water. When he came to a snake in the rode, he had to get by his ìdehydrated state.î I would imagine this would be dangerous if you couldnít focus well in the road. He then came upon @ORGANIZATION1 that has do and abandoned. He obviously couldnít get any water there seeing as how bad of condition the building was. When the cyclist had no water, he became dehydrated and unfortunately there were no stops for water on his journey that day to Yosemite, highlighting the harsh and unforgiving environment he was forced to traverse.
246	6224	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways; it was like a crazy maze, the road he was on, and him not really knowing where he was going didn't help him, or not having enough water. The winding and unfamiliar roads disoriented him, making it difficult to navigate. The scarcity of water sources in the area further exacerbated his challenges, leading to dehydration and fatigue. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
247	6225	3	3	"The cyclist's adventure was very much affected by his setting. It seemed as though the worse his setting became, the worse he personally felt. For example, when he hit the ghost town, he just laughed. Once he got to the fork in the road, he saw less of once exisiting civilization, and he says, ""This sight is troubling."" Once he moves on, he gets more discouraged by the ""Rough Road Ahead"" sign. It seems as though the more dehydrated he gets, the worse things became for him, impacting his morale. The climate in the story also becomes increasingly difficult. The land at first was flat and easy to ride; as it got harder to bike on, the cyclist grew wary and delirious, but knew he had to keep going. The area in which the cyclist was in, therefore, had an enormous effect on him emotionally, influencing his mental state and ultimately shaping his experience."
248	6226	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him in a near-death situation. He said “sometimes life can be so cruel” because he was running out of water, running out of strength, and running out of patience in the desolate landscape. Also a snake, ""it really did look like a diamond back,"" could have killed him with its venomous bite if he wasn't careful. He was in the desert, exposed and vulnerable, where anything could happen. The setting of encountering old men who didn't know anything helpful and the oppressive heat further threatened his well-being, pushing him closer to his limits. The situation would have been drastically different if he were anywhere else, highlighting how the harsh environment directly contributed to his perilous experience."
249	6227	3	3	"The cyclists problem in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by ""@PERSON1"" is dehydration and the California terrain is the cause. California is full of long deserts that can exceed @NUM1 degrees in summer, and the cyclist was exerting himself so dehydration was inevitable. The dry air further exacerbates the issue, rapidly drawing moisture from the body. In the story the cyclist says ìI could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in Juneî so the setting is obviously a hazard. This highlights how the combination of exertion and the unforgiving environment leads to a dangerous situation."
250	6228	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very serious way. The features cause him to consider he might die soon, as well as present a variety of challenges to him. The setting takes place in the deserts of California, in early summer. There are no other people in there, no establishments, towns, etc.; a dangerous feature of the setting in addition to it being in a desert in summer, for example, the author learned that it might have been a thriving little spot at one time—sat, before the last world war. The cyclist is given almost a hopelessness as well as determination to survive as he runs out of water. For example, he says, ""I was going to lie…slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" The author makes the trip to a fishing camp and survives. He learns, because the setting is now lifeless and deserted, to not listen to old people who remember the current setting as it was many decades earlier. Because the features of the setting nearly kill the cyclist, the cyclist learns a lesson about relying on present realities rather than past glories for survival."
251	6229	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the author was exhausted, and as she was riding her bike, there was no place for her to stop and fill up her water bottle, leaving her dehydrated and struggling to continue. Ultimately, the lack of available resources in the setting directly impacted her physical well-being and ability to cycle comfortably.
252	6230	3	3	The road was deserted; there wasn't a building, car, or house in sight. He was stuck and, thus, in the middle of nowhere without any water or food; poisonous snakes and the heat could make him collapse from dehydration.
253	6231	3	3	"The cyclist on her trips sees a lot of features that would discourage her. She is riding in the high deserts of California in June (Kurmaskie). We all know deserts are steaming hot and dry, especially in June. She also encounters hills (Kurmaskie); to make matters worse, she was travelling on hills in the extreme heat. Though the cyclist goes through many perilous obstacles, she makes it to camp and lives. ""I could see the horizon, telling myself that I could make it that far, I'd be fine"" (Kurmaskie). This shows the author's dedication and that if you don't give up, you will be fine, demonstrating resilience in the face of adversity."
254	6232	3	3	In the story, ìDo not exceed posted speed limit,î the setting is an all- important factor. The author feels the need to describe the path that the cyclist is following and the details each place he stops, such as in ìone ramshackle shedÖand a corral that couldnít hold the lamest muleÖî and ìThe cool pines and rushing rivers of YosemiteÖî. These carefully chosen details paint a vivid picture of the cyclist's journey and highlight the stark contrasts between the different environments he encounters. In a story such as this, setting is of great importance, especially since it is so rapidly changing. The story itself would be of much different quality, likely of a lower quality, if the author never put emphasis on the areas that the cyclist rode past; without this detailed backdrop, the narrative would lose much of its richness and depth. Therefore, this story would not be worth reading if the author were not as skilled a writer as he is, as his skillful use of setting is integral to the story's overall impact.
255	6233	3	3	The setting of the cyclist was harsh, the weather was too intense to be cycling your heart out all day; the sun beat down relentlessly, baking the asphalt and radiating waves of heat that shimmered before him. The wind, when it came, offered no respite, only swirling gusts that threatened to throw him off balance.
256	6234	3	3	The feature of setting affect the cyclists because if you are a guy and you ride a bike then you might have to worry about falling off your bike, or riding out of control and into water. If you keep at a fast pace and don’t have any water then you can get dehydrated; extreme heat from the sun can worsen this. In the essay it tells how he had ran out of water and he thought he was going to die he had gotten dehydrated, but luckily he had found somewhere to get something to drink, demonstrating how crucial the environment is to a cyclist's well-being.
257	6235	3	3	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" the mans ride gets pretty rough. Because he took the old mens advice on a shortcut, the once enjoyable ride became a jarring ordeal. The smooth asphalt gave way to a poorly maintained dirt road, riddled with potholes and loose gravel. The car bounced and shuddered, making it difficult to maintain control. The shortcut, it seemed, was proving to be anything but."
258	6236	3	3	"The cyclist in the essay goes through phases that affect him differently according to the setting. At first, the cyclist knows where he is and is very familiar with his location. He is excited for his ride and ready to accomplish it. He then shows up at a ""ghost town."" He begins to have doubt in his mind about what the old men told him. This place was completely deserted, and there was no water for him. He began to feel discouraged when he passed the Grape juice factory, and he seriously believed this was the end for him, facing potential dehydration and exhaustion. His hope and enjoyment finally returned to him after he saw the sign for the bait shop, suggesting a possible source of water and renewed energy. The biker's feelings and attitude changed as often as the setting did, showing the profound impact of environment on his mental and emotional state, ultimately influencing his perception of the journey."
259	6237	3	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist in many ways. At first when he sees the tall pines and the river he is calm and chilled out. But when he sees the abandoned ì@PERSON1ís Grape Juiceî factory he becomes desperate and thinks he is going to die out in the desert. A guy travels to @ORGANIZATION1 where he meets ìold timers and they give him a ìshortcutî to the park. He then goes on his bike to the park taking their ìshortcut.î While traveling he starts to run out of water and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert. ìIt dinít really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.î This quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water. This relates because he becomes desperate for water because he is out in the desert in the middle of June, and the harsh environment is taking its toll. Thus, the setting's transformation from a calming forest to an arid desert directly fuels the cyclist's shift from tranquility to despair.
260	6238	3	3	The features can affect the cyclist very well or not. It depends on what condition is happening. For example, he could fall. Does he have a traveling first aid kit? This is crucial, as immediate treatment of minor injuries like cuts and scrapes can prevent infection and ensure he can continue his journey safely. Therefore, considering potential setbacks and preparing for them is vital for a cyclist's well-being and successful trip.
261	6239	3	3	Setting is a very important element to the story ìRough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit: by Joe Kurmaskie. Kurmaskie experienced a harsh scenery with high temperatures, low water supply and wild animals. High temperatures without an efficient supply of water can lead to heatstroke, hyperthermia, dehydration and even death. It is very important to always be prepared with enough food and water to sustain yourself through an event such as being last. Dealing with wild life can also be an obstacle. You never know how any animal is going to react to your presence so you must be as cautionary as possible around non-domesticated animals. In conclusion, scenery and setting of a story can make all the difference of how interesting a story can be and how informative; for instance, if Kurmaskie had experienced no weather with plenty of food and water riding through a flat small town the story would not be as interesting.
262	6240	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie. The setting effects how fast, hard and long the cyclist needs to pedal. For example, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The cyclist was going 12 mph, where the speed limit was 55 mph. The cyclist was beginning to lose hope after reading the sign, but he kept going. Furthermore, not only was the land adding pressure to the cyclist, but so does the heat from the sun. For instance, the cyclist says, “… and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke…”. The heat begins to affect the author’s health and his perseverance, as he battles the rising temperature. The unforgiving landscape and scorching sun combine to test his limits. The setting, therefore, significantly affects the mental and physical strain the cyclist has to endure, pushing him to his breaking point.
263	6241	3	3	This story was a great motivation for older man that can still be healthy and feel like an teenager again. It showed how much effort he put to his goal and how he survive. Forty miles he peddled for forty miles to drink same water the cyclist was and interesting story not ginaupup, revealing his dedication. This dedication proves that age is just a number when one is determined to achieve peak physical condition.
264	6242	3	3	It affects cyclists because the condition determines the pace and even how fast they could travel, influencing their speed and potentially impacting their ability to maintain a consistent rhythm during their ride. Ultimately, these factors play a significant role in the overall cycling experience.
265	6243	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist was in California, which is an extremely hot place in the desert in June. These features made dehydration a more keen possibility. Another example, is paragraph ten. It explains how the rough road, tumbleweeds, and large snake made it hard for the cyclist to keep his balance without water. Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice; this made the cyclist think more about water and become very thirsty. Although there were some positive effects of the setting on the cyclist, the pebbles allowed him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst. Also, the bait shop allowed him to obtain something to drink and not die from dehydration. Ultimately, the setting's harsh conditions presented significant challenges to the cyclist, but certain elements also provided small respites that aided his survival.
266	6244	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. One way it affects the cyclist is because of the weather condition. Being that it is very hot outside the cyclist does not have enough water, impacting his stamina and energy levels. Another way it affects the cyclist is because of the condition alongside the road. For example the tumbleweeds and the snakes pose physical hazards, making the ride more dangerous. Being that its hot out most likely the desert is in process of a drought and he gets very dehydrated, further hindering his performance. I believe these are the reasons because it all makes a lot of sense and affects the cyclist, ultimately shaping his experience and challenges.
267	6245	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the lack of water was the biggest thing. Without cool water he had nothing to reboost his energy, sapping his strength. He would get tired out faster. Even if he does find water it's hot, like when he says, "" brakish water feeling some where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" This shows how in ""the high desert of June,"" the water is all very hot. Even after he pumped the well for several minutes the water still wouldn’t cool down; the hot desert had baked everything above and below ground. So when you go to get something liquid which heats and cools faster than solids it will be hot. Also the rough road made it difficult for the cyclist to travel it, slowing his progress considerably. We know the road's rough when he says, "" large highway signs dumped out at me. It read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT."" This also shows you couldn’t go fast, further hindering his journey and adding to his physical exertion. Ultimately, the harsh environment, characterized by scarce, boiling water and a relentlessly rough road, presents significant challenges that directly impact the cyclist's ability to persevere."
268	6246	3	3	The cyclist is dehydrated. He has lack of water for a significant distance before he realizes that the old men would have been right, had he been riding before the last world war. But any town he rode into, was just a run down, deserted, and abandoned piece of desert. He says, It was a sad, hopeless, laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. It was clear that he was getting more and more dehydrated, but was not quite ready to die. He still had enough energy to keep going, but hope was fading. His lips were cracked, and his tongue felt like sandpaper. Then all at once after climbing a large hill he gains all hope back. He sees Gary and Wilber’s fish camp. The rider is safe now, he stumbles into the modern looking bathroom and drinks from the sink. The cool water rushes down his throat, reviving him. He is now safe, ready to ride, and avoid all men who haven’t moved from their front porches in years; the ordeal has taught him to trust his own instincts.
269	6247	3	3	The harsh setting in ìDO Not Exceed Posted Speed limit ìby Joe Kurmaskie made the journey for the cyclist more difficult due to the hot weather and the inconsistancy of the pavement. The very hot June day was a cause of the cyclist slowing down. ìwide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.î This proves that the cyclist is very hot due to the summer heat. Another factor of the cyclist slowing down is the inconsistant of the pavement on the road ìFlat road was replaced by short rolling hills.î This proves that the road could be slowing the cyclist also. It seems the cyclist has a lot against him, between the heat and changing terrain. But if he keeps his head up he can make it to ìYosemite,î ultimately overcoming the difficult conditions.
270	6248	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the hotness of the deserts of California because the cyclist was sweating profusely, and quickly depleting his water bottles in an effort to stay hydrated. Also, when the cyclist saw the building shimmering in the distance, he was filled with hope that he could rest and perhaps get a ride to where he was going, offering a temporary respite from the harsh conditions, but the building was revealed to be abandoned years earlier, crushing his hopes and forcing the cyclist to continue onward. These are some features of the setting that significantly affect the cyclist's physical and mental state, ultimately shaping his difficult journey.
271	6249	3	3	Several features of the setting that affected the cyclist were time of year, the desert land, the lack of civilization, the lack of resources ñ especially water, and the rugged characteristics of the land. The cyclist was traveling during the summer time, which was the hottest time of the year. He was also traveling through the deserts which create an even hotter climate. ìI was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,î was a quote from the selection that tells us this. If he had been traveling in the **late fall**, for example, he **might** have been more comfortable. Throughout his trip, the author does not after come desert civilization. He runs into a deserted factory and miles of land without people. The fact that he is traveling through desert terrain also helps us realize that water is scarce. He has trouble finding a place to get water. This made the trip extra hard and discouraging. ìI was going to dieî he says. As he travels farther, the land also becomes harder to travel on. ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hillsî this characteristic is a setting, like the others, negatively affects the cyclist by making his journey harder. These environmental factors, combined, significantly amplified the challenges the cyclist faced, turning what might have been a manageable journey into a struggle for survival.
272	6250	3	3	"The cyclist surrounds did have an affect. In paragraph two the cyclist describes how “I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening the.” To have a wonderful day to begin with was arguably assurance everything would be fine. Confidence was a factor for the beautiful weather as well as he knew a short cut. In paragraph @NUM1 the cyclist mentions how old men looked at his map and pointed out “this breezy jaunt.” The cyclist just thought his life got a little easier. Then in paragraph @NUM2 the cyclist comes upon the ""traditional definition of a ghost town."" This setting was nothing like the old men were talking about. ""Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts."" In paragraph @NUM3, this caused confusion and worry. ""This sight was troubling."" ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" The cyclist was ""hitting my water bottles pretty regularly."" This setting made the cyclist uncomfortable as well as the ""two hundred degrees."" The cyclist then began puzzled and distraught. ""I noticed the terrain changing"" in this quote the cyclist's settings in June have caused confusion. But in the end the cyclist succeeded, showing how the shifting environment profoundly impacted the cyclist's experience, from initial confidence to eventual disorientation."
273	6251	3	3	"The features of the setting in ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, affect the cyclist because he is in a desert with no water and the town he seeks is farther than he anticipates. The relentless sun and barren landscape amplify his desperation. ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean,"" he thinks, revealing his lack of confidence in navigating this desolate part of his journey. The harsh environment, with its implied lack of resources and unforgiving conditions, directly contributes to the cyclist's fear and underscores the severity of his predicament, highlighting the crucial role of the setting in shaping his experience and outlook."
274	6252	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the road could be damaged or there could be a lot of hills. One example is on pg @NUM1 “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” This explains the conditions of the road could be dangerous, as a bump could cause an accident. That is how the condition of the road can be affective. Thus, the cyclist's experience is directly influenced by the road's quality and topography.
275	6253	3	3	"When the cyclist takes off on the road again he has plenty of water, strong legs and enjoys the sunny and warm day. But as the day gets more hot and the terrain more desert like and cough, the cyclist begins to lose his confidence. As he keeps riding, his water supply is depleting and he begins to believe that he will die. At one point, talking about the terrain he says, ""I toiled on at some point, tumbleweeds crossed any path."" It sounds as if he is struggling very hard to keep going without water and a clue about where he is, the sun beating down relentlessly. When he is almost sure that he is going to die from the queuring that he says, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" This shows that by this time his confidence was lost because of the insane heat and unbearable terrain. He begins to lose his sanity along with his strength because the setting around him was so terrible, his hope dwindling with each passing mile, making the situation more grave for him."
276	6254	3	3	"The features of the settings affect the cyclist in many ways. When he starts off, he is bright and happy, just as the silence is nice and calming. There is a pace that makes him feel like nothing is wrong. ""I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face."" After about @NUM1 miles on the cold, his life was getting low, and he came to his second abundant place. He then felt a little disturbed and worried. He needed to find a place with water. ""This site was trebling."" There he finds a water plant, and his hopes rise a bit, until he finds the water isn't good. ""A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brickish water feeling some which is in the neighborhood of two hundred trees."" So he moves on, and finally he reaches life! He is so relieved he can't believe his luck. ""Then as easily as rounding a body my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me."" The setting affects the mood in a very big way; the cyclist feels as the setting looks, reflecting the powerful impact of the environment on his emotional state and physical well-being throughout his journey."
277	6255	3	3	The features of the setting greatly effect the cyclist; one way it effects him is because it is so hot and he doesn’t have any water left. The relentless sun beats down, intensifying his thirst. Also, because there are so many almost-buildings and ghost towns, this gives him a palpable haze of uncertainty that he will be able get the water, a shimmer of hope intertwined with the desolation. The oppressive heat and abandoned structures combine to create an environment of both physical and psychological challenge for the cyclist.
278	6256	3	3	Almost all of the cyclist’s surroundings are old and barren, the landscape seemingly untouched by time. Hot, desert-like weather intensified the harshness of the environment. The road itself was hard to ride on, adding to the challenge. “Flat Road was replaced by short rolling hills,” further impeding his progress. So his ride was a very rough and tiresome one, a true test of endurance against the unyielding elements and unforgiving terrain.
279	6257	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by how much confidence in where he’s going and how he’s gonna get there. Having no water can diminish resolve and impact the cyclist's belief in his ability to complete the journey.
280	6258	3	3	If the sun had not been so blaring and the road so treacherous, perhaps the journey would have been easier. Also, the elevation often bothers the author because he had to get over it while battling dryness and dehydration.
281	6259	3	3	When cycling or doing any outdoor sport, the setting matters greatly. If it's cold you need a jacket. Hot you need water. Depending on how secure it could be life or death. It could be really hilly and you might get tired, and if you have no water you could die. Also, it depends if it's in a city, suburb, small town, desert, highway; all these factors play a huge roll in cycling. Considering these environmental variables is crucial for preparation; ensuring appropriate clothing, hydration, and safety measures are in place will help to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience.
282	6260	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in negative ways. The cyclist was in California in June weather. If it wasn’t so hot, he wouldn’t have needed water as badly. He wouldn’t have been sweating as much. Also, there weren’t any buildings or cars around, so there wasn’t anyone to help him. ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structures of any kind.î These features of the setting could affect the cyclist. Because of the isolated and hot environment, the cyclist faces a greater challenge in obtaining assistance and staying hydrated.
283	6261	3	3	In the essay, ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î written by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature that affects him is that he is cycling ìthrough the high deserts of California in Juneî(Kurmaskie). This affect would mean that the author would be dehydrated faster because of the intense heat and dryness. The cyclist, author, is dehydrated before he can make it to the next town because he ìgathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in [his] mouthî(Kurmaskie) hoping to stimulate saliva production. This action illustrates how the harsh desert environment directly impacts his physical state, pushing him to desperate measures for basic hydration.
284	6262	3	3	"In the essay Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the surrounding setting affected the cyclist. The setting was somewhere outside Lodi, California in early summer. The cyclist took advice from some old men that led him to difficult places to get out of. As the sun made things hotter and his water started to deplete getting to Yosemite was much harder. The cyclist was traveling through high deserts of California in June. When the terrain started to change from flat road to rolling hills the cyclist pushed himself even harder to get to his destination. The sun and hot air dehydrated him faster. After traveling over, ""along, crippling hill,î  the cyclist had to stop and even tried sucking on a pebble in an effort to take his mind off thirst. When he found a habited store he was exhausted and relieved. These features of the setting had a big effect on the cyclist, as the weather dehydrated him while the terrain exhausted him."
285	6263	3	3	The settings in the essay affected the cyclist mentally and physically. The fact that he was riding through the desert in June affected how long his water supply lasted. If he had been riding in the spring then his water supply would’ve lasted longer and he would’ve had more energy. Since the town the old men had told the cyclist about was abandoned that also affected the cyclist because he had to keep on going even though he was getting weaker. What affected the cyclist most, I think, was when he arrived at the bait store. If that had been abandoned like everything else, the cyclist would’ve died. Luckily though it wasn’t, and he was able to drink water. The factory affected him mentally because the picture of the boy was haunting him in a way due to the fact he was drinking juice, something the cyclist couldn’t do. All in all, I think the conditions that the cyclist was in affected him greatly, highlighting how environmental factors can influence one's physical and mental state. Since I’ve fainted from dehydration before, I know how it feels to be without water. First you get a headache; then your mouth dries up and desperation sets in, and finally you get dizzy.
286	6264	3	3	"The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affects the cyclist's physical and mental state. There are negative and positive effects for each state. The physical effects of the cyclist because of the settings are apparent throughout the story. For example, when the cyclist reaches Mr. Patterson and Bill’s Fish Camp, he is able to hydrate once again. This positive effect makes the cyclist healthy and safe once again. The setting impacts the cyclist very substantially. This can be seen when the cyclist is in the comfortable camp around Lone Pine. He feels happy in this area. This positive effect prepares the cyclist to go on the trip to Yosemite. Also, when the cyclist reaches the “Ramshackle Station”, with several rusty pumps, and a corral, he feels troubled. He is negatively affected mentally by the little amount of available water. In addition, the cyclist felt ""sad"" and ""hopeless"" when cycling in the dry, arid terrain. The cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place. Finally, the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp. He describes the feeling by saying that his troubles are now “behind” him. The setting's positive effect in this instance changes the mental state from negative to positive. Setting was the main factor in deciding upon the cyclist’s physical and mental state. Setting affects the cyclist’s physical and mental state in positive and negative ways almost equally in the story."
287	6265	3	3	"The setting made the cyclist feel lonely. The cyclist lost hope quickly because she never saw any people or water on the way. The cyclist said they saw a “ghost town”. Before he got to the fish camp the cyclist saw no one and was becoming dehydrated. This caused him to lose hope, and at some points he thought he was going to die. For example, he says, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” The barren landscape, devoid of any sign of life, amplified his despair. It is clear that the setting affected the cyclist in a very negative way."
288	6266	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was in a forest with uneven terrain and thick roots. This was a bumpy trip with a lot of troubles along the way, navigating fallen branches and slippery leaves. This was a long trip, testing his endurance and skill. But he made it through, tough with a story to tell in the end, a testament to his perseverance against the challenging forest landscape.
289	6267	3	3	The setting of the essay, ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî effects the cyclists physical and emotional attitude. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist, ìrode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on [his] face.î It was not too hot yet in the morning. So, the cyclist was happy and strong. He was confident he could conquer anything. As the day grew on ìthe sun was beginning to beat downî He was beginning to drink lots of water but he was still confident and strong. ìI came to a ramshackle shed [and] several rusty pumps the sight was troubling. ìThe cyclist was travelling in the hot deserts of California. He was becoming tired and thirsty. He had to save as much water as possible. The pumps were dry and added to his despair. What started as a confident ride into the desert became a survival ride. Once the cyclist findswater he is relieved. He feels more confident and can ride to his destination. The weather and setting can affect us emotionally and physically just like in the essay, the cyclist became tired both physically and emotionally as the hot, sunny day went on.
290	6268	3	3	As the cyclist begins his journey, he is confident & exited to have been offered new directions from some ìold wise menî which promise a shortcut. This water supply is mediocre & attitude willed against the flat and hilly terrain, untill he realizes the directions are way off target. The cyclist was making his way to Yosemite when he came to the first ìtownî but it wasn't a town but more of a ghost dwelling, sun-bleached and desolate. As he continued hoping the shortcut offered by the old ìcodgensî would actually materialize, he realized he was utterly alone in the hot desert wt a depleting water supply & dwindling spirit. He was disturbed that he had chosen to follow the advice from the older men and through his his pain & dispair, encouraged himself by deciding he would never listen to their type again. The cyclist felt skrewed over, yet through his will & determination, by rationing water & mentally choosing to cycle for each hill one at a time, he endured his physicall, emotional & mental trials and lived to learn the valuable lesson of never consulting old ì codgersî on mapping issues, because their information would most likely be out datted. His experience underscored the importance of relying on current and reliable resources for navigation.
291	6269	3	3	The whys the setting affected the cyclist is that the hotter it was, the more water that he drank to stay hydrated and regulate his body temperature. Also, the further he traveled, the more tired he got, which caused him to get hotter and expend more energy, which in turn caused him to drink more of his water to replenish his fluids and combat fatigue. Therefore, the environmental temperature and distance directly influenced his hydration needs.
292	6270	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly in his determined ride. At first, he seemed at ease, talking about the cool pines and rushing rivers he was going to encounter once getting to Yosemite. After a strenuous ride, he started to get nervous and wonder if he was even going to survive. He was running out of water, and he thought he saw a diamondback. Once he reached the rolling hills, he saw a posted speed limit sign saying not to exceed the speed limit of 55 m.p.h. He was doing a water-depleting 12 m.p.h., wondering how he was going to survive. At the end of the rolling hills, he came to an old Welch's grape factory, wondering why his life was so cruel. After that, he was determined to survive and make it to his destination. He picked out spokes on the horizon and rode towards them, making his way across the desert. He finally made it to ""Olly and Wilber's Fish Camp,"" where he knew he was safe and would survive. The harsh landscape had tested him, but his resolve ultimately led him to safety."
293	6271	3	3	The hot, dry, and baron setting affect the cyclist greatly. Baron is a hot, dry and abanded place. The cyclist is trying to ride his bike to Yosemite national park. He decides to follow the directions of coaple old men, which was a mistake. The men gave him directions that lead him through Death Valley. “Simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades,”(Kurmaskie). The hot and dry conditions made the cyclists hardest obstacle to be staying hydrated. He had to ration his water carefully under the scorching sun, making his journey even more challenging. Ultimately, the cyclist’s reliance on outdated advice compounded the difficulties posed by the harsh environment.
294	6272	3	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist in many ways. One way was because of the **heat and the terrain**. With the cyclist having limited amount of water effected him to. The cyclist listened to the old men so therefour he traveled a good distance. So that made matters bad. With having lack of water with such distance to go the cyclist stuck pebbles in his mouth hoping to forget about his thirst. The cyclist thought of him dying and the birds picking him clean, because he thought he would die because dehydration. The conditions of the road made it harder, First he started with nothing but straight roads then ended up going up and down hill. In conclusion, the cyclist hit many obstacles that made his trip harder then what he thought.
295	6273	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the setting then you won't had lots on hills. Also, there was no water. For example, in the story, he says it was a hilly area. Also, he says that there are no buildings; he is all by himself, which might make him scared. So the setting affects the cyclist by being a very hot, dry climate with no water and no buildings, and no people to ask for directions would make him scared and lost and fearful of what is going to happen to him, illustrating how the environment significantly impacts his experience and emotions.
296	6274	3	3	"During the cyclist's journey, he was faced with many **challenges**. Mostly the driver **challenges** and out of water. In the essay, it says how he arrived at the first town and was in search of water. It said, ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war."" This affected the cyclist because he was running out of water. Another feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heatstrokes, and not a single car or building the whole way. Therefore the cyclist had to push through many obstacles to reach his destination."
297	6275	3	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because of the bad conditions of the road and the lack of sun, the desolate deserts, and the low amount of energy supply he had left, reasons why he was struggling to maintain his pace and focus.
298	6276	3	3	As if a long bike ride through the city isn’t grueling enough, the author of this story had it much worse. First the climate was a recipe for disaster. “High deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1, the heat, is clearly a debilitating factor as is direct sunlight and low humidity. If the cyclist did not have the proper gear he could be hurt by all three of these factors. Secondly, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS2, this tests his endurance as it is going for tolerance, energy and will power to climb each individual hill. Most importantly, with his lack of water in his bottles, all of these characteristics were harmful. Within a desert, water is to be found nowhere. In hot weather, the water bottles will turn warm and in sunlight, water could even evaporate, leaving the cyclist dehydrated. To me, it seems like the setting and the weather were the perfect combination for doing much more harm than good.
299	6277	3	3	The features that affect the cyclist is the lack of water; he slows down considerably as a result. Another factor is the directions from the old men, which are probably not up to date nowadays, leading to potential detours. These combined issues clearly impede the cyclist's progress.
300	6278	3	3	The setting explains an early summer evening with some eccentric men. The mood that he would be in would probably be lively. ìLike a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their adviceÖî (Kurmaskie) says that if you were very lively, I would take that as a way of being drunk without being drunk, and doing whatever someone thinks you should do without knowing you are being persuaded to do it. This heightened state, fueled by the evening's atmosphere and company, made him susceptible to suggestion, leading him to act against his better judgment the following day, highlighting the dangers of unchecked exuberance.
301	6279	3	3	The setting causes difficult problems for the cyclist and tough hazards. The weather is hot, and just going through hot weather is tough enough, but cycling through a desert with limited water had to be miserable. The warmth of the desert had an affect on the cyclist and caused him to be fatigued. This delayed him from getting to his destination quicker as well. Not only did he have to endure tough weather but hazardous conditions too. There were times when ìtumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snakeî. This delayed him and took time to cycle around. As you can see this was a difficult journey for the cyclist and the setting significantly affected his progress.
302	6280	3	3	The features surrounding the cyclist affect him greatly. All he has around him are hills, rough terraine, sand + tumble weeds. These desolate features leave him thinking he will die because there is no life around him. Everything is dry + vivid + thats how it makes him feel. The old, rusty water pump shows that it hasn’t been used in ages + the black tar pumped out is no help to his negative thought of life, reinforcing his despair as the landscape mirrors his inner turmoil.
303	6281	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Ranging from temperature, surroundings, and the availability of water. First of all, the cyclist felt tired and exhausted because of the temperature and terrain. For example, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I can imagine the cruelty of the heat beating down on him while riding down the roads. It would make me tired and exhausted also. Second of all, the surroundings as he rode affected him and made him have less confidence as he rode further. For example, “This place might have been a thriving little spot some time, say, before the last world war—last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” It shows how the information he had been giving caused him to feel unsure of where he was going. I’d feel uncapable and would do the same in his situation. Lastly, the lack of water made him scared. For example, “conserve my water and go instead for an hour or so a test of my inner spirit.” It made him think the situation wasn’t good. He was clearly rationing his supply, prioritizing it carefully. So as one can see, the setting's elements significantly affected the cyclist in many ways, influencing his physical state, mental fortitude, and overall sense of security.
304	6282	3	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the author uses features of the setting to show the effects on the cyclist. In the essay, the rider gets directions from two old men on a porch. The essay stated, “Never accept braid advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the centers of their porch since Carter was in office.” This shows the old men could be wrong, and places can change. Also, on this shortcut, he almost runs out of water. The essay stated, ""I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so – a test of my inner spirit."" He is running out of water but has the determination to get to @CAPS1; thus, the terrain affects him. The hills prove to be a challenge with a limited supply of water. The essay states, ""Flat roads were upleed by sheed, rolling hills."" This shows he is extremely determined. Even though the hills added to the struggle, he made it through. That is how the author used features of the setting to add to the struggle of the cyclist, highlighting the impact of both unreliable advice and the demanding landscape on the rider's journey."
305	6283	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because they figured that they were old enough and seen what was going on and been through that situation that they were well experienced and knew more about what was going on, so the people should listen to them, feeling entitled to be heard due to their perceived experience within that particular environment.
306	6284	3	3	After the cyclist spoke to the old timers who hadn’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office, his confidence in them began to wane. He entered the desert happy, hopeful, and determined. As his water reservoir began to disappear, and he approached the sight of the old shed, canal and a couple water pumps, he began to feel touched by a sense of foreboding. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps, but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. As he rode on, his confidence only faded more. He travelled through the desert, narrowly avoiding a ridiculously large snake, and was running low on water. Finally he saw a building in the distance, which ironically enough was an abandoned juice factory; a sign featuring a lemon sipping on some succulent icy liquid teased ruin, and he began to lose hope. He didn’t think he would make it to his destination, or anywhere else for that matter. Although after approaching the old factory, he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy was refounded, giving him the strength to continue.
307	6285	3	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist in a few ways. For example, the features of the “Rough Road” didn’t allow him to arrive as fast, so he drove at NUM1 on a NUM2 speed limit. Second, the fact that he was driving through a desert, a large snake made its way onto the road, causing the man to have to ""ease past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" Again, because he was driving through the desert, he got so hot and started to get dehydrated from lack of water. Lastly, the feature that there weren't any buildings for miles left him lost and without anywhere to stop and ask for directions. These few features definitely affected the cyclist and contributed to the challenges he faced on his journey."
308	6286	3	3	There were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist to make his difficult journey to Yosemite. First, it was the old timers at the reservoir campground. They might have been old, but not very wise. For example, ìI followed their advice and launched out at first line, nd along a ëshort cutî that was toslice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.î This is describing how the cyclist takes the short cut from the old timers which almost gets him killed. The shortcut, instead of saving time, led him onto a treacherous path. Second, the sun had a warming affect on the cyclist causing him to dehydrate. For example, ìI had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularlyand I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.î This is showing you an image of just how hot the climate he is in. The relentless sun beat down, intensifying the physical strain of the ride. Finally, a lack of water can cause major problems, such as heatstroke or dehydration, yoth which can lead to death. For example ìI could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in JuneÖî This is stating without enough water to keep him cool he felt as if he were going to die. The combination of poor advice, intense heat, and the constant threat of dehydration made the cyclist’s journey to Yosemite a truly arduous one.
309	6287	3	3	"In the story ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î the setting often affects the character. One example of this is when the character got to a place where there was nothing. ìOne ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnít hold in the lamest mule greeted meî. This quote explains that the cyclist was surprised by the desolation, contributing to his confusion. Another example of this harsh setting is when the water in his bottle feels @NUM1 degrees. ìI was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.î That quote suggests that it is hot outside, which would make the water hot and less refreshing for the cyclist. Another example of the setting is when the terrain changed. ""@CAPS1 road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This made the biker have to work harder, and use more energy to navigate the uneven landscape. These difficult conditions all made the cyclist have to work harder to find his destination, emphasizing the challenging environment he faced."
310	6288	3	3	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,” affected the cyclist greatly. For starters it says he was “traveling through the high desserts” which is never a safe thing. He had been drinking his water regularly but the temperature was rising. He was, “trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state.” From lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into “A tar like substance.” The relentless sun beat down, intensifying the harsh conditions. The arid landscape offered no respite, and the rough road further challenged his endurance. The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist, exacerbating his already precarious situation and pushing him to his physical limits.
311	6289	3	3	The conditions and features affect everything about the cyclist. The conditions were that he had to save as much water as possible and keep himself hydrated at the same time so that he wouldn’t dehydrate himself, a delicate balance to maintain under such strenuous activity. The features of the desert like land were fierce. It was dry and bumpy, not to mention that there were creatures such as snakes on the prowl out there. You can never predict what they’ll do, making every moment a test of vigilance and endurance. These external factors combined to create a uniquely challenging environment that demanded both physical and mental fortitude from the cyclist.
312	6290	3	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when he arrived at the first town, the water tasted like battery acid, which made the rider conserve water. Another is with the harsh conditions such as the temperature, specifically the intense heat that drained his energy. The rider would listen to the old people to try to get to the place he was going faster, hoping their local knowledge would offer shortcuts or easier routes. The setting, therefore, significantly influences the cyclist's decisions and physical state.
313	6291	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. One feature would be the dryness of the land. He was pedaling for such a long time that he became dehydrated, yet there was not a drop of water for he did not know how long and he didn't think he could make it that far. His throat felt like sandpaper, each swallow a painful reminder of his dwindling reserves. Another feature of the setting was the heat. He felt like he could not go on because the heat from the sun made him want to have a heat stroke. The sun beat down mercilessly, radiating off the parched earth and baking him in his cycling gear. Clearly, the features of the setting did greatly impact the cyclist.
314	6292	3	3	During the cyclistís trip, he experienced physical and mental strain. The intense heat, rough terrain, the animals and his isolation all contributed to his strain while completing his challenging task. His isolation while cycling down the ìshortcutî was a definite factor in his strain. @PERSON1 stated that, ì there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.î All @PERSON1 had to focus on was accomplishing his task. There wasnít anybody nearby to help him and there wasnít any shelter for him to take to escape the heat. The heat itself played a very predominant factor in Kurmaskieís physical strain. The heat caused him to become dangerously thirsty and required him to find an abundance of water fast. Kurmaskie stated, ì the growing realization that I could drop from heatstrokeî This statement proves that the intense temperature was a life threatening factor. The rough terrain and snake and two factors in his trip that just helped make his journey even more cruel. The physical strain of avoiding a snake in the middle of the road and the dangerous terrain just put him in a more grading position. The combination of these elements created a truly arduous experience for the cyclist. Ultimately, the cyclist's journey was a testament to both human endurance and the impact of environmental factors on one's well-being.
315	6293	3	3	"In Joe Kurmaskieís, ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. First of all, the cyclist is dehydrated from the heat and lack of water. ìI eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""This sentence from the text shows he is dehydrated, because of this it creates an obstacle he must face. The relentless sun beating down contributes to this dehydration. Also, another bad affect from the features of the setting the cyclist is facing is, the rough road ahead he had to face. ìROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXcEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.î If I were the cyclist gazing at the sign I would die just knowing there was trouble up ahead. The warning itself signals discomfort and potential difficulty. Luckily the cyclist made his way through and managed his obstacles well. Despite these challenges, the cyclist's perseverance allowed him to overcome the harsh environment."
316	6294	3	3	There are many features in the setting that will affect the cyclists. One feature is the climate. When you are cycling and it is really hot you can dehydrate very fast, impacting performance and potentially leading to heatstroke. If it is really cold it is harder to breath and catch your breath, which can strain the respiratory system. Another feature in the setting that can affect a cyclist is the terrain. If there are too many hills that are really steep than you will get very tired quickly, depleting energy reserves. When it is rocky you have a posablity to fall off the bike and hurt yourself, causing injuries that could range from scrapes to more serious fractures. Last feature in the setting that will affect a cyclist is how isolated the road is. If a cyclist runs out of water and there are no places to stop on the road, this could be almost deadly to a cyclist, potentially leading to severe dehydration and heat exhaustion. Also if the road is so isolated and you get hurt who would find you. This is another deadly situation because timely medical assistance would not be available. These are the main features in the setting that can affect the cyclist, highlighting the importance of preparation and awareness for a safe journey.
317	6295	3	3	The features at the setting affected the cyclist by dehydrating him. The setting had a hot sun, no trees, and no water. The cyclist was also feeling lazy. In the story he said “I and the growing dizziness worried me, that I could drop from heat stroke.”
318	6296	3	3	The setting was hot and dry, which affected the cyclist greatly. She didn’t have enough space to carry a lot of water and no rod to make portions to drink. Also, listening to old guys who didn’t know much didn’t help either and sent her on a much harder path to travel; their advice proved useless in the harsh terrain, further depleting her limited resources and energy. Consequently, her journey became significantly more challenging.
319	6297	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. The first was the cool forested road that he set out on. Since the route was not easy, he felt confident and started heading in the wrong direction. Another factor was when he rode into the desert. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated, and what little water he could find tasted like battery acid, further weakening him. These factors affected the cyclist by giving him false hope early on and nearly leading him to his death in the harsh desert environment.
320	6298	3	3	The way the setting of the story help the guy out alot. He was riding and it was hot, but with the cool pines and Risum River it was worth the ride. The shade from the pines offered respite from the sun, and the nearby river likely provided a cooling breeze. It keep him cool so he could get his water in the next town. That is why I think that the pines and river were a big help to his journey.
321	6299	3	3	Whether the lack of water, the hills, the tumble weeds – all are things that affect the cyclist. The lack of water affects the cyclist because it is hot outside and he needs water to stay hydrated. The hills also affect him because it is hard to peddle up hills, demanding more energy. Finally is the tumbleweeds. The tumble weeds show a distinct desert look. When he sees tumble weeds he tries to keep balance because he is partially dehydrated and doesn’t want to crash, risking injury. The dehydration / lack of water affect the author because he is very thirsty and everyone needs water to survive and maintain physical function. When you are lack of water and energy it makes your goal more hard to complete, turning a challenging ride into a potentially dangerous ordeal. Therefore, these environmental factors significantly compound the cyclist's difficulties, highlighting the importance of preparation and awareness.
322	6300	3	3	In ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by gradually wearing him out and pushing his limits of hope and survival skills. At first, the cyclist enters a deserted town but he remains calm and amused by this in the sentence, ìI chuckled, check my water supply, and moved onî. Soon after, the cyclist is troubled by a ìramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, through the high deserts of California in Juneî. He is agitated by this, makes a significant dent in his water supply, and unfortunately continues onward, battling the harsh environment. At the point where he is still isolated and lost beyond repair, the cyclist tries to stay hopeful but soon breaksdown. He reflects, ìTelling myself that of I could make it that far, Iíd be goldenî. The features of the setting become more and more disappointing at each leg of the journey for the cyclist, ultimately eroding his initial optimism and highlighting the unforgiving nature of his surroundings.
323	6301	3	3	In the beginning of the cyclist's journey, he is very happy and carefree. The cyclist comes to the first deserted town; the setting isn’t described because the cyclist is not worried yet. After leaving the first town, the cyclist barely noticed the heat because, ìthe cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.î The cyclist still has high spirits. The cyclist begins to get thirsty when he comes upon a water pump. He attempts to get water but the pump isn’t in working condition. Until this point in the story the road has been mostly flat and straight. Then the cyclist notices that the road has some hills in it. At this point the cyclist has no water and is very dehydrated. After one hill the cyclist sees a building. The building is an abandoned grape juice factory, which is ironic considering the state the cyclist is in. The cyclist sucks on rocks as a last resort and gives up hope of living, when he comes upon a fish camp. He gets water from the bathroom and all is well. The setting in this story affects the cyclist because as the setting changes, so do the cyclist's moods and feelings about survival and the danger he is in. Thus, the external environment directly shapes the cyclist's internal state, highlighting the powerful connection between setting and character experience.
324	6302	3	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When in the essay it states, ìThe sun was beginning to beat downî This shows that this affects how he feels when he is cycling through the road and this can affect his ability to keep cycling while the sun beats on him hard. Also when he states ìI was doing a water-depleting 12 mph,î this shows he was also dehydrated, going very slow because of the amount of heat and lack of water that affected his ability to keep cycling in the area. These environmental factors clearly presented challenges that impacted his speed and overall experience.
325	6303	3	3	I believe the cyclist is alone, and I think the old man should have shot him. I believe a bike ride that long is a little retarded. I feel that no matter how great or horrible the shape you're in, you shouldn't even go on a really long ride on a bicycle. It seems an unnecessary risk, frankly, and the cyclist's solitude only amplifies the potential dangers. Therefore, the old man's reaction, while extreme, stems from a certain logic, and the foolishness of such an extended ride is clear.
326	6304	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a big way during his journey. The temperature being so hot tired the cyclist and made him thirsty, requiring him to ration his water carefully. Also the hills being so high to ride up made it hard to continue, forcing him to slow his pace. Since he was in the desert there were not many towns to go to, increasing the distance between opportunities to restock supplies. All these factors affected the cyclist on his journey, creating a challenging and demanding experience overall.
327	6305	3	3	The setting in the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” significantly impacts the cyclist in three ways. First, the barren landscape offers no shade, intensifying the sun's relentless heat on his body, exacerbating dehydration and hindering his focus. Another way the setting affects the cyclist is the challenging terrain. The rolling hills and arid desert environment force him to exert more energy, rapidly depleting his water supply. The desert, with its oppressive heat, also plays tricks on his mind, making him question his perceptions and wonder if he sees mirages. Lastly, the ghost towns he encounters raise false hopes of finding water and respite from the heat; however, these abandoned settlements offer nothing, leaving him crestfallen and contemplating death. Thus, the unforgiving setting acts as a major antagonist, both physically and mentally, pushing the cyclist to his limits and shaping his desperate journey.
328	6306	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is hot and dry in the California desert when you are on a bicycle; being hot and dry with bad directions in a desert is bad. It was a long distance ride, under the burning hot sun, with little water, which compounded the challenges. He thought he was going to die because there was nothing in sight, and the harsh environment pushed him to his physical and mental limits. The desert's unforgiving nature significantly influenced his struggle for survival.
329	6307	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more ways than one. For example in the short story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist had to endure going over big dirt hills while being dehydrated and tired from biking miles and miles to get to a destination. The harsh landscape demanded significant physical exertion. The setting can sometimes even cause you to lose hope and give up. The cyclist in the short story started to lose hope until he found a store that sold fishing bait. This unexpected discovery provided a much-needed morale boost. The setting controls how long it takes you to get to your destination and how you get there. For example, if you come across a dirt road and there's a big boulder in the way, you have to find another way to get there. This detour could add significant time and effort to the journey. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, influencing their physical endurance, mental state, and overall route."
330	6308	3	3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the California desert in June without water. He is also cycling up and down curvy, hilly back roads. The cyclist eventually starts to lose water and his determination is tested as he struggles to get to the next town. He says ìwide rings of dried sweet circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some old gentlemen who hadnít been off their porch in decades. Caused me to lough.î The author is showing how the circumstances he is in are taking a toll on him, both physically and mentally. He also states a road sign ìRough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.î This is ironic because he is already exhausted and now he is about to encounter a treacherous stretch of road. I have never cycled for long periods of time and can hardly imagine being pushed to such a state of exhaustion. I can relate it to a time I played @NUM1 soccer games during the summer heat. It was painful and every time I received the ball it took all I had to tackle it, much like the cyclist's struggle against the relentless desert and arduous terrain. This makes me realize the significance of how external factors can dramatically impact one's mental and physical endurance.
331	6309	3	3	In the story the features of the setting effect him because he was running out of water. He also had to maneuver around a snake that slithered across his path unexpectedly. It made him tired and dehydrated. His muscles got sore from the rough terrain underfoot. He got dehydrated from the relentless sun beating down. The scarcity of water combined with the harsh environment pushed him to his physical limits, highlighting the setting's direct impact on his well-being.
332	6310	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways because it's almost like the background and theme of the cyclist. The features used in this story are mostly about the background in which he is going and the sites of where he is. He's showing the reader of how much he needs somewhere to go and also how much he's in despair at the time. When he says ""It was sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself,"" he is saying that he might be tired and physically not be in his best shape but at least he knows he's not in a good shape and he knows he's in trouble, but he can still laugh it off and is aware but he keeps trying anyways. This text, in my opinion, is showing many different ideas such as hope, awareness, and ability and courage to realize you need help but go on anyways to prove to yourself you can finish what you wanted and planned to do, highlighting the cyclist's resilience in the face of adversity."
333	6311	3	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is a dessert. The dessert is very hot. I know this because in the story, he states that it feels around @NUM1 degrees. He struggled for water but couldnít find any that was cool. He found a water pump that had ""a tar like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.î This means it was hot and couldnít find water, further exacerbating his dehydration and discomfort as he continues his journey."
334	6312	3	3	Many hazards and rigorous features affect the cyclist. He starts off his journey with the advice of a short cut from old men. The cyclist is very excited about the thought of a short cut and is drinking his water effectliy. Soon he begins to run lost and the sun begins to beat down on him. He take pressure in thinking about the cool stress of a nearby stream and is then not bothered by the sun even the imaginary setting of fictious stream had an effect on the cyclist. Soon the sun starts to beat on him even more. The cyclist starts to run out of water and he makes sure the vivid he comes across is not a mirage. When he come over the bend he cave to his troubles road and thirst, ultimately succumbing to the harsh conditions.
335	6313	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist persevered through the rough terrain which caused him to become weak. For example, the author states ""I looked at the majority of the pavement in front of me and ceased past tilling to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This shows the author is dehydrated because it is so hot, and he kept going even with a physical obstacle like the difficult pavement. Another thing that affected the author was that he felt like giving up because the terrain was too harsh and unforgiving. For instance in the text, ""it didn't really matter I was going to die and the birds will pick me cleary waveng only some experience outdoor gears."" This shows that the author still had to go even when time gets tough, battling the urge to quit. The text shows how exhausted he is by the winds eating at him when he dies. He would dehydrate due to the humidity of the desert and heat. In other words, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways, pushing him to his physical and mental limits."
336	6314	3	3	The features of the setting affect a cyclist because if you are going downhill and then hit a rough road, you are not going to do so good. Like, for example, if he had been going on flat land, then it changed to hills, lastly into a rough road; these conditions could seriously hurt someone, especially if the cyclist is unprepared for the sudden change in terrain or doesn't have the right equipment. Therefore, being aware of the setting is important for a cyclist's safety.
337	6315	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a couple different ways. When the cyclist found the ghost town, since no one was there, he could not ask someone for better directions or get some food or water to replenish his energy. The short, rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is difficult to gain momentum going uphill and then maintain it. At the end of the story, he found a bait shop where he got water and better directions, ultimately helping him continue his journey with renewed resources and a clearer path.
338	6316	3	3	The features of the setting affects the setting by all the big hills, and all the roughness of the roads. As the essay says ''flatroad was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I crested the first few of these a large highway sigh jumped out at me,î prety much what it is saying is the flat road soon turned into rolling hills. If I was the cyclist riding up the hills my legs would get very tired and sore after a while one example, is when my friend ,@PERSON1, and I went bike riding, we went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, in fechmisburg, and we had to ride up a big hill, so after a few pedals our legs started hurting, so we decided to just walk go the hill. This illustrates how challenging terrain can quickly alter a cyclist's experience and necessitate a change in approach.
339	6317	3	3	"There are many ways in which the setting of “Rough Road Ahead” affects the cyclist. First of all, he is bicycling through the desert. This poses a problem because it is very dry and hot. At one point in the story, the author writes that he was “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” It is obvious here that lack of water is affecting him in a big way. He almost collapsed because he is so thirsty and struggling with the intense heat. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is that he is in a very remote area. He says that “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" Since there was rolling now, the cyclist had to keep cycling and drinking his water until he could find a place to stop and rest. Lastly, the “rough road” affected the cyclist. The road made traveling even harder to do and caused the cyclist to have a very rough time due to constant jolting. If I had to bicycle for a long period of time, I would much rather have a smooth road so I could renew my energy more efficiently. The heat, remoteness of the area, and the rough road all affected the cyclist on his journey, making it a truly challenging experience."
340	6318	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly in the story. The harsh desert climate takes its toll on the cyclist by quickly depleting his water supply under the blazing sun. He also began to get worried when every town the old men told about turned out to be a ghost town, abandoned and desolate. This crawled doubt in the cyclist's mind that he might not survive the “shortcut” told off by the old men, as the environment itself seemed to conspire against him.
341	6319	3	3	The features in the setting effects the cyclist because there it different kinds of hills. He has watch out for rocks in the middle of the road. He has to make sure he has a lot of water because it looks like he is in the desert. There is no cars around but he still has to look for any cars in case they came out of nowhere. There is a lot of turns. It is very hot so he has to make sure he does not have a neat scaoke. There is no places where he can stop because there is no shade. There is no stores where he can stop & get water and food at either. That is the setting of the cyclist, and all these factors demand careful planning and constant vigilance to ensure a safe and successful ride.
342	6320	3	3	The story the condition of the problem often affected the mood of the cyclist. For example when the sign said, ‚Äù Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,‚Äù this time he saw a snake; he was scared, so he eased past, trying to keep balance while he was dehydrated. The dry and hot climate began to become a problem for the cyclist, compounding his challenges and further influencing his state of mind.
343	6321	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he could have tried to drink the battery taste water if he didn't get enough clean water on time. Driving a bike on in a long distance, with no water or any other supplies, is very energy consuming, especially in harsh weather conditions. So you have to plan trips like that very wisely, considering factors like the availability of resources and potential environmental challenges, to ensure a safe and successful journey.
344	6322	3	3	In the story, the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The cyclist, pedaling through California, is obviously very hot in the beautiful summer sun. He also runs out of water, which nearly dooms him. But that’s not the worst of it. The hills make him run out of water and energy even quicker. There are also no places to stop for water. The cyclist is lucky he survived the rugged terrain of California.
345	6323	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. If he wasn’t in “High deserts of California in June” he probably wouldn’t be dehydrated; if he was in December, it wouldn’t be so hot out. Also, if there weren’t “short rolling hills” he would have had more energy, and the terrain would be easier to navigate. As you can see, setting affects the cyclist a lot.
346	6324	3	3	There were many features that affected the cyclist. Lack of water slowed him down, causing dehydration and muscle cramps. Also the hills and sun were a big problem, increasing his exertion and leading to overheating. These combined factors significantly impacted his overall performance.
347	6325	3	3	"In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting had a great deal to do with the cyclist. The roads were bumpy, windy, and had many hills. As the effect of that, the cyclist had to drink a lot of water. As the cyclist rode into the so-called town he found nothing, as he says “I began to pump the old rusted water pump, but nothing came out except nasty blackish water."" The unforgiving landscape, therefore, directly influenced the cyclist's physical strain and desperation for basic necessities."
348	6326	3	3	The way the features of the setting effect the cyclist in what was, going through hot neighborhoods and very road that made her dehydrated and effected her journey including the long cycling which he had to go up. This arduous cycling, combined with the relentless heat radiating from the neighborhoods, swiftly led to dehydration, impacting her stamina and overall performance as she continued up the long, challenging road.
349	6327	3	3	In the story, the cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that he can complete the whole ride. But after he left the first town he had been riding and needed water, so he stopped at a fork in the road to get water from a pump, which tasted like battery acid. Then, as he progressed further in his trip, he came to a sign that said, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limit” (Joe Kurmaskie pg @NUM1). This part of his trip proved very challenging by making him face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross, which quickly depleted his water supply. Then, as he came over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gas station. So when he arrived, he bought some water and got directions from a man who possessed the best map. So you can see that going over all the mountains sucks all the water out of the cyclist, so he was understandably relieved when he finally obtained water at the end.
350	6328	3	3	The features of the setting in the essay entitled ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî affect the cyclist in an antagonizing manner. He is dehydrated and exhausted due to the conditions of the environment he was in. The cyclist became dehydrated because of not only a lack of water, but also the scorching heat of the desert. He sweat so much to the point that he lost an enormous amount of bodily fluids, leaving him weak and vulnerable. The cyclist also was traveling on an unpaved road which required more energy than traveling on one that is paved. Therefore the cyclist became so exhausted that he almost died, his body pushed to its absolute limit by the demanding terrain. These are the ways the harsh environment the cyclist was in significantly affected him, bringing him to the brink of collapse.
351	6329	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in ways of feeling doubtful, confidence, determination and relief. For example he feels doubtful when he has hardly any water and has no clue where he is or where he is going to end up, lost in the vast landscape. He first felt confident when the old people on the porch told him how to go, providing a sense of direction, and then at the end when he says he will listen to his map next time, suggesting a regained assurance. He was also was determined because he wanted to get to the next town which he does, fueled by the challenge of the terrain. That also makes him relived, a sense of accomplishment washing over him, and wants to get to Yosemite National Park. That is how the setting affects the cyclist, shaping his emotional state and influencing his actions throughout his journey.
352	6330	3	3	"The features of the setting in which the cyclist is in change his outlook on the trip. When he first begins his trip, the road is fine, so he becomes confident. When the terrain began to change, he writes, ìsometimes life can feel so cruelî, he grows despairing as he faces new terrain with so little water. When he begins to see a building, he becomes hopeful and determined. However, when he realizes its old juice factory, he grows bitter. When he leaves the factory, he feels stripped of all hope. The comparison can be shown when he writes, ìsomehow i climbed away from the abandoned factory of of juice and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" In the end, when he is revived with water he almost looks back on the journey comically. The rider knows that his outlook drastically changed depending on setting through his journey, demonstrating how powerfully our environment shapes our emotional state."
353	6331	3	3	The features of California and the fact that the cyclist was near Yosemite made the terrain rugged and dangerous to the cyclist. California has a very hot climate and is near a desert, so the need for water for the cyclist was much greater than if he had been cycling in @LOCATION1. In the story, the cyclist had to travel through desert-like conditions with a limited water supply, intensifying the challenge. The cyclist even mentioned in the story how many hours into the ride the land changed to “short, rolling hills,” which would have made it harder to pedal and made him work harder; in the story, he also mentioned how the sun was beating down on him, and that would also serve as a factor that helped deplete his hydration. Through all of the problems the cyclist faced, however, he managed to stay determined, when other people faced with his problems might not have been able to make it through. Also, in the story, you @MONTH1 notice that in the different stages of his struggle, the author's tone changed from confident to unsure to desperate, showing the psychological toll of the demanding environment. Ultimately, the cyclist's persistence highlights the impact of challenging terrain and climate on physical and mental endurance.
354	6332	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The relentless sun beat down, and the rough, uphill terrain tested his endurance, contributing to his fatigue. The arid landscape offered no water source, leaving him thirsty. The combination of heat, arduous path, and dehydration meant he was near exhaustion.
355	6333	3	3	The cyclist in the essay ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî took the advice of older gentlemen who offered him a shortcut they knew to get to Yosemite national park. However, the land had changed long ago after these men were last here. The first town he came upon was a realistic version of a ghost town, buildings boarded up and paint peeling. He laughed at how long ago those men must have been here. Long hours on the hot road and with depleted water, exhaustion sank in. He lost almost all hope when he reached an old and destroyed grape juice factory, the rusted machinery a testament to forgotten industry. He had made it to a bait store for water at last, the cool liquid reviving him. He would never take the advice of anyone but his map again.
356	6334	3	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist by letting the author have hope. When he came across a sign which read ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" his hope was faint because he was doing a water-depleting @NUM1 per hour. Because of the rate of the water, he felt life was cruel sometimes and he thought that he was at the point of losing water. Also when he came across the tumbleweeds and the large snake he tried to avoid them, wary of the potential danger they posed. If he would have been bitten he would have died. Finally because of the heat he might have also did from the heatstroke ""wide signs of dried"", emphasizing the harshness and potential lethality of the environment, solidifying the idea that the setting profoundly shaped his desperate situation."
357	6335	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” many features of the setting challenge the cyclist. The cyclist accepts information from foreign old people, which made his first mistake. After realizing this he stated, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California, in June.” The lack of water plus the heat in California in June would have turned to heatstroke for most people. Even further into the journey, even with all those things against him, it states, “flat rode was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This change in elevation adds to the physical strain. Not only did he have excessive heat and no water, but he was handed troublesome roads too. Although the cyclist must have been near to complete exhaustion, he continued through, fighting all odds and elements; many features in the setting of this story affected the cyclist, but he overcame them honorably.
358	6336	3	3	"The dry, desert-like setting would affect the cyclist because he could easily become dehydrated from the sun and loss of water through sweat. The cyclist states, ìI eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated stateî (Rough Road Ahead). The man is badly dehydrated, but in his determination, he moves on, despite the harsh conditions exacerbating his physical state. The terrain went from being flat to short, rolling hills, further increasing the exertion required. The road had been abandoned, along with the town he had passed through, hoping to get water, highlighting the desolation. The man goes on to say, ì I toiled on, at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me ""(Rough Road Ahead). The setting is obviously desert-like, so it is dry, hot, and dusty, which compounds the challenges. This would definitely have an effect on his body, which is sweating, which causes dehydration due to water loss. In conclusion, the cyclist was greatly affected by the setting, which presented both physical and environmental obstacles to his journey."
359	6337	3	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist quite durastrely. First of all, he was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The sun beat down relentlessly. He was running out of water and the pump he found only produced “brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees “and” had the flavor of battery acid.” Then he came upon “rolling hills” and “Rough @CAPS1.” Each hill sapped his strength, and the rough terrain jarred his bones. By the end, he was exhausted, dehydrated, and in desperate need of water. The terrain made the story more meaning full in proving that you shouldn’t get directions from old guys.
360	6338	3	3	"In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist encountered several problems. The main conflict of the cyclist in this text is the lack of water. Cycling is a vigorous exercise and can take much strength out of a rider. Water is neccesary to make sure the cyclist stays hydrated. In the text, the old men had the cyclist take a detour through desert areas and hilly terains. Because of the hot weather and rough roads the cyclist became dehydrated faster than normal. For example, the text says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tentalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatsroke on a gorgeouse day in June."" Here, by usings vocubulary such as ""tentalizing"" expresses the cyclist need for water. Furthermore, later in the sentence the narrator make a reference to the old men, giving the blame entirely to them for them suggesting the path. Readers can also can conclude that the harsh setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist. Because the cyclist was not prepared for the dry heat, they struggled to retain water while riding uphill. The conflict in the story emphasizes the cyclist's difficult journey and the critical need for hydration during intense physical activity."
361	6339	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his travel a lot harder. The weather was very hot, making him very thirsty, and due to the towns being abandoned, he could not stock up on water. The terrain that he had to cross had many hills, and the road was not in good condition, slowing his progress. With the heat, lack of water, ghost towns, and tough terrains, his journey was a very hard achievement to overcome. With all these obstacles in his way, he was able to achieve his goal of getting water, showing his determination against a challenging environment.
362	6340	3	3	"The story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie was about a man traveling through some pretty difficult settings. The cyclist’s mood was determined by the setting as well as his needs and his determination to make it. The setting of the story early summer in California. The weather is described as hot as, ""The sun [began] to beat down."" He, ""was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" Because of the excessive heat, he needed more water, which shortly became the conflict of this story, as his supply dwindled under the scorching sun. As things got more difficult his attitude towards the old men’s advice changed from gracious for their help to wishing he had never listened to them, especially as the promised water source proved unreliable. Also as the difficulty increased his determination to move on also increased by, ""telling [himself] if [he] could make it that far, [he'd] be fine."" Ultimately, for the cyclist, the setting's affect was negative, shaping his journey and influencing his emotional state throughout the challenging ride."
363	6341	3	3	In the story ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î there are many features that affected the cyclist. For example, ìThe sun was beginning to beat down,î meaning they were starting to get hot and tired. Then when he came to all the bumps in the road, it was harder to pedal. He was also drinking his bottle of water hard, signifying he's hot, getting tired, and lost. ìI got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strengthî tells us he’s working too hard, meaning heíll be worn out to ride. All of these environmental and physical challenges combined clearly demonstrate the reasons why these various features significantly affected the cyclist's journey.
364	6342	3	3	"First, the old men affect the cyclist by throwing him off track. They do this by telling him of a ""shortcut"" that will take him right to his destination. Then the cyclist was faced with rough, rolling hills of a highway. Over his long journey, the cyclist still remained determined to reach his destination, despite the unexpected challenges he faced."
365	6343	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. If the cyclist was riding his bike in Maine in the middle of June he wouldnít of gotten so dehydrated. This biker is riding in the high deserts of California that reach to 110 degrees. In the middle of December in Maine it bearly reaches 30 degrees. Also the desert is know to have nothing. If he was riding somewhere else every mile there could be a gas station. Although this cyclist is riding in ìNo Manís Landî. Lastly the roads in the desert are a lot more dangerous, since people never really drive through, no one really comblains regularly about pot holes and stuff. They are more worried about the cities were many people travel, there is no point to change or fill pot holes where no one really travels, highlighting how location drastically shapes the cyclist's experience.
366	6344	3	3	"The setting really takes determination away from the cyclist. There were hills that made his ride difficult. It says, ""over one long crippling hill, a building came into view."" This shows the hills were hard on him because he says they were long and crippling. Another thing in the setting was the building. He was extremely thirsty and because he came to an abandoned grape juice factory it said, ""by the looks of it, had been a Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant."" The factory's abandonment further emphasizes the desolation and lack of immediate relief for his thirst. These were two of several examples of the setting affecting the cyclist, ultimately highlighting how the challenging environment diminishes his resolve."
367	6345	3	3	The features of the setting have a major affect on the cyclist. It is a very hot day and he is in a desert in California with a limited water supply. The sun beats down mercilessly, reflecting off the sand and baking the earth. It starts becoming very hot, and his water supply begins to decrease quickly, each sip feeling less and less sufficient. The old men who he says ìhave not left their porch since @PERSON1 was in officeî gave him very wrong directions to Yosemite and he ended up getting lost out in a hot California desert, with the relentless heat adding to his disorientation. He eventually came to a fishing store where he refreshed with alot of water from the sink, gulping it down gratefully, and then was off again on his way to Yosemite, the memory of the desert spurring him onward. The harsh environment severely impacted his journey, highlighting the importance of accurate information and sufficient resources when facing the elements.
368	6346	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a big way because roads had bottles in them that could have caused him to get really hurt or get a flat tire. Also, the water he was drinking from his water bottle was streaming hot and tasted like battery acid due to the heat intensifying the plastic taste. Then came some rolling hills which would be another big challenge for him, requiring extra energy and stamina. The setting was pretty barren for the cyclist because he also came across a snake slithering across the road, adding a psychological element of fear and danger. Last, he thought he saw some mirages that tell me that the climate is extreme for the cyclists, with the intense heat playing tricks on his eyes. That’s how the setting affects the cyclist, creating physical challenges, potential hazards, and mental strain.
369	6347	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for a few reasons. One reason is that it makes it easier to picture how the cyclist feels, allowing us to empathize with their struggle against the elements. Also it makes the cyclist seem a bit insane for doing what heís doing in weather that he could, ìdrop from heatstroke.î The extreme conditions highlight the cyclist's determination, or perhaps recklessness. The weather is affecting the cyclist so bad that heís seeing a mirage of a ìbuilding-abandoned years ealier.î This hallucination underscores the severity of the heat and its impact on the cyclist's mind. The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the conditions seem impossible to make it in, emphasizing the magnitude of the challenge they are undertaking and creating a sense of awe or disbelief in the reader.
370	6348	3	3	Throughout the story, the cyclist describes the hot weather and harsh terrains of the Midwest in his quest to find a source of water. He notes several times about the nice morning breeze, which offers him a brief respite, but quickly warms into sweltering heat as he pedals along. He also goes into detail about the change from flat ground to rolling hills on his journey. These aspects make the grueling ride that much more difficult for the cyclist and give the reader a vivid image of what he is going through. Supplementing the image of unrelenting heat, the changing landscape further complicates his journey, illustrating the arduous conditions he faces in his search for water.
371	6349	3	3	In the article ìDo not exceed the posted speed limit,î the features of the setting took toll on the cyclist in many ways. First off the whole setting was a dry, dusty desert that would challenge anybody. ìThe sun was beginning to beat down, but i borely noticed it.î The environment affected the cyclist by dehydrating him so much, which brings me to the next point. ìI had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and i was traveling through the high deserts of california in June.î This caused him to become even more dehydrated, resulting in him thinking he was going to die. Along the way he found an old abandoned juice factory. This affected him by filling him with despair and hopelessness, causing him to push more and more to reach water. In the end the features of the setting ultimately fueled his determination to reach water, highlighting the powerful impact of environment on human resilience.
372	6350	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way was the weather. In the story it said “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie). That quote said he is in a desert and deserts are usually warm. It also said in June and June is usually a hot temp month. The weather affected the cyclist because it was hot, which the story later describes, and he started to become dehydrated and had little water. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was the surroundings. In the story it said, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind” (Kurmaskie). That says there's no one around to help him if he gets hurt or needs assistance. Also, there's nowhere nearby to replenish his water supply, compounding the problem of dehydration and highlighting the isolation of his location. Thus, the harsh desert environment significantly impacted the cyclist's well-being and increased the difficulty of his journey.
373	6351	3	3	Many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The most obvious and direct feature would be that this adventure took place in the “high deserts of California in June.” Considering that passage says blistering heat; high meaning it's going to be closer to the sun, deserts, where the world is hot, California, which can be smoggy, and June, which is the middle of summer, the cyclist would be contending with intense solar radiation and minimal shade. Also, the closest water supply was “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,” rendering it undrinkable without significant cooling. There was a “long crippling hill” to climb, all while the sun was beating down. All of that would most obviously affect the cyclist by making him tired, which he vividly explains by expressing his fears of losing consciousness, highlighting the very real danger of heatstroke and exhaustion in such an environment.
374	6352	3	3	In the story, ìDo not exceed posted speed limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is when the cyclist says ìI noticed the terrain changing, Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î This affects the cyclist because it makes him work harder when he is dying of thirst, especially on a hot summer day. It makes his muscles work harder and use his strength more. In the summer time it is extremely hot. When the cyclist is biking it is very hot, he says ìÖ in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.î After this quote he is explaining the difficulty of getting frustrated and thereís no cold water. This affects the cyclist and makes him think about water, not bothering to think about where he is; he could be lost. He didnít have a good map to begin with, and the heat and thirst only compound his navigational challenges. Therefore, the oppressive heat and changing landscape directly impact the cyclist’s physical and mental state, highlighting how the setting becomes an antagonist in his journey.
375	6353	3	3	As the cyclist goes on his trip, he is met with many dreary places and people. For starters, the old men he knew he shouldn't have trusted but did anyway. This led him through the desert. Even in a car the desert can be a very despairing place. On a bicycle it must be even worse knowing that if you run out of water no one will be there to save you from dehydration. Just the endlessly bleak landscapes also played a role in the cyclist's feelings. Another bad feature is the endless amount of abandoned towns and spoiled water. Every time he thought he was saved he was put down again by that fact. For example he had to pump for minutes only to get bad tasting water, only a tease of hope. Finally just when his strength was about to give out he found the bait place & water and that dramatically improved his mood and a place to rest too bad there was another old man there, isn't it?! It seems the cyclist's journey is fated to be filled with disappointment.
376	6354	3	3	In the essay, the features of the cyclist affect the setting because the readers wouldn't have thought that he was in that bad of danger if he hadn't been going through the desert. When the cyclist got to the grape factory, he stated that he was almost dehydrated, suggesting the harshness of the environment had taken its toll. And then, when he got to the bait shop, he drank from the faucet, further emphasizing the cyclist's desperate need for water due to the arid conditions. These details highlight how the cyclist's condition directly reflects and is affected by the severity of the desert setting.
377	6355	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there were rolling hills that went up and down, and it took a lot of strength. Also, he barely had water because it was so hot he kept drinking and ran out of water early. In the story it says when he was riding that “He barely noticed that the sun was starting to beat down.” This quote shows it was starting to get hot, increasing his thirst. Also, in the story he says “I checked my water supply,” which means he’s starting to realize his water is running short, adding to his worry. So in all, the setting is hot and has no water source, and the rolling hills require exertion, so the cyclist is being affected by all of this.
378	6356	3	3	Setting was an important factor in the story. I was in a desert, a place where there is a lack of water. And I was on a bike, which is dangerous because you are using your feet to move, which takes out energy and uses water from your body, making the already scarce resource even more critical to conserve.
379	6357	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was biking up hills in extreme heat. He also had a short water supply while headed in the wrong direction, further increasing his dehydration and disorientation under the scorching sun. Thus, the harsh environment severely hampered his progress.
380	6358	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The directions given to the cyclist by the elderly were incorrect, and he got lost along unfamiliar roads. The lack of water led to the possibility of sucking pebbles to forget about his thirst and the increasing dryness in his mouth. The rolling hills caused the cyclist to use more energy as he constantly adjusted his gears and pedaled harder. These were the affects the setting had to the cyclist, ultimately impacting his journey and physical state.
381	6359	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. The sun beat down, and the road stretched endlessly. When she biked around a bend, ìmy troubles, thirsts, and fear were all behind me.î The sudden shade and a gentle breeze offered immediate relief.
382	6360	3	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist set out on a bike ride in the heat of summer in California where he would be staying. He met some old people who gave him a ""short cut."" As he found out, most of the places he was told about were abandoned ghost towns without a single drop of drinkable water. If he were in a different setting, like by a river or spring, he would just stop and drink from that. Or even if he was in a more populated, industrialized area, he could stop in any building and ask for a drink; but he was in the dry, hot, abandoned hills of California without any water. The sun beat down mercilessly, baking the earth and reflecting the heat back up at him. Under these conditions, he grew tired, thirsty, dehydrated, and desperate for a drink; finally, he came upon a bait shop that had water there, a welcome sight after his ordeal. The bait shop offered not just water, but also a brief respite from the relentless sun, marking a turning point in his challenging journey."
383	6361	3	3	During the cyclist's journey, he was affected by the setting frequently. When he was cycling, it became very hot to him, but at first, it wasn’t so bad. “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely Noticed it.” This proves that the cyclist knows it was getting hot, but it did not affect him initially. Another thing that affected him was the time that he was traveling in. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high deserts in California in June.” This proves that the cyclist was constantly drinking because of the time of day and year he was out, implying he was trying to combat the heat. All of this shows that the setting affected the cyclist on his ride.
384	6362	3	3	I think that the features of the setting really do affect the way someone rides a bike because certain places have certain terrain. Some types are not always good for a bike rider because if it's bumpy, then someone could fall off the bike, especially if they're going fast. Also, if it is dark, you might not even be able to see where you are going, then you could hurt yourself very seriously, perhaps breaking a bone or getting a concussion. That's why riding a bike can be dangerous. Also, if you're in the type of environment where everything is smooth, like a paved bike path, then you might be able to have a nice, safe bike ride.
385	6363	3	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by changing him physically. He was in the California desert in the middle of June without any water left. This was taking a physical toll on him. His physical effect was making him feel hopeless as well. He says, “It was a sad hopeless laugh mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself."" So the way he was suffering from dehydration physically effected his emotional state because he felt as though there was nothing he could do. Had he been in another place, for example a forest in Oregon, where it does not get nearly as hot as Southern California, he would not have been suffering from dehydration, nor have been in such an isolated place. His cycling could be compared to the climbers who were lost in the snow storm in the Himalayas. Instead of dehydration and heat stroke, however they suffered from hypothermia. Had they been on a different mountain, there would have been no snow storm and they would be fine. The outcome of this story and the climbers was determined by their setting, showing how crucial the environment is to the experiences within it."
386	6364	3	3	"The conditions gave the cyclist no hope at some points because the heat of the land and the features of the setting were so harsh he had no hope, like when the cyclist says, ""I hope I make it to the horizon,"" because there's nothing else to compare. He can't say, ""Let's ride to the next building or mailbox"" because there are none. The endless desert features make the cyclist feel that it's just him; no one can help him; he'll die of dehydration. Then the features get worse; he sees the Welch's Grape Juice billboard, giving him little hope of survival, then he finds out that it's deserted, and that's like the final thing he gives up. The cyclist, almost unconscious, then runs into the fishing store where he has a sip of water. So, the harsh and unforgiving features of the landscape were the main reason the cyclist lost hope during his ordeal."
387	6365	3	3	The features of setting affect the author because it moves him dehydrated. The dessert sun sucked sweat out of him and he had no water to bring that would replace his electrolytes. Also, once the author had got into the hills he had lost a lot of his energy so peddling up was a lot of work. If I were the author I would also have gotten tired because you need water in your body to survive; the heat would have compounded the exhaustion, making the physical exertion even more draining.
388	6366	3	3	The features of the setting in ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî affect the cyclist greatly. In the cyclists opinion things began pretty well. He had a positive attitude as it states ìwith strong legs and a smile on my face.î As the man moves on he comes to a fort of sorts. To him, the sight was troubling. Though troubling, he still had the confidence that he could continue. Next he noticed the changes in the terrain. He explained ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î This means that he would have to peddle harder and with greater force in order to get over the hills, further depleting his energy. The weather was hot and the cyclist was running out of water. The possibility of heatstroke came to mind. ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kindî, as told by the man. His mind entered a state of sad, and hopeless thoughts, but he persevered and cycled on. At this point he was very thirsty and felt his death was near. He said ìI was going to die and the birds would pick me cleanî As he kept going he spotted an old guy in sight. He regained hope and moved ahead. The features of this story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. Physically he was tired and worn out. In this horrible state, mentally he was becoming negative and pessimistic about his travel. The setting's features interfered with the cyclist's physical and mental state, ultimately testing his resilience and highlighting the impact of environment on human endurance and mindset.
389	6367	3	3	In this story, ìNo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî, by Joe Kurmaskie I believe the setting greatly affect the cyclist. I believe this because when itís long downhill cool roads is fine, but if it is straight uphill roads and extremely hot he feels like he canít keep pedaling, especially when the sun beats down relentlessly. The cyclist gets very weary when the setting is out in the hot desert with no one around, which further impacts his morale, so the setting has a huge affect on the mood in this story. The environmental conditions, therefore, play a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience and emotional state, impacting his journey.
390	6368	3	3	A cyclist is a bike rider. They can be in groups of different people, or they can be a solo cyclist. Some cyclists go for a few miles riding their bikes; some can go for more, like @NUM1 miles. Some go over hills, go through water; they do a lot with what they do, often pushing themselves physically. They have a lot of time on their hands to ride a bike that far, developing endurance and skill.
391	6369	3	3	The setting is hot like desert, no one around, and very dry. Being hot outside affects the cyclist because he is sweaty and needs water. The relentless sun beats down, intensifying his thirst. Having no one around causes him to not get water which he needs for his journey. This isolation amplifies the danger of dehydration. These things make him weak and make it harder for him to find a place to get water, hindering his progress and jeopardizing his well-being as he desperately searches for any sign of civilization.
392	6370	3	3	The setting affect the cyclist because it could be a good or bad thing. If a cyclist adjusts his own settings, such as tire pressure or seat height, that's generally good as it optimizes performance. However, if somebody messes with them unexpectedly, that could be bad, potentially leading to discomfort or even accidents. This shows the cyclist's settings play an important role.
393	6371	3	3	"California sunshine beat down as I pedaled, Yosemite my distant goal. My journey began hopefully enough, but soon I passed through a ghost town, buildings decaying under the relentless sun, a stark reminder of dreams faded. The sight planted a seed of doubt, and I pressed on with newfound caution. Later, the tall pines emerged, their scent a promise of cool mountain air, a feeling that these were my kind of trees, that ""had my name written all over them."" This brought a surge of hope. But then a rusty pump and ramshackle shed appeared, symbols of neglect in the desolate landscape. The hope quickly faded, replaced by a renewed sense of wariness. The hills demanded grueling effort. A rattlesnake slithering across the road made me pause, and the sight of an abandoned Welch's juice company, a relic of forgotten commerce, deepened my unease. Finally, I found water at a restroom, a simple act of salvation that washed away the accumulated anxieties of the road. Without these fluctuating landscapes and stark contrasts, my ride would have been a monotonous experience, lacking the emotional peaks and valleys that made the journey a true challenge. It was the push and pull of the setting that ultimately shaped my experience, creating a narrative far more compelling than a simple bike ride."
394	6372	3	3	Winding hills, limited water, and poor directions are the troubles of this cyclist. First, he gets very bad directions from a group of old men who haven't been outside of their porch in a while, their memories of the road faded and twisted. Then, he goes through the first town and, thinking he'll find water later, doesn't fill his water bottles. Soon after, he gets lost and runs out of water, his throat parched under the blazing sun, but thankfully finds a fishing store where there is water and people who give him a better map. With renewed hydration and improved guidance, he can finally continue his journey with a sense of hope.
395	6373	3	3	"No water, and no direction effects the cyclist. Water effect cyclist because he said in the essay ìI could drop from heatstroke"" (Kurmaskie), showing the immediate danger of dehydration. Also no direction is another big one. It is important because without direction he is going to rideing for a long time, exacerbating the lack of water and increasing his risk. In conclusion water and no direction was the cyclist problem in the story."
396	6374	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he thought he packed enough water, so he began on his way. He drank most of his water less than halfway to his destination. He didn’t realize how hot it was, the sun beating down relentlessly on the shadeless road, until he got down to his last couple of sips of water. He started to become dehydrated. He remembered the old men said that the next town was about eighteen miles away, so he kept on going. When he reached the town, there was nothing to drink, just an old rundown factory baking in the heat. He took some rocks and sucked on them; he went over a bump and swallowed it. He said to himself next time he would just go by what the map said. Everything he had gone past on the way had been rundown and abandoned, reflecting the harshness of the environment. Finally, he reached a bait shop and went inside the bathroom and got some water, relieved to have finally found respite from the unforgiving landscape.
397	6375	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. For example, it was hot and hilly, causing him to get dehydrated. He went down this rusty, bumpy road, which didn't help his dehydration. And another example would be he found a place where he could sit and plan and find the best way to get where he was going. Thus, the features of the setting affected the cyclist.
398	6376	3	3	The cyclist goes through many natural settings that affect him. First of all he rides into barren land. The cyclist portrayed this barrenness by saying ìit fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.î This was in response to the first ìtownî he came across, a place clearly devoid of life and resources. Next he speaks of a large snake that came close to him which is dangerous, but luckily he manuvers out of its way, narrowly escaping a potentially deadly encounter. But the worse setting the cyclist had to deal with was the lack of water. This is a threat to any living creature, and the cyclist's thirst grew more intense with each passing mile. But in the end he found some water and the story ended fine, illustrating his resilience and the crucial role of the environment in his survival.
399	6377	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî the setting relates to how the author is feeling. At first, when the author sees the abandoned first ìtownî he is not too worried about it and moves on. ìI chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.î The author is okay, and still has enough water, so the harshness of the environment doesn't register. Next he starts to get low on water, and he becomes more panicked; which in return makes the day seem even hotter. ìI had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of california in June.î Now that the author is low on water, the day seems worse. Afterward he continues on and runs into a rattlesnake, which makes him even more panicked. ìand a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.î This close encounter amplifies his anxiety. Finally, when he got to the bait store and drank from the sink; things didnít seem so bad anymore and there was no more talk about water nor the heat. As a result the setting was related to the authorís moods. The external environment mirrored, and was influenced by, the author's internal state of mind throughout the journey.
400	6378	3	3	"The features of the setting did affect the cyclist in this small story. In this story the setting is a hot dry terrain which can be better explained by the name California. This heat of the desert climate seems to start have an effect on him about after he reaches the first town. I know this by his statement. ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at time –say, before the last war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chucked, checked my water supply and moved on. The the sun was beginning to beat down."" The summer heat is thriving how during this ride and he is drinking lots of water. So this setting does affect him greatly it causes him to use his water supply and it causes him to begin the process of dehydration. I know how the summer heat can affect you during physical activities. At times it feels like you are going to die but that building is always around the bend just for the cyclist. Therefore, the harsh Californian desert environment significantly impacts the cyclist, influencing his resource consumption and physical state."
401	6379	3	3	"In Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the features of the setting are devastating to the cyclist's condition. Traveling ""through the high desert of California"" is surely never an easy task to begin with. Without proper hydration, people often suffer heatstrokes or pass out, sometimes even perishing; it is entirely worse for this cyclist because of the effort he is exerting, pedaling over ""short, rolling hills."" Even worse, the trail a few very old, eccentric men set run on doesn't do much in the way of helping with a depleted water supply. The first town the cyclist comes across easily fits ""the traditional definition of a ghost town,"" and the only other water pump he comes to emits only sewage and incredibly hot brackish water. Therefore, the heat is only made worse by the look of water on the cyclist's path. This combination of features in the setting causes a great deal of distress to the cyclist, almost pushing him to death. The harsh, unforgiving environment, combined with the physical exertion and the false promise of relief, creates a truly life-threatening situation for the cyclist."
402	6380	3	3	There are many ways the setting affected the cyclist in this story like the weather, supply of food and water, wrong estimation for old people and the road. First off the weather was very dry and it was two hundred degrees, so it made you sweat and hard to breath. The cyclist's energy was quickly depleted under such extreme heat. The supply of water was harsh, not much around at all, and when he tried to get water the pumps would pump out not water, which left him severely dehydrated and weakened. The weather and water supply were two major affects on the cyclist, ultimately hindering his progress and threatening his well-being.
403	6381	3	3	"In the beginning of the story the author is happy, but towards the end grows upset. ""I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my faceî (@NUM1). This shows how the author is in a good mood and happy to be there. She is on a journey, and no one can touch her. Then the story takes an unexpected turn. ìWith what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,î (@NUM2). After getting lost in a town that seems distant from any living things the author hears people! She is extremely reliefed to have found anyone of help to her. She gets water and is forever greatful for the kindness shown. The setting is horrifying to her because you will feel like you cant even if you live there! She felt alone and that she would die in that place. If the setting was in a city surrounded by buildings the author would still feel some security even without water, ultimately making her experience much less frightening."
404	6382	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The reasons were the water and the hills. One reason was water because his water were cooled down after he refilled it all the way up. My last reason is because of the rolling hills, which made the ride more physically demanding. Therefore, the cyclist's experience was noticeably shaped by these environmental factors.
405	6383	3	3	There are features such as blazing heat coming off the sun, ìshort, rolling hillsî, and no water. There was also the fact that the rider thought he was in the middle of nowhere. This has a great effect on the cyclist, both physical and emotional. The relentless sun beats down, exacerbating dehydration, while the unending hills demand constant exertion. The isolation amplifies feelings of despair. The heat, lack of water and constant up hill riding can take a lot of energy out of someone and make it extremely hard to ride. Not to mention there isnít much hope left so that eliminates the whole mind over matter thing. All the features of the setting put together can lead to major trouble, creating a perilous situation for the cyclist and diminishing their chances of success.
406	6384	3	3	Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. After about @NUM1 miles, when in need of water supply the cyclist found a rusty pipe which a tarlike substance came out, then a brackish water substance. While cycling, you are in need of clean water. Next, the terrain changed from being flat to very hilly. In need of water, the last thing you need is to be challenged more physically. Later on down the road, there were no cars or any buildings in sight. When you are feeling the worst, you would want someone to be near in case you fall, but no one was in sight on that road. Lastly, seeing the old Welch's Grape Juice Factory would affect the cyclist. Seeing that image of a drink factory right in front of you but not in business has to make them feel like he/she will never make it. These specific and unfortunate features of the setting undoubtedly took a toll on the cyclist's physical and mental state, compounding the already challenging situation and potentially diminishing their resolve.
407	6385	3	3	The features in the setting dramatically affect the cyclist. Everything was fine until he ran out of water and reached the hills. Now if he was in Callala, he wouldn’t have dehydrated. But the hills were sure to play with his mind, testing his endurance with each incline. The most important setting is the Welch's grape juice factory. He would have had all of the grape juice he wanted, but it was abandoned, a silent, rusted monument to forgotten industry. An ironic twist, as he calls it, a bitter reminder of what could have been. And the last one is the bait shop that saves his life, where an old man offers him directions and a much-needed drink of water, proving that help can be found in the most unexpected places. Ultimately, the setting's harshness and unexpected kindness shaped his journey.
408	6386	3	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because he was in the middle of no-where with no water or direction. The man was also very thirsty and had no water left in his water bottle, he began to get very thirsty. I found an example to show that he was thirsty. ìThe speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruelî. By saying he was doing @NUM2 when it should have been @NUM1 was saying he was getting very exhausted and he needed water to get him feeling refreshed once again. The relentless sun and barren landscape surely amplified his thirst and fatigue, making his situation even more dire. Also, the fact that there was no one in sight to give him direction effected him too because he didnt know where the next refuge was. ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. ì From the mans point of view, he probably thought civilization was many more miles away and he probably could not make it that for. This isolation, coupled with his dehydration, would undoubtedly lead to increased anxiety. The setting effected him by making him probably begin to stress or panic a lot for the most part, as the vast emptiness and lack of resources contributed to a growing sense of desperation.
409	6387	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he feels dehydrated and tired because he is riding through the desert and has a lack of water. I often feel this way when jogging for extended periods of time. The men in the story who ""haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office"" also add to the story. Due to their role, the cyclist takes an unmarked shortcut that turns out to be horrible. The Welch’s factory affects the cyclist because it increases his thirst and causes him to once more think about it. The sign showing grape juice looks irresistible to him and drives him to keep forward in search of anything to drink. The terrain change also affects the cyclist because it causes him to have to work ever harder to get up hills now rather than just ride flat terrain. All these environmental factors combine to create a challenging and compelling journey for the cyclist, influencing his physical state and decisions along the way."
410	6388	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ìI was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.î @CAPS1 the heat the cyclist experienced, since he was in a desert in June, made him dehydrate faster. The relentless sun beat down, intensifying the need for hydration. The heat made him drink more so he ran out of water more quickly. Then he would try and conserve water by not drinking and this would cause him to dehydrate more because he was losing body fluid in sweat secondly, in paragraph @NUM2 it says, îFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,î These hills affect the cyclist because he would need to use more energy to cycle up the hills. This exertion demanded more from his muscles. This would cause him to become exhausted more quickly than he would on flat land. If the setting had been different, such as not being in a hilly desert, the cyclist would not have become as dehydrated and tired as he did. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, ultimately shaping his physical experience and challenging his endurance.
411	6389	3	3	The features of the setting directly affects the cyclist. ìI was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.î This affects the cyclist because in June it is very hot and going through a desert makes it worse, so he would continue to drink water until he has no more. The relentless sun beats down, increasing the risk of dehydration and heatstroke. He is also using energy which is making him sweat and drink more water. ìOne ramshackle shed. Several rusty pipes and a corral that couldnít hold the lamest mule greeted me.î This could also cause a problem because he canít renew his water source, which means he has to conserve it, and canít use as much energy. The desolation offers no respite from the heat, and the lack of resources compounds the physical strain. Both of these things factor into the setting, in a desert with no water, affecting the cyclist more than cycling in a cold day. Therefore, the harsh desert environment poses significant challenges, demanding careful resource management and impacting the cyclist's physical capabilities more profoundly than a more temperate setting would.
412	6390	3	3	The cyclist in, ìDo not exceed posted speed limitî, was affected greatly by the features of the setting. First of all the weather was extremely hot and hot weather just makes you feel exhausted and like you canít do anything. The sun beats down on the black asphalt, radiating heat back up and intensifying the feeling of fatigue. Also no one is in sight. She is all alone making her feel small and helpless. I know that when there is no one around I get scared. The emptiness of the road amplifies any anxieties she might already have. Finally there is no water around. The author is obviously dieing of thirst and with nothing around her she acts even thirstier. The lack of any visible respite from the sun and heat heightens the desperation for hydration. These environmental factors combine to significantly impact the cyclist's physical and mental state.
413	6391	3	3	"The setting effected the cyclist by the rough roads, the cyclist having a hard time pedaling over the roads, his tires struggling for purchase. The snake, a venomous-looking viper, scared the cyclist on his ride through the ""town,"" which was more of a desolate collection of buildings. The fact he was running out of water was compounded by the well water he found tasting like battery acid, making him even thirstier. The setting was very rough on the cyclist, turning what should have been a simple ride into a true ordeal."
414	6392	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him tired, scared, thirsty and cause him to worry. The setting was a hot California day in June and the cyclist was riding through the heat and over the hills and difficult terrain. The cyclist describes the land when he says, ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î He also says, ìOver one long, crippling hill.î As the cyclist gets further and further, he has more doubt. Fear and thirst start to get to him. He says, ìIt didnít really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.î When the cyclist finds the bait shop he has almost lost all hope, feeling the arduousness of the ride. On his way to the shop he says, ìSlowly gaining elevation while losing hope.î At the end, the setting makes the cyclist regain his strength as he sees the bait shop; when he sees it, he says, ìThen, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me.î The features of the setting put the cyclist in an unsteady ride of fear, hope and confidence, showing how powerfully the environment can impact one's physical and mental state.
415	6393	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by helping him get water for his thirst and getting back on the road to go wherever he is trying to go. But the only thing is that he didn't never say anything about getting his bait for the fish. Also, the cyclist was affected because he almost died from thirst and having no road, making the available water and path especially crucial for his survival and journey.
416	6394	3	3	He raced, trying to get to Yosemite for some rushing river.
417	6395	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Having desert roads makes you want to just lay there and not try to go any further, because you don't know where the end will be, and the heat can be draining. As for grassy, flowery land, it gives more of a sense of route, and makes you want to keep going and see many things, inspiring exploration. Hills and varied terrain make it harder to keep going but present more of a challenge, and a good workout at the same time, pushing physical limits. Ultimately, the setting undoubtedly affects the cyclist's experience and motivation.
418	6396	3	3	"When the cyclist first receives directions to Yosemite Park from the ""old timers"" he met, he was pretty confident that they knew what they were talking about. To his dismay, these elderly men sent him through life-threatening conditions in a deserted area. As the cyclist begins his journey through the hot, June weather, he ""rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face."" As he continues forward, he notices that there are no buildings, cars, or people of any kind. He passes abandoned towns and creeps into the desert flat land, a stark contrast to his initial optimism. The flatland, however, morphs into crippling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes awaiting. Not only is the terrain suddenly different, but the cyclist is rapidly deteriorating. Tiredness and lack of water make the cyclist think ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" It was amazing that through all this, the cyclist was able to reach a small fishing camp where he is quickly replenished. ""Gary and Wilber's Fish Camp"" saved the cyclist from almost certain death, teaching him to always just use his map, and to perhaps be more skeptical of folksy advice in the future."
419	6397	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit.î The features of the area the cyclist rides through affect him greatly. For example when the narration says, ìAt some point, humble weeds crossed my pathî (Kurmaskie @NUM1), the cyclist's spirit seems low, perhaps symbolizing obstacles. The tone of the cyclist from the quote above shows despair creeping into his mind. Also, another good example is when the narration says, ì@CAPS1 hill, a building came into viewî (Kurmaskie @NUM1), suggesting progress and the possibility of reaching a destination. The cyclist sounds more hopeful than before. That is how the area the cyclist enters affects him, influencing his emotions and outlook during the journey.
420	6398	3	3	"The cyclist is affected by many features of the desert. The main feature is the heat. ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" He’s also running low on water, ""The water bottles only contained a few tantalizing sips."" He’s faced by extreme heat and lack of water. He wipes the sweat from his brow, feeling the grit of the desert on his skin. He’s tired and has a long way to go, the sun beating down relentlessly. So far, all of the towns have been deserted, amplifying his sense of isolation. Finally, he reaches a bait shop and thankfully refills his water and promised himself to stick to the map in the future, learning a valuable lesson about the desert's harsh realities."
421	6399	3	3	In the essay the setting affects the cyclist in different ways. For example, the course must have been tough because he was dehydrated, suggesting high temperatures and lack of water sources, and it says that there are rolling hills and rough roads, contributing to physical exhaustion. Another example is there were dangerous animals like snakes that he came across, posing a direct threat to his safety and adding a layer of psychological stress. In conclusion, these are some reasons how the setting affects the cyclist.
422	6400	3	3	The terrain described in this essay add affect to the strugles of the cyclist. For example when the author says ìtheir were no cars nor buildings in sightî that adds to the affect that he is really out in the middle of nowhere, emphasizing his isolation and vulnerability as he battles the elements. Also it adds a lot of affect when he comes upon an abandond juice factory and he is so thirsty he puts stones in his mouth to gather saliva, illustrating the desperation and physical hardship he is enduring. Also when he finally finds water an ìoldtimerî asks if he knows the best way to go, highlighting the cyclist's dependence on others and the uncertainty of his journey. Ultimately, the harsh environment amplifies the cyclist's ordeal and underscores the magnitude of his achievement.
423	6401	3	3	The cyclist is riding in the desert. It is extremely hot out because it’s June and that causes a lot of problems for him. He said that since it was so hot he was afraid of getting dehydrated, a serious concern given the arid conditions. Also, he explains that the roads were getting hilly, which would have caused him to work harder, meaning he was losing more water through sweat and respiration, compounding his fear of dehydration and making the journey increasingly difficult.
424	6402	3	3	The features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, he could tell there’d be some issue. It was a deserted, run down area with boarded up shops and peeling paint. The water fountain, the only source of refreshment, sputtered lukewarm water. Down the road the setting started to change from flat land to hills, the smooth asphalt giving way to rough, uneven terrain. There was a big snake in the road, sunning itself on the warm asphalt, forcing him to swerve precariously. He was becoming very dehydrated going through hilly areas with little to no water, the relentless sun beating down and sapping his strength. The unforgiving environment thus presented a series of escalating challenges, hindering his progress and threatening his well-being.
425	6403	3	3	I think it explains because they did a good job, demonstrating competence and achieving some success. But it was not entirely good either, suggesting that some aspects were lacking or flawed. Because they did the right thing, indicating ethical or correct actions were taken, but they did the same thing wrong too, revealing inconsistencies or errors in their approach, it leads to a mixed assessment of their overall performance. Consequently, a balanced perspective is necessary to fully understand the nuances of their actions and their ultimate impact.
426	6404	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead : Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Dehydration caused by heat and not enough water caused the cyclist to sweat profusely and to feel nauseous. The unforgiving sun beating down intensified these effects. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke, caused me to laugh.” In this quote, he is thinking about all the bad and horrible things that could happen to him because he is already in a bad state, made worse by the environment. In conclusion, this is how the features of the setting affects the cyclist, pushing him to his physical and mental limits.
427	6405	3	3	The features affect the cyclist in a big way. For one the heat beating down on him made him sweaty, hot and tired. The relentless heat had also made him thirst which led him to drink a lot of water in a little amount of time so he ran out of water before the next town. Also the fact he was in the desert meant there were no trees to give him any shade where he could rest. There were also no people around to help him or give him water. So, facing all these challenges, in the ride he struggled more than he thought he could.
428	6406	3	3	Some of the things that affect the cyclist was the lack of water. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips; water is of big importance to sport men. Your body needs water to work right. The humid, dry weather of California was a factor, too. The high deserts of California in June could drop someone from a heatstroke. The sun is unbearable, especially without shade and water, affecting the cyclist. The absence of animals also had an impact. There was no one in sight. It would have been a lot easier for the cyclist if a store or people would have been around; the same exact thing is true of the animals. A large snake crossed my path. A diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement. It would have been too much to worry about those things; these are all things that affect the cyclist, highlighting the challenges faced during the ride.
429	6407	3	3	Rolling hills, open terrain, and high deserts are all features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, rolling hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end, especially during inclines that demand bursts of power. The open terrain leads to the beating sun, which also puts pressure on the cyclist, potentially causing dehydration and overheating. Lastly, high deserts would affect the cyclist because he has to pedal for miles on end in rough, dry terrain, putting strain on him overall and making hydration even more critical. Therefore, these environmental factors create a challenging landscape for the cyclist.
430	6408	3	3	In the case of the cyclist in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting has an enormous effect on the biker. Predominantly, the weather causes him to feel dehydrated. He says that he “had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly.” He tries to get water from the old well, demonstrating just how much he needed water. The water in this pump, the owner said, was, “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” If the water has reached such a high temperature, the reader infers that it must be hot outside; the author implied this when he says it is California in June, it is a clear day, and the sun was beating down. Another aspect of the setting, the lane, dirty, “ghost town” infested land, had a large effect on the cyclist. As he begins to lose hope, he cannot see any signs of modern life; “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This empty land makes the cyclist himself feel empty. Most literally, the fact that the setting was unknown to the cyclist affected his confusion. He didn’t know the best path to his destination and therefore relied on others for aid, further emphasizing the impact of his unfamiliar surroundings. Because of this reliance, he ends up lost and alone, thus solidifying the setting's influence on his physical and mental state.
431	6409	3	3	There were many different conditions that effected the cyclist. He did not have the proper ammount of water for the journey witch made it difficult. He states in the story, ìThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.î The terrain and hills made it difficult, testing his physical endurance. He ran into snakes and very deserted country, increasing the sense of isolation. But his determination led to success and arrived into a town, signaling the end of his challenging ride and the triumph of perseverance.
432	6410	3	3	"In the short story ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When he arrives in the first ìtownî that the old men told him to go to, the cyclist ìchuckled and moved onî, and acted just sort of indifferent, to seeing this old town. As he reached ìthe fork of sortsî twenty miles up the road, ""the sight was troubling to him his water supply was somewhat deteriorating, so he became a bit unnerved. Finally when the cyclist read the sign that said ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî, the author continued to move on, but with a large chunk of his confidence gone. He was dehydrated, tired, and had lost a lot of hope after coming across all these places. When he saw the sign for Gary and Wilberís fish camp, he was as happy as could be, knowing he would drink some water continue his journey the next day, and not listen to old menís directions again. Many people in stories or in real life are affected by the setting they are in. In the novel Breakfast of Champions by Vonnegut, one of the characters named Kilgore Trout went on a journey to find an art exhibition, running into many problem's on the way, which in many cases, gave him a lack of hope in reaching his destination safely. Ultimately, both the cyclist and Kilgore Trout demonstrate how external environments can significantly impact internal states, shaping their experiences and influencing their resolve."
433	6411	3	3	Some features can affect the cyclist. The weather can slow them down like if it was cold or hot outside; extreme temperatures can negatively impact performance. If the person does not get enough sleep, this too can affect their performance. Therefore, multiple factors can influence a cyclist's overall ability and speed.
434	6412	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the road that he was on. He was on a road that had snakes and that the trees where all on the road. The road was like a snake cause it was waved and it had a hug hill that made you go fast and it was hard to star dark because the hill was stipped and know one would ride that hill by if it was a rash than it would have been easier to ride the hill cause than there will be more people these would be some people that are these that can help you if you get hurt. There is also no lights there or if you ride at night then you canít see where you are going un less you put a light on you bike or himilet then you can ride easier the hill at night. Also, the lack of other riders means less potential assistance should an accident occur. That light there is the features of the setting that affects the cyclist that is going down a hill that know one is there that can help you if you need the help you can get it. Thus, the cyclist's experience is significantly shaped by the road's challenging and isolated environment.
435	6413	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there was a lot of detours and distractions where the cyclist rode. These included unexpected road work and the curious onlookers they attracted. The cyclist had to pay full attention to the road or else the cyclist could have been seriously injured. The features of the setting also affect the cyclist because he has to go down steep hills and windy turns, demanding skillful maneuvering and precise braking. In conclusion the features of the setting has a huge affect on the cyclist.
436	6414	3	3	Setting can affect a cyclist in many ways. Just as I read in the story, being in a desert dehydrated him. It was hot, the road was bumpy and the dangers of poisonous snakes. The cyclist could have died in many ways such as: heatstroke, falling off his bike, dehydration, and a bite from a snake. Say, in the mountains of Nepal, there are many problems that face you there. Avalanches could bury you alive, the air is thin, making it hard to breathe, and the steep, winding paths could lead to a fatal fall. Therefore, the environment plays a crucial role in a cyclist's safety and well-being.
437	6415	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist by causing him to be hit with his water bottle regularly, the high deserts of California affected him. Not the miles into the next section of the ride, he noticed a terrain change. For example flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills, challenging his rhythm. Then after overcoming that change in terrain, a large highway sign jumped out at him saying or reading, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit.” And that was 55, presenting a new physical challenge. Last the author says, “Sometimes life can feel so cruel,"" as the cyclist faced yet another obstacle in his journey. In conclusion there were many things that affected the cyclist, from the jarring water bottle to the rough road, making his ride a true test of endurance."
438	6416	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way is that they would drink up all of their water because it was hot and they would get extremely thirsty from all of that exertion.
439	6417	3	3	In the essay titled “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed the Speed Limit,” the setting changes, and so does the mood of the essay as well as the mood of the cyclist. For example, towards the beginning of the essay, at the reservoir, the essay states, “At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening.” This shows how, towards the beginning of the essay, the cyclist is happy, just woke up, and is getting ready to go on a nice bike ride; however, this all changes when he gets directions from a couple of “old-timers.” From that point on, his trip goes downhill, and the essay states, “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town,’ a ghost town.” “The sun was beginning to beat down.” This also shows that the setting of a ghost town and a setting with the sun beating down is affecting the mood of the essay and the mood of the cyclist, as well as when he goes another twenty miles to a different ghost town with only a few rusty water pumps containing acid-flavored water. At this point, the cyclist is very worried because it's hot and he has no water, while knowing he has another thirty miles to go. Thirty miles of rolling hills and hot sun, while seeing a “Rough Road Ahead” sign and a diamondback snake, he is sure he is going to die. However, it all changes when he sees a different sign, one for a bait shop. This clearly demonstrates how the author, Joe Kurmaskie, effectively utilizes the setting to influence and shape the overall mood and emotional tone of his narrative.
440	6418	3	3	The dusty, dry setting has a serious effect on the cycling author. It got so long and hot that, “Ö@CAPS1 blues tune 'summer time' rattled around in my deteriorating brain.” The relentless heat, combined with the parched landscape, was clearly taking its toll, his thoughts becoming fragmented and repetitive. He has spent so long cycling through heat, his brains starting to shut down, a consequence of the grueling conditions. It's also because there is very little water left for him, exacerbating the physical and mental strain. Another problem is that every building/town except the last building is deserted, offering no respite or assistance. So without any chance of being refueled and restocked, it's the author v.s nature, a stark battle against the elements. Plus, as the author states, the directions came from old people who, “haven't left their porches since Carter was in office.” The world has greatly changed since then. Towns have become deserted, buildings rundown but the roads are kept in shape, a strange juxtaposition of decay and maintenance. The towns the old people mentions are now ghost towns, and are no help to the author, rendering their outdated guidance useless and highlighting the author's increasing isolation and vulnerability.
441	6419	3	3	As the cyclist continues on his ride, changes begin to occur in the surroundings, which ultimately affects the cyclist’s attitude. When first starting out on his journey to Yosemite, the cyclist started out that morning, “with strong legs and a smile on my face.” He had received information from a few of the older locals that would help to cut the amount of time it took to arrive at Yosemite National Park. However, as he was riding, the cyclist realized that perhaps the older men’s travel advice was a little out dated, the once-smooth asphalt giving way to cracked and uneven surfaces. With barely any water left to hydrate himself, and being surrounded by nothing but more road and desert, the cyclist couldn’t help but laugh. “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” At this point, the cyclist was mad at himself for not just using the map that he had brought with him instead of listening to the locals. Although the cyclist remained determined to find water, he had begun to lose hope when he suddenly came across a bait store, a small oasis in the arid landscape. Here he was able to rehydrate himself with a cold bottle of water, and with his renewed spirit, continued on his journey, this time using his map and feeling more confident about reaching his destination.
442	6420	3	3	The cyclist was riding on a rough, bumpy, dangerous road. He had to be on the look out for animals that might try and hurt or even kill him. Since he had no water he was dehydrating. Also, the road was hot and not very well taken care of; it took more energy to get through it. The sun beat down mercilessly, adding to his exhaustion as the uneven surface jarred his bones with each rotation of the pedals. His throat felt like sandpaper, and his vision started to blur. He knew he needed to find shade and water soon, or his ride could end tragically.
443	6421	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it just looks like he is on the highway, as in the desert riding his motorcycle or bike, and it does look like he's coming or going on a vacation. Because of the way he's riding, it seems he's going real fast, almost as if he is about to fall or lose control. This sense of speed and potential instability is amplified by the vast, open space of the desert highway, making his journey seem both exhilarating and precarious.
444	6422	3	3	The cyclist is out in the desert, and therefore was tired and also running out of water, so he's getting dehydrated. The relentless sun beat down, exacerbating his thirst and fatigue as the water bottle grew lighter with each passing mile, heightening the risk of dehydration in the arid landscape.
445	6423	3	3	"The setting of the story affected the cyclist by changing his mood. At the start, he had confidence, which died once he got into the barren desert but picked up when he found a rest stop. A prime example is how he started ""with leads and a smile on my face,"" to ""the growing realization that I could [be] dropping heartstroke on a gorgeous day in June because I [didn't] listen to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their perch in decades."" This quickly turned into ""I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait."" The overall mood of the story is based on how the author feels, showing how surroundings can significantly impact one's emotional state and motivation."
446	6424	3	3	The features of the setting in this story, “Do not exceed Posted Speed limit,” affect the cyclist in a huge way. The cyclist was biking through California in a desert-like area. It can get very hot there, like the writer describes, “wide rings of sweat circled my shirt.” The fact that the area he was biking through was a desert and that he ran out of water put himself into serious danger. Also, since the cyclist had no water he was becoming dehydrated, as evidenced by his dry mouth and increasing fatigue. The area he was biking through had barely any people or signs of civilization. This means there was no water available for him to replenish his supply. Therefore, if the setting had taken place in a cooler setting with lots of people, the cyclist would have likely found water. Without this type of setting, the story would have completely changed. The harsh environment is central to the cyclist’s struggle and the building tension of the narrative.
447	6425	3	3	The setting very much affects the cyclist. ìI maneuvered down the hill.î This statement shows him going down the hill. If the hill wasnt there then it would have been a whole lot easier for him to get to where he was going, also he would have had more energy. If there werent any hills to get in his way, the cyclist's journey would be less taxing. The presence of the hill dictates the cyclist's actions and effort. Therefore, the environment significantly impacts the cyclist's experience and exertion.
448	6426	3	3	"The setting in this story was hot and filled with rolling hills. These factors greatly effected the cyclist. The hot weather was bad for the cyclist because he had a limited water supply. The text says, ìThe sun was beginning to beat downî (@NUM1). Showing the temperature was rising, which exacerbated his dehydration. The text says, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (@NUM2). The authorís battery was leaking acid so it was harder to make it over the hills. The leaking acid also made it more difficult for him to see the path ahead. Seems like everything went wrong for this man but he still made it, demonstrating his resilience and determination despite the challenging conditions."
449	6427	3	3	"In the start story ìDo not exceed speed limit,î time of year and place setting were the main things that affected the cyclist. This story takes place in the deserts of california in June. The fact that the story took place in June (and especially in a California desert) really is what caused the cyclistís dehydration. June in the desert brings intense sunlight and scorching temperatures. Anywhere in this country, June is summer, and summer means that it gets hotter and more humid than usual. This heat cause the dehydration and the ""growing realization that I (the author) experienced heat exhaustion. Therefore, the time of year and location are crucial elements contributing to the cyclist's predicament."
450	6428	3	3	The settings in the story affected the cyclist throughout the story; with winding roads and hills, pedaling can already be tough, tiring, and challenging. The rider, having little knowledge of the way or the roads, found it ten times harder to deal with the uncertainty. And with no landmarks or places in sight, it's hard to maintain confidence because there is nothing concrete to strive for, thus impacting the cyclist's mental and physical state as they continue on this arduous journey.
451	6429	3	3	Don’t let anything stop you with your goals. Going to Yosemite National Park takes a status that would put home offside. Forty miles into the trials comes a town. Got to a water station and get nothing because old men say “the water taste like buttery acid.” Lead going to hills and asylum towns. @CAPS1 can be rode without anything to drink. People die from heat attacks because they don’t sit and take hearts for water and food. The unforgiving landscape and scarce resources highlight the importance of preparation and resilience when pursuing ambitious goals.
452	6430	3	3	Features in the setting of the cyclist do in fact affect him in many ways. The setting in the passage include features like, no one to be seen, no buildings, dirty, bumpsy terrain, hot weather and plenty of vegetation. All these features affect the cyclist in negative ways. For instance, the dry weather affects the human body with dehydration which the cyclist is affected by, hindering his performance. The uneven terrain also presents a challenge, making it harder to maintain balance and speed. The isolation of the location, with no one to be seen or buildings nearby, could lead to feelings of loneliness and vulnerability. Therefore, the environmental factors collectively pose difficulties for the cyclist.
453	6431	3	3	The setting in the story affect the cyclist alot. It is June in the California desert. The sun is beating down on him relentlessly, with temperatures soaring well above 100 degrees. Another problem that he faces is that there is a very rough terrain, full of jagged rocks and loose gravel. All of this together makes him drink up his water even faster, depleting his supply at an alarming rate. The setting is making him feel very desperate, and this desperation only worsens his situation, compounding the physical challenges with a growing mental strain.
454	6432	3	3	Each person has a really good ability that stands out. Someone can be good looking, smart or confident. Someone @MONTH1 never give up and do what he wishes to do. The cyclist in the story is or man with a strong will. He wants to be alive. He saw too many difficulties in his way to get the place he wanted to be. He listened to some old guys and he lost his way. The sun was beginning to beat down. He was out of water but he continued riding to reach his goal. He was losing his strength. The weather was @NUM1 degrees @CAPS1. The water tasted like acid battery. He believed himself that he can be alive. He got stronger by believing in himself eventhough he was losing strength. Every place that he passed by was a new experience for life. They were like a game that he came successful. He never gave up. He did everything he could do to not losing his mind. He didn't want to lose the battle in his mind. Ultimately, his unwavering determination and self-belief allowed him to overcome the challenges and continue his journey.
455	6433	3	3	The features of the setting made the cyclist more tired and thirsty. The rolling hills where he had to pedal up and down and the desert with no water in sight, just dry land, really took a toll. Everything in the setting was increasing the conflict in his story. The old Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, is like drinks are right there but are now gone. If it would have been Yosemite with cool pines and rivers he would’ve felt completely different. No people in sight lacked security and water, also no buildings offered refuge. The tumble weeds gave you no hope of getting any where and the snakes and vultures just eating you after you died, seemed like a real possibility. Everything in the story was the opposite of what he wanted until he got to his last hope the bait shop, a place that surprisingly offered respite and a chance to quench his thirst.
456	6434	3	3	In the story ìRough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî the setting of the story majorly affected the cyclist. The story tells us ìÖI was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.î The extreme heat of the summer definitely put a strain on the cyclist causing him to have to drink lots of water . Unfortonatly the ìtownsî were very far apart and many not having good water making dehydration a problem. ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.î None of this would have happened had he been cycling at a marathon with people handing him water when requested, or if he had been smart enough to follow a good map. The isolation of the desert, coupled with the scarcity of resources, amplified the challenges he faced, making the journey far more perilous than it needed to be; therefore, the environmental factors played a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience.
457	6435	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example, on page @NUM1, Kurmaskie said ì I got down on my hands working the hande of the rusted water pump with all my strengthî that shows desperation due to the lack of water. This harsh, arid environment clearly impacted him, forcing him to exert considerable effort for a basic necessity. This struggle highlights how the unforgiving landscape directly influenced his physical and mental state.
458	6436	3	3	The features of the setting have been a major affect of this cyclist in the story. On the normal road, the ground is smooth but this stretch is a lot like a winding maze. The cyclist also comes across bumps and non-paved roads that make it hard to maneuver through. Then you add the fact that there are not really any towns and he is in blazing heat with little water, making the journey even more arduous. The setting of this passage played a key role in the story, directly impacting the cyclist's struggle and overall experience.
459	6437	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in the high deserts of California where it is very hot so, you need alot of water. Then he needs more water and finds a water pump but cant use the water because it was ìsome where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" Then the terrain changes when he says ìFlat road was replaced by hills, then mountains."" This change in terrain further complicates the journey, requiring even more physical exertion and emphasizing the demanding nature of the environment, ultimately affecting the cyclist's progress and well-being."
460	6438	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because I was talking about exceeding the posted speed limit. How the speed limit is determined and where it's posted matters. Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office. What they are trying to say is that if you follow their advice, your travel will not work; so make the right choice and do the right thing, ultimately leading to a more successful and informed journey.
461	6439	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by that he or she should behave, act, or talk according to the settings. It means that wherever they are existing and whatever it looks like, they need to fit themselves in. They also need to fit the mood according to where they are located. The cyclist is feeling comfortable according to the story and he doesn't need any change in setting or location, implying a sense of contentment with the surroundings. For conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by that he needs to make improvement and changes according to where he or she is located, suggesting adaptability is key.
462	6440	3	3	In the beginning the cyclist was ready to go and happy. By the time he got half way there he was losing hope. It was very hot and he was simply alone on the long stretch of road. By the end, he was relieved because not only did he find water, he found an easier way to get to Yosemite. The first old group of men didn't help when he asked for directions, but the second man did, pointing him toward a less strenuous path. Ultimately, he was grateful for the unexpected assistance.
463	6441	3	3	"In the story ìDo not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the features of the setting affect the cyclist, it says this because the cyclist enables us of what is going around him and he feels about it. It says, ìone ramshack shed, several rusty pumps and a coral that couldnít hold the lamest mule greated me. The author goes on to say that it troubled him. Actually that made the author scared that maybe he was all alone in the desert with ghost town. The unplanned roads were rusty where the speed limit was 55 mph since he barely had any water he was going 12 mph. This tells me, heís troubled and confused about the surrounding ways, because it all desert seem light it became the author is slowly loosing hope on the travels further and further. I think itís the same week people that as soon as trouble comes; or looks like itís among they start losing hope and their better judgment, and life seems a lot harder. The desolate landscape with its dilapidated structures clearly weighs on the cyclist's mind, creating a sense of isolation and unease. The unexpected condition of the roads, in stark contrast to the posted speed limit, further contributes to his growing despair. Ultimately, the harsh and unwelcoming environment mirrors the internal struggle, causing him to lose hope and making his journey even more difficult."
464	6442	3	3	In this story it seems as if everything is dry. The rider would be getting real thirsty under the scorching sun. He is all by himself; that would make any man feel strong, because if you had an accident nobody would be there to help. He's going up and down steep hills so he would have to be careful of loose gravel. The lone rider's safety hinges on cautious navigation of the arid landscape.
465	6443	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For instance, if you were cycling in a very cold climate you wouldn’t sweat as much and wouldn’t need to drink as much water, but in the story the cyclist is in a very hot climate and he runs out of water, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide rings of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June…” This quote explains that the setting of the cycling plays a huge role in the cyclist. Also, the terrain can affect a biker. If one was to ride on a flat terrain, it isn't gonna put much wear and tear on the cyclist's body; therefore, the flat terrain would be easier. In contrast, hilly or mountainous terrain demands more exertion, impacting the cyclist's energy levels and requiring more physical strength. All of those reasons explain that the settings affect the cyclist in many ways.
466	6444	3	3	The setting plays an important part in the author's mood. When the author finds the dilapidated ghost town, he is still high spirited and amused. He thinks that it is a little funny that the old men’s ìtownî was now abandoned. ìÖ(the town) fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckledÖî This shows that the author is still in good spirits because he can still laugh. The sun beat down, but the author felt a sense of adventure. When ìa tar like substance oozed out of the water pump at the next stop the author became a little unsettled, as the author was running low on water. But he was still optimistic, hoping the next pump would be better. Once the rolling expansive hills came into view, the author let out a ìsad, hopeless laugh.î The author was depressed, dehydrated and had all but given up, however he kept going and eventually made it to some water. The harshness of the landscape mirrored his dwindling hope, but his perseverance ultimately led him to relief.
467	6445	3	3	"In the passage ìRough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Speed Limitî the setting definitely affects the cyclist. When the cyclist comes to the first abandoned ìtownî he searches for water but finds only that which tastes like battery acid ìwhen I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.î This makes his dehydration seem much worse because of the fact that he has water, it is just undrinkable, a cruel irony. The rough road ahead there gives the feeling of determination because when the cyclist is on his last legs he must work even harder to get water ""a flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,î this quote shows that despite his condition the cyclist must persevere. Also, the quote ìtumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake ñìtumbleweeds and snakes give the feeling of desolation and of being alone, which is what the cyclist is this point. The setting of this story directly correlates with how the cyclist is feeling, mirroring his internal struggle through the external environment. Ultimately, the harsh and unforgiving landscape amplifies the cyclist's physical and emotional challenges, emphasizing the profound impact of the setting on his journey."
468	6446	3	3	The hot day in June riding a bike in the desert. The cyclist rode off into the sun on his way to Yosemite National Park. The old men told him where to go on the map even though they had not been through that way in years. When the cyclist started his day off ready to go. He thought he would be able to stop and get water regularly but as he found out he was in the middle of the desert with no water around. The man pushed himself and stopped thinking about water. He even put pebbles in his mouth to suck on so he would be able to keep his mind off water. The man was very smart in this situation and knew what to do. This experience has made him stronger, showing his resilience in the face of unexpected adversity.
469	6447	3	3	FLAT ROADS, HILLS, BUILDING - ALL ARE SETTINGS THAT AFFECTED THE CYCLIST. While the roads were flat the cyclist was determined he could make it and wasn’t going to give up on himself. When the hills got bigger and harder to pedal, he began to get exhausted and tired from the climb. Lastly, the buildings were what made him want to give up on his journey. When he sees the building of the Welch’s Grape Juice Factory and the young boy drinking, he “hung his head.” He was getting more tired as he went along his route. The landscape was making him feel as if he didn’t want to keep moving along, showing how the environment played a significant role in his declining morale.
470	6448	3	3	"The setting affected the cyclist greatly. He had no water and he was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The deserts and no water could have been life-or-death to him, making him stressed and thirsty. Couple that with him biking, and you have yourself a dehydrated man in the desert! When he was between the ghost town and bait shop he says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,"" This would make the cyclist think that there is no hope for his survival if he passed out, due to the remoteness. The oppressive heat beating down would only worsen his condition. The deserts of California affects any cyclist greatly especially one without water like the cyclist in the story, as it presents a harsh and unforgiving environment."
471	6449	3	3	It think it means to be all you can be. This implies maximizing your potential and striving for self-improvement.
472	6450	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of how hot it is, how big the hill is and the shortage of cold water. For example it is so hot that the cyclist does not think he is going to make it. Also all he could do was a water depleting @NUM1 push on the pedals. Also the hills became so big he crested the first couple until the sign jumped out saying rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly he had some rough terrain to ride over and no water; he was at a dehydrated state and he could only do a water depleting @NUM1 push on the pedals when the speed limit was @NUM3 miles per hour. Ultimately, these environmental factors significantly hampered the cyclist's progress and well-being.
473	6451	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by causing him to become dehydrated and start to lose consciousness. For example, the town he was supposed to come to was just an abandoned factory, and he had to travel another @NUM1 miles or so with no water under the scorching sun. This unexpected extension of his journey, coupled with the oppressive heat and lack of resources, severely impacted his physical state. Ultimately, the harsh environment and the misleading information about his destination took a significant toll.
474	6452	3	3	The humid climate and hot weather will want to make you keep over if you don't have water in your possession. Like near the end of the essay the person sucked on stones to try retain water better which I never heard about it its time. This weather is the cause of the character's dehydration, which is a symptom of lack of water in the body, ultimately highlighting the harsh environmental conditions and their impact on survival.
475	6453	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because in paragraph @NUM1 it says that the temperature was getting high and that when he drank the water, it tasted like battery acid. This would affect him because if it was so hot, and the water was starting to get hot, how would he be able to get through the day without passing out? The intense heat and the undrinkable water would certainly lead to dehydration and exhaustion. Also, in paragraph @NUM2 it says the roads changed to hills; when you ride up and down hills, you become tired from pumping your legs, then you would feel hot and tired and would not want to ride the bike. Navigating the hilly terrain would significantly drain his energy and motivation, making the ride physically and mentally taxing. Thus, the harsh temperature and difficult terrain pose significant challenges that impact the cyclist's ability to complete his journey.
476	6454	3	3	The cyclist is affected by the fatiguing setting in the story. The hills affected him because they were harder to get over.
477	6455	3	3	"The features of the setting, or environment, in which the cyclist is in greatly affects him. First of all, after leaving the campground with directions from the older gentlemen, he enters an area that is greatly isolated. In paragraph @NUM1, he wrote, ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time but on @TIME1, it fit the traditonal definition of a ghost town."" This state of being alone later affected the cyclist because his increasing dehydration was becoming dangerous; if he were to collapse, he would most likely die, with no one to help him. This drove the cyclist to continue on in order to survive. Another aspect that affected him was the extremely hot temperature. In paragraph, he implies the weather is hot by telling the reader he is traveling through to California desert in June, a time known for intense heat. The heat gives the cyclist another obstacle to overcome in his struggling to get to the next town for water, pushing him to his physical limits. Lastly in paragraph @NUM2, he mention the terrain changes to gently rolling hills. This shows the physical and metaphorical obstacles must get over the heat and isolation, but must also find the mental drive and determination to carry on, demonstrating how the environment shapes his actions and resolve."
478	6456	3	3	The setting affect the cyclist in a lot of ways; one way is that if you don't know where you're going, you could get hurt by getting lost in a dangerous area. Also, if the road conditions are very bad with potholes or debris, accidents could occur. That is how the setting affected the cyclist, influencing both safety and navigation.
479	6457	3	3	In this essay, features of the setting affect the cyclist in his journey to get to Yosemite, making it worse. First, for example, the cyclist was in the high deserts of California in the heat of June. This makes it bad because the intense heat makes the already challenging physical exertion even harder on the cyclist. Also, being in the deserts, there wasn't any water supply, so after the cyclist ran out of water it got worse because he got dehydrated, and this caused him to become weaker and not pedal as fast. Furthermore, the author says that the terrain changes from flat roads to short rolling hills, which also made it more difficult because the short hills required bursts of extra work, and since it was so hot and he didn't have water, he couldn't function as well as if he was hydrated. Therefore, the harsh environment of the desert, combined with the lack of water and the varied terrain, significantly compounded the cyclist's difficulties in reaching Yosemite.
480	6458	3	3	The features in the setting of this story affect the cyclist very much so. Throughout this story this poor person has to get lost and end up in the middle of nowhere. By her being out there, her cycle was being affected, picking up dirt and who knows what else. She was just trying to get somewhere and get things done, but of course didn’t. She kept moving on down the road, determined to find her way. This story was very good and showed that she cared and wanted it bad, persevering despite the challenges the unexpected location presented.
481	6459	3	3	In this story, the cyclist had to ride through the desert, during June and with little water. I would say that this has a big effect on the cyclist since he dehydrates a lot and is threatened with heatstroke. Also, he had to ride carefully past a huge snake which could have hurt him. Personally, I don’t know what he was doing riding through the desert by himself, and that’s his problem. But clearly, the harsh conditions and lack of preparation made this a dangerous and difficult journey for the cyclist.
482	6460	3	3	"In ""Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit"" the setting in many ways affects the cyclist. Three of those things are heat, lack of water, and the unexpected emptiness of the town. The heat affects him because he gets extremely hot and tired. For example the text states, ""I could die from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June,"" this shows that it was extremely hot. The cyclist had a lack of water and was very thirsty. For example it states in the text, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This shows that he was very thirsty from lack of water. The last way the setting affects the cyclist is when he goes into a town and finds it empty. The text states, ""on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" This shows that he expected it to be there so he could rest, but it wasn't like it was supposed to be. These things all show how the setting negatively impacted the cyclist's journey and well-being."
483	6461	3	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in a couple of ways. The first and main way was that he was riding through the desert. This caused him to sweat badly and get very dehydrated because of the intense heat and lack of shade. The seconded way was that there were rough roads and hilly spots; this made him more tired faster, straining his muscles and slowing his pace. In conclusion the setting did not help him not one little bit.
484	6462	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist should have looked at his map instead of taking the old man's advice because all the information was on the map, including the dangerous terrain. He almost died because he listened to the old man and didn't look at his map, trusting bad information. If the cyclist was in a car, maybe he would have had better luck because he would be going faster than the @NUM1 bike and be able to navigate the rough terrain more easily. Ultimately, relying on the map would have been safer than trusting the old man’s possibly outdated or inaccurate directions.
485	6463	3	3	"Many things on the cyclist's journey affected him. It was in the middle of summer in California. The heat is unbelievable and ridiculously hot. ""I could drop from heatstroke,"" he thought, as he was so badly overheated and dehydrated that he could have died any minute. He could have also been killed by a giant snake. ""Look like a diamondback,"" he thought, ""blocked the majority of the pavement."" It could have easily killed him if he wasn't careful. But with his determination and spite, he pulled through and made it to a fresh supply of water. If he would have given up, his life would have been over, but his resilience proved stronger than the challenges he faced."
486	6464	3	3	When the cyclist went to ask about the road the old men told him all its good way that he should go. But the old man hasn't seen the land in a really long time. The man doesn't know that the land has changed. So when the cyclist went back to ride the roads and everything ends up being different than described, the cyclist didn't know what to do. He found himself lost and facing unexpected obstacles because the old men's information was so outdated.
487	6465	3	3	There are many reasons how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. There are ways mentally and physically. The ways mentally is that the cyclists can lose determination and pride if they cannot fight the journey of cycling, especially if the terrain is unexpectedly challenging or visually monotonous, leading to discouragement. The ways physically is the setting is hot and rough and the cyclist would have lack of water and food supplies, causing dehydration and exhaustion, ultimately impacting their performance and well-being. Those were the ways how cyclist would be affected by the features of the setting both mentally and physically.
488	6466	3	3	The cyclist in îRough road Aheadî was riding his bike in the middle of June, and in California. Both are very bad if you are lost and on a bike. This is because in June it usually hot, and I know in @CAPS1 California itís usually always hot, The cyclist is on a bike this means he has to pedde everywhere he goes. This is not along going to use up all his energy but also make him hot, And when your this hot you need to keep hydrated. But your lost so if you use all your water before you find safty then your in major trouble. Also In California theres like Hills, and mountains and stoff and peddling up a mountain isnít an easy trick, and can be incredibly draining, compounding the difficulties of being lost and dehydrated. This combination of factors paints a grim picture for a cyclist lost in California in June, highlighting the serious challenges they face.
489	6467	3	3	"The features of the cyclist affect him in many ways. One way that the features affected him was that when he ran out of water all the buildings were like a ghost town. He said that there was no one in sight. In the story it says ""the building abandoned years earlier."" If I was him I would have turned around and went back so I wouldn't take the chance of dying out in the middle of an abandoned area, as the desolation clearly pointed towards a lack of resources or help. Therefore, returning would increase his odds of survival."
490	6468	3	3	The setting is the main factor on effects on the cyclist. The cyclist’s main problem is that he is low on water & dehydrated, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” The author wouldn’t have been so dehydrated if it weren’t so hot. Also, all the problems he faces are setting related like the snake & the rough road, both dangers exacerbated by the harsh environment. If it would have taken place in a more mild area, there wouldn’t have been any conflicts, and the cyclist's journey would have been considerably easier. Thus, the challenges are intrinsically linked to the environment.
491	6469	3	3	In the story the cyclist is afected by setting because in the @NUM1 paragraph it talks about him seeing the old water pump and how he was trying to get water out. At the end of the story he gets angry when he sees the old welches juice factory because he relizes that the old men didnít know what they were talking about. Also at the end he is realived when he finds Gary and @ORGANIZATION1 because there is water there, ultimately showing how the availability, or lack thereof, of water in these locations shaped his emotional state and the outcome of his journey.
492	6470	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie in a very profound way. While he is riding, he sees surrounding him ""no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" This stark emptiness amplifies his feelings of isolation. When he realizes his solitude when he is in a state of almost dehydration, he despairs. As a result of the seclusion of the setting, having only seen ""One ramshackle shed in many miles,"" the cyclist almost loses hope. However, hope is renewed when he thinks of ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Oregon."" That is how the cyclist is affected by his setting, and despair is turned to hope."
493	6471	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it’s very hot outside, and he is starting to lose energy. The heat impacts his performance. The setting affects how fast he rides when he stops or when he drinks or eats; all of these depend on the type of weather he is riding in. Like in the story, it was so hot out that when he saw a building, he wiped the sweat from his face to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, illustrating the extreme conditions he was enduring. Therefore, the harsh environment significantly influences his perception and physical capabilities throughout his journey.
494	6472	3	3	In the essay ìDo not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî The features of the setting had a great affect on the hard-working cyclist. The weather land and surrounding objects really determined the cyclists mood and ability. One example would be the statement, ìcool pines, rushing rivers of upsemite had my name written all over them.î The refreshing nature and cool air made the cyclist feel confident energized and ready. Another example would be the quote, ìOne ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnít hold in the lamest Mule greet me.î There, the cyclist feels troubled and a little curious as to what lay ahead; this water wasn't the best, and he was worried about potential mechanical issues with his bike, too. The last example was, ìflat road was replaced by short rolling hills...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.î There, the cyclist tries to stay focused through distractions. It is deserted, and he feels dehydrated as well, making the ride more physically taxing. As his route ends, he comes across many more aspects of the setting which create a different feeling or ability. Therefore, the nature of where his bike passed, and the things he saw affected his choices and ability.
495	6473	3	3	There are many features in the setting that affect the cyclist, one of which is that he is in the middle of California riding his bike in the sun with a limited amount of water. The relentless sun beats down, and the dry air saps his energy. It affects the cyclist because he almost collapses from heatstroke and lack of water, highlighting how a seemingly simple bike ride can quickly become a struggle for survival against the harsh elements.
496	6474	3	3	The features of the setting in this essay affected the cyclist in many ways. ìOne ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnít hold in the lamest mule greeted me.î (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was expecting a small town with people in it and some type of good water supply. However he instead found a deserted ghost town with only a rusty pump that didnít even supply water. It made the cyclist feel depressed because he was running low on water and could easily dehydrate without it, adding to his physical and mental strain. ìThe speed limit was @NUM2. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM3. sometimes life can feel so cruel.î (Kurmaskie @NUM4). The cyclist is possibly being passed by cars on the highway going @NUM2 while he is only going @NUM3. This probably makes him feel as if he is getting nowhere at all, exacerbating his feelings of helplessness and isolation. It would be all the more reason for him to give up, as the contrast highlights his slow progress and vulnerability. But he keeps trying to reach his destination. The feeling of being passed by the cars makes him determined to continue and finish his journey, fueled by a desire to overcome the challenges presented by the harsh environment. Ultimately, the setting's bleakness both discourages and motivates the cyclist, shaping his experience and resolve.
497	6475	3	3	The cyclist had very little water left in his bottle. It was very hot, the sun beating down mercilessly. He still had a long way to go to reach his destination. The road was very bumpy, filled with potholes and loose gravel, so he couldn’t go too fast or his tires might bust. There were no cars in sight for miles, so if he did break down it would have taken even longer for help to arrive, compounding his already difficult situation.
498	6476	3	3	The setting effects the cyclist in many ways. And following old timers advice wasn't too smart of him. In that essay he was headed to the Yosemite National Park, he had a map to follow and he trusted himself, he a cyclist he knows his way around. But came around a couple of men who told him a shortcut. He trusted them which he shouldn't have and he was on his way. The setting was rough, with its own challenges. He was riding through a California desert; which was probably way too hot, and he was looking for water. The only thing that he found tasted like battery and so that was no good for him. It was a flat land, then rolling hills, making the journey even harder. The next town would have been in @NUM1 miles. This cyclist was killing himself, pushing beyond his limits. While riding along these lands there was nothing in sight, and no buildings or cars it was like a dead road. Those old men had led him through heck and back, and once he made it to the next town, he knew with those conditions that he would never trust a shortcut again.
499	6477	3	3	On the cyclist way to Yosemite National Park, he is given directions from a group of old men, but their directions aren’t so good. The deserted place affected him because there was nowhere for him to stop and eat or refill his water bottle. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” There were rusted water pumps, with hot water, but nothing to cool him down during the ride. His surroundings led him to the state of dehydration, worsening with each mile under the relentless sun.
500	6478	3	3	The features of the setting including vast emptiness, hills, heat, and no water all create obstacles for the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” Due to the vast emptiness of the area in which he was traveling, he could not stop somewhere to ask for help or to take a rest. Also there were no other travelers so he could not ask for assistance from them. Another obstacle during his trip are the hills. It takes more energy to pedal uphill so he ends up tiring easily and taking longer than expected. There is also extreme heat which causes him to sweat and become even more thirsty. So he ends up running out of water. In the story he writes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He is now becoming thirsty and if he doesn’t find water he will dehydrate. He searches for a place to rest where there will be water but he is not able to. All of these obstacles cause the cyclist to become devastated and give up hope, but he continues his travel and eventually finds a place to rest. All of these obstacles tying into another, compounding his difficulties and testing his resolve throughout his journey.
501	6479	3	3	I really thought the story didn't make sense; the setting was crazy, and I really wasn't feeling it at all. I don't think it was even a good story, as the plot seemed disjointed and the characters lacked believable motivations.
502	6480	3	3	"The features of the setting affect a cyclist in many ways. If you have a bumpy ride, then the cyclist will have a harder time. Also, if it is really hilly, then it is harder and will take longer too. ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" It will take him longer to reach his destination. Animals in the setting can also be effective. ""and a ridiculously, large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" Animals can get in the way like this snake did for the cyclist. If a squirrel or some kind of animal was to run across the road right in front of you, it could scare you and you could crash. Sometimes trees make it cooler because you don't have the sun beating directly down on your back. If there is a fresh water stream you can stop and wash all the sweat off of you and get a drink. The setting in which the cyclist is riding can help or hurt the cyclist, and these environmental factors ultimately impact their journey."
503	6481	3	3	It affected him by dehydrating him and wearing him down to the point where he was about to give up, his throat parched and muscles aching. But he never gave up, fueled by a deep-seated resolve. As the end satisfaction came out of it all, a wave of relief washed over him.
504	6482	3	3	The trees were in the landscape, and it was making the colors red, especially around the volcanoes. The tall pine trees covered in the distance were also in the landscape, and millions of years ago, what is now seen changed as the swampland became the desert, transforming the scenery.
505	6483	3	3	There were a few features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One very important feature is that the cyclist was in the desert. This is demonstrated by the statement ìI was travelling through the high deserts of California.î not only was the cyclist in the desert, he was there in June, one of the hottest months of the year. It is demonstrated that he was there in June reading to the statement ìI was travelling in June.î The heat at that time made dehydration a bigger risk. It was also very hot there. We know this because when he was at the water pump, he stated, ìblackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.î From this, we can affirm that not only was it hot, the water was dirty. The water also ìhad the flavor of battery acid.î This was bad for the cyclist who was running low on water because he ìhad been hitting (his) water bottles pretty regularly.î The fact that he had little water left is demonstrated in the statement, ìThe water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.î The cyclist was in a bad situation. These had ganged-up against him in his trip. These features are the desert, the high temperatures, and the blackish water which tasted like battery acid. The fact that he was low on water made it harder to fight these features with water, he would battle the desert, high temperatures, and have no need to pump bad water. Again, the features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the desert, the high temperatures, and the bad water which he could not drink, creating a formidable challenge for survival during his journey.
506	6484	3	3	In the story ìRough Road Aheadî the cyclist was excited and determined to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with ìHis name written over themî. The rough terrain and harsh weather took its affection on the unaware cyclist. The sun, beat down on the cyclist back, he tried to ignore it, but soon the heat made him frequently drink his water away to sips to drink. The cyclist was told by the old man a town was only 10 miles aways. The town was the traditional definition of a ghost town. That probably gave the cyclist no hope for surviving of finding anyone to help him reach his destination. The conditions of the roads, the lack of water which made him see a mirage, made the cyclist not trust the words of an old man who had led him to the abandon locations he had seen. The cyclist was affected by the settings in a bad way but in the end was given a little help from a traditional map, proving crucial to finding a slightly altered route.
507	6485	3	3	In the essay, ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because it made it more difficult for the cyclist to survive and make it through his journey. In the essay, it says, ìI arrived at the first ìTownîÖthis place might have been a thriving little spot at one timeÖbut on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost townî. In the essay, the cyclist takes directions from a few old men to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist has a limited amount of water, and it was a very humid day for traveling. Because of the humidity, the cyclist nearly ran out of water when he had to cycle up, ìshort, rolling hillsî in the hot weather. Had the town been thriving, he could have bought more water to make his trip easier to accomplish. Also, if the road in the story would have been flat, the cyclist wouldnít have gotten as tired as he did and needed more water. It would have been less strainful on the cyclist to pedal on a flat road rather than a hilly road. The challenges facing the cyclist reminded me of that of the main character of the movie *Cast Away*. In this movie, the main character must make his way through the extreme conditions of a deserted island, just like the cyclist had to in order to reach his destination. In conclusion, the setting clearly affects the cyclistís journey in a negative way.
508	6486	3	3	In the story, “Rough Road Ahead,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected by the setting. The cyclist has said that he had to ride over terrain that was smooth at first but then turned into rolling hills. He also had to find his way around a big snake while being dehydrated. The cyclist was mainly affected because he was out of water when he was riding on his bike through a desert-like area, but because he was determined to reach water he made it through. This challenging environment tested his physical and mental strength, but his resolve ultimately allowed him to overcome the harsh conditions.
509	6487	3	3	In the selection ìDo not exceed posted speed limitî there are a lot of great details of the area around the cyclist. In the text, it makes it clear that the route the cyclist is traveling is very deserted when the drinking water was explained as oozing out and tasting like battery acid, you can tell that people hadnít been there in awhile. Also, being informed that he was traveling through a desert, in June, I am able to understand how thirsty he is. Also, he is traveling for miles over a rough terrain and ìcrippling hills,î according to the text, so he has to be overly exhausted. The sun beating down relentlessly adds to the physical strain. I could understand why he was so upset with getting wrong directions based on the troubles he encounters when he finally reaches the camp and drinks water, you too are glad he has reached somewhere that wasnít empty and deserted. This sense of relief underscores the harshness of the journey.
510	6488	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was traveling through a hot place at a hot time of year and didn't have much water. In the text it says ""I was traveling the high desserts of California in June."" The deserts are always hot, and June is a very hot month, often with relentless sunshine. The cyclist was getting thirsty quicker from the heat and wasn't able to drink much because he had limited water, making the ride more difficult."
511	6489	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because since it was the California desert, and it was in June, it was very hot and dry. This caused him to get very thirsty and drink all his water. After almost all his water was gone, he began to get very tired, and since it is the desert, there isn’t anyone around to help him if he dehydrates and blacks out, so he has to persevere and really push through the situation if he wants to survive. Fortunately, he eventually finds a bait shop and he has a drink there, showing how crucial resources are in such an environment, and ensuring his well-being.
512	6490	3	3	In the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the setting greatly affects the cyclist. With long rides, hilly roads, and very little water the cyclist was pretty good. I mean he could have been very angry but he kept his cool and stayed calm. The relentless sun beat down, further testing his resolve. Despite the physical demands and scarcity of resources, he maintained composure, a testament to his mental fortitude. Ultimately, the harsh environment highlighted his resilience, preventing frustration from overwhelming him.
513	6491	3	3	The towns, the terrain, the Welchís Grape Juice factory- all are parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. ìThis place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war,î describes the cyclist, ìbut on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.î The town intensifies the cyclist feeling of doubt, in that it is increasing. At this part, he is really regretting taking the old guy's advice in taking the ìshortcut.î ìNot two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing,î reveals the cyclist. The cyclist is already very worried and very doubtful, and the terrain is making it worse; it mirrors the town in which the cyclist had stopped at earlier to, again make his feeling of doubt increase. The cyclist exclaims, ì By the looks of it- had been a Welchís Grape Juice Factory.î The cyclist gets very excited when he sees this, and gets a great feeling of hope. So throughout the whole story, the setting of where the cyclist is at affects his mood by giving him doubt, but by also giving him hope, demonstrating how environment can significantly impact one's emotional state.
514	6492	3	3	The cyclist was biking through the California deserts following the warm summer months. The heat and uninhabited canal was the biggest struggle for the cyclist. For example, he thought there would be many stops for water during his trip, but he was mistaken. Also, he ran out of water very quickly because of being dehydrated in the heat. The cyclist became irritated with himself for trusting someone else to give him directions for a shortcut. The arid setting affected the cyclist’s mood in a negative way, leaving him feeling stranded and increasingly despondent as the sun beat down.
515	6493	3	3	There were many features in the setting of this bike race that affected the cyclist. It stated, ìflat road was replaced by short, rolling hillsî (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was pedaling fine until these big hills came into affect and his energy was running lower as he went along, forcing him to exert more effort to maintain his pace. Also it stated,î At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snakeî (Kurmaskie @NUM2). This debris and snake made him stop because he got scared and slowed him down, disrupting his rhythm and focus. There was a lot of features in the setting that made the cyclist affected to slow him down and lose energy.
516	6494	3	3	Many things can effect a cyclist and how they ride, in this essay many things effected him such as the setting of the story. One of the problems of the setting was there were no stores or even people, another and most important thing was the lack of water around him. This isolation amplified the challenges he faced on his ride. So many things can effect a cyclist while they are riding inculding there suriondings, ultimately impacting their performance and endurance.
517	6495	3	3	"The second photograph better communicates ideas similar to the ideas expressed in the essay ""A sea worry,"" because the story is about a boy who surfs as a job & in the second picture a boy is surfing. The author says ""my son body-surfs. He says it’s his ‘job’."" That quote was explaining that he’s a body-surfer & it’s his occupation. Therefore, the visual representation of a surfer in the second photograph directly aligns with the son's described activity and profession within the essay, making it the more suitable choice."
518	6496	3	3	Condition the cyclist is in affect a lot of how they ride. One example of this is, ìI was travelling through the high desert of California in June.î Due to this fact the cyclist had went into a ìdehydrated stateî because of not having much water. When your travelling in hot weather areas without much water your body will become dehydrated from sweating. Cycling in different conditions will affect cyclists diffently, so preparation and awareness of environmental factors are essential for a safe and effective ride.
519	6497	3	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in ìRough Road Ahead.î First, the scorching heat of the desert in June was a major problem that had him to the brink of dehydration. The intense sun beat down relentlessly, sapping his strength. In the text it states, ìI could drop from heatstroke in a gorgeous day in June (@CAPS1).î This shows the effect the exposure to heat had on @NUM1 cyclist. Also, the terrain posed a threat to his well being during the story. The uneven and rocky ground made it difficult to maintain momentum. In the text it says ìI toiled on(@CAPS2).î This shows the increase in effort in strain the terrain caused on the cyclist during his adventure. Ultimately, the harsh environment significantly challenged the cyclist's endurance and ability to persevere.
520	6498	3	3	In the story ìDo not Exceed Posted Speed limitî by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being hot affected him because it made him more thirsty, and the relentless sun beat down, intensifying his dehydration. Then him being out in the middle of the desert made it so he couldnít get any water, with no signs of civilization or respite in sight. The hills made him tired and weak as he struggled against the inclines. All of the features in the setting had an affect on him, which made him powerless and thirsty, highlighting the harsh and unforgiving nature of his environment.
521	6499	3	3	The features that effect the cyclist are that he is riding his bike in the desert and doesnt have any water. That effects his journey because he is dehydrated so he needs to find water fast so it is making him get to Yosemite slower because he needs to find water, impacting his speed and route. That is a feature that affects the cyclist, ultimately hindering his progress.
522	6500	3	3	In the story the setting has a large affect on the cyclist. After taking advice from old people he ended up in the desert with no cars, buildings, or people. He was running low on water and had no way of getting anymore, and he was really dehydrated. Consequently, he got really tired and almost gave up because of the heat and lack of water. All this was caused by the harsh and unforgiving setting he was in, demonstrating the environment's powerful influence.
523	6501	3	3	The setting of the place was “ghost town” as the author said. It was a hot summer day in June, the sun beating down mercilessly, so of course the cyclist would be dehydrating. There was no one around, the empty buildings and deserted streets amplifying his isolation, so he couldn’t ask for help. It was like an old town, a relic of a bygone era, because he ran into old men who seemed out of touch, lost in time, and they knew nothing of the new world because they told him the wrong directions. His hope for reaching his destination dwindled with each incorrect turn, emphasizing the disorienting effect of the ghost town.
524	6502	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a few different ways. At first it helped him. ìThe sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed. The cool pines and rushing riversî This is saying the pines and rivers helped him forget the sun. Later on the setting was against him. There was no place to get water and he was becoming dehydrated as the day wore on and the terrain was getting rougher, making the ride more difficult. There were no people around to help him, but there was a snake slithering across the path, adding to his stress. All these features were working against him until he finally made it to a bait store, a welcome sight after the difficult journey. This bait store gave him water and a good map, turning his fortunes around and allowing him to continue his ride with renewed hope.
525	6503	3	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead by Joe @PERSON1 it tells of a cyclist heading for Yosemite National Park, and the problems he faced. For example the heat was a major issue the cyclist had to face. In the story it said “Drop from heatstroke,” illustrating how the challenging environment negatively impacted him. Indeed, the intense heat was a major element of the setting that significantly affected the character's journey, highlighting the difficult conditions he had to overcome to reach his destination.
526	6504	3	3	The features of the setting affected the authorís story a lot. It affected it by making the trip seem more difficult to the reader. This was made possible by telling how hot it was and explaining how the road was full of bumps or hills. The story says ìover one long, crippling hill.î This makes the reader think the trip is very hard since he has to ride up so many hills. But if the road wasnít as hilly then the trip would seem less difficult. This would also make it as if that the old guys gave good directions. But the whole point of the difficult setting is to show how arduous the journey was, influencing the reader's perception of the events.
527	6505	3	3	As soon as the cyclist gained information about which way to go, he set off through tall, cool pines. They gave him a feeling of confidence, and physically cooled his body down. As he headed down the road, he encountered various small towns—none of which looked promising—which gave him a feeling of despair, in accordance to his lack of water. Even further into the journey, he found one last town, and a rundown welcheís factory. This increased his thirst and gave him a feeling of spite towards the old men who had given him advice. However, he soon found a bait house where he could get water and escape the heat. For this he was satisfied and grateful to the owner, solidifying his resolve to never again trust the old men.
528	6506	3	3	The setting affects a lot in a cyclist. For example, if you are in a city, you feel rushed, tired, and overwhelmed. But in a forest, you are happy and a bit less stressed because of the calm and nature. A setting sets the mood and also the attitude in the story; it influences the cyclist's experience and therefore their perspective. Thus, the environment deeply shapes not only physical feelings but also emotions.
529	6507	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the author's disposition as well as his ability to complete the journey, thus creating an obstacle the author must overcome. At the end of paragraph five, the author writes that ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California."" This setting is important because it adds a sense of urgency to his trip when he starts to run low on water, making the journey more perilous. This is similar to when I was backpacking and a bear got most of our food; our normal backpacking trip had become more of a game of survival. So, the water issue was clearly the main point of conflict that the author presented in the setting. He also writes that ""Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This aspect of the setting also affects the cyclist because it makes it much harder for him to progress than if it was a downhill road, impacting his stamina and speed. In short, the setting of the story presents the main points of conflict to the author and thus was essential to the essay."
530	6508	3	3	In the essay, ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î the unbearable setting effects the cyclist with its harsh conditions. At first, in the cyclistís own words, ì things began well enough.î However, this soon changes. The road is long and filled with obstacles, like jagged rocks and relentless hills, and the cyclist has hardly any water to sip. He does not give up, though; in the text it says, ìgot back on the bike, but not bothered gathered up a few peldder and stuck them in my mouth.î He does this in order to reduce his need for water and continues, ignoring the toll the setting brings upon him, demonstrating a remarkable resilience in the face of adversity. This shows his determination to push forward despite the challenging environment.
531	6509	3	3	"The cyclist is affected by the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead"" because the road is a place, and if it is rough or unknown, it directly affects the traveler, who is the cyclist. If it is a hill, then the cyclist would have to climb it, expending more energy. In the text it said, ""over a long crippling hill,"" the ""crippling hill"" part stresses that the setting is a hill, and the word ""crippling"" suggests the difficulty the cyclist faces due to the terrain. This demonstrates the setting's impact."
532	6510	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there is no water, hills, and deserts. When the cyclist saw water, wanting to jump in, all he thought about was that the water they did have tasted like battery acid. Then the hills slowed him down, making it harder to reach any potential water source. The desert just amplified his thirst and made him want water even more intensely. These harsh environmental elements significantly impacted the cyclist's physical and mental state throughout his journey.
533	6511	3	3	There were many features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One was the extreme heat during the June heat in California. The speaker said that he could have died from heatstroke. The rough road was also a problem for the cyclist. The bumps, hills and wildlife affected the cyclistís journey. The thing that most affected him was the lack of water. It was such a problem that he had to suck on stones to take his mind off thirst. As you can see, these problems in the story affected the speakerís journey to Yosemite National Park.
534	6512	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is riding in the desert where there is low to no rain. This means that he can’t collect any water to drink if he runs out. Also, deserts are hot, the sun beating down relentlessly. The heat will speed up the dehydration process so he will need more water to survive. If he runs out of water, he will die a slow, agonizing death. The cyclist finds a building, but it is abandoned and empty, offering no respite. All these features of the setting affect him. Since he can’t find water, he has to conserve what he has, rationing every drop. Also, the heat is killing him, sapping his strength. It doesn’t help to have an abandoned building be the only one he finds, a cruel reminder of his isolation. During the whole time that there is death in the air, the desert with nothing growing, no water, the cyclist is thinking about his death, his mind consumed by despair. As long as he thinks about his death, there is only more death, his hope dwindling with each passing moment. As soon as he puts the pebbles in his mouth to stop thinking about death and being thirsty, focusing on the physical sensation instead, he sees a bait shop which saves his life, a beacon of hope in the desolate landscape. He thought about surviving, and immediately found a shop to quench his thirst, proving the profound impact of mindset on his fate, highlighting how a shift in perspective turned his survival.
535	6513	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his ride. ìThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke (pG @NUM1 kurmaskie).î This quote is saying that because of the heat, the rough terrain and the length of his ìshortcutî his running out of water. Thatís when he realizes he could die from heatstroke because he listened to a bunch of old men. The harsh environment, combined with his dwindling supplies, underscored the severity of his situation and the potential consequences of his decision.
536	6514	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is in the desert and has a low supply of water. Without water, he tires very easily. On top of that, he has to pedal a bicycle. So, he is thirsty and tired from being in the desert. This is how the setting affected the cyclist, creating a challenging and exhausting ordeal due to the harsh environment and limited resources.
537	6515	3	3	Setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist has to worry about the road condition. If the road condition is bad then the cyclist must reduce his/her speed. The cyclist also has to worry about if it is day or night. If it is night, they must be careful due to cars not being able to see them, perhaps by using reflective gear or lights. In the text, the cyclist was in extremely hot weather. This is dangerous to cyclist if they are not prepared with things such as water, and could potentially lead to heatstroke. Therefore, awareness of the setting is crucial for a cyclist's safety.
538	6516	3	3	"The setting affects the cyclist because he believes that he has a nice, short, flat distance to travel to get to Yosemite, but instead, it is a long, hilly(rough), hot journey. He only prepared himself for a quick ride, bringing only enough water for that ride, and wasn't prepared for the reality of his ride. First of all, he is riding in the middle of the day (the hottest part) in the ""high deserts of California in June."" I know when I go to camp here in Lone Pine during the summer, I drink six to seven liters, but the author only mentions a ""few bottles of water,"" which aren't going to help him in that heat. Secondly, the cyclist believed that the old men had given him a safe path to follow, but instead, he came across a ""ridiculously large snake. It really looked like a diamond back."" That is a poisonous snake, and the cyclist was barely able to ""ease past"" it because of his lack of water. Lastly, the cyclist expected the old men to give him an easy path on a flat terrain when, in fact, it was ""replaced by short, rolling hills,"" which means you have to put more effort (using more water) to climb the hills. The setting definitely affects the cyclist because it makes it more difficult for him to reach his destination, but without a few bumps in the road, how is he to learn a life lesson?"
539	6517	3	3	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting a lot. For example the dry hot place makes him thirsty. Then the ghost towns make it hard to get supplies. Also the bad road slowed him down. The bad roads even would probably hurt him and his bike; the roads also would make him work harder, expending more energy to navigate the uneven terrain and potential hazards. Therefore, the environment significantly impacts the cyclist's journey, influencing his physical state and the challenges he faces.
540	6518	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many bad ways. For example in the text it says how “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”. This shows the cyclist was struggling to navigate the terrain while also battling physical discomfort. Meaning that he had trouble being in a place he didn’t know well and he was dehydrated, making the ride more difficult. In conclusion the setting did affect the cyclist.
541	6519	3	3	First the bike encounters flat roads in the desert which are very easy to navigate through; when he gets to his first town he still goes on trying to get to Yosemite, then after is going low so he looks for some more water to help him go. Then he kept going and he experienced a fork in the road. After the fork he kept going and he then faced another problem: an old person told him to go @NUM1 miles to the town and he didn’t trust the guy. The biker, after some hesitation, listened and he went on down the road. He then faced his next problem: the flat road started to get very wary with short high and low hills. These hills reduced his stamina greatly. Then he had to deal with a rocky and bumpy desert road. He then had to face a snake and he had to avoid it so it didn’t attack him. Finally the biker faced his last long hill and, thankfully, he found a bait and tackle shop with lots of water, enabling him to replenish his supplies and continue his journey.
542	6520	3	3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting, exacerbating his discomfort. The cyclist is lost, has only found dirty water, and is moving on rough ground. The features of the setting are “cool pines and rushing rivers,” however, the cyclist comes to find that the “rushing river” is not so refreshing when he tries to drink it. He also encounters a terrain change, from flat road to short, rolling hills that make his journey harder. There is a sign, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” also the name of the passage with a limit of 55 mph, while the cyclist is only going 12 mph, further emphasizing his slow progress. Ironically, he finds a picture of a boy drinking grape juice at the factory, which causes him to hang his head in misery due to his intense thirst, highlighting his suffering. Finally, he comes to a fish camp, where he encounters the owner who, ironically, tells him he'd be better off using his map, underscoring the cyclist's misdirection and compounding his frustration. Thus, the environment serves to amplify the cyclist's negative experience.
543	6521	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is going to be on the road a long time. The features of no buildings, no people and no cars, affect on the rider is that he feels helpless when he is low on water because there is no one to ask for assistance. The ghost town doesn’t help him because the old man told him about it and he thought he would be able to get more water, but there was nothing there. The grape juice factory affected him because he thought he would get a drink but it was abandoned, crushing his hopes. These environmental factors combined to significantly impact the cyclist's journey, particularly as his resources dwindled and the promise of finding supplies proved false.
544	6522	3	3	Features of the setting would affect me if I was the cyclist because, I would be thinking I was going to die just like he did because there is nothing to look at, no breeze, wind, he seen a snake, he had no water. He went through three towns that had nothing. The sun was setting down on him, it was hot, he had no hope left. The desolation of the landscape, the oppressive heat, and the lack of resources all contribute to a feeling of despair. Who knows, maybe if he would have just went with what the map had said, he would have been fine, ultimately highlighting how the environment's harshness, coupled with poor decisions, led to his predicament.
545	6523	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is running out of water and is in the intense heat in the high deserts of California in June. The tumbleweeds that cross his path add to the desperation. Not only do the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically by dehydrating him in the heat, but also mentally. The sun beats down mercilessly, and the dry air saps his strength. The cyclist encounters rolling hills, tumbleweeds, rattlesnakes, and ghost towns. Each hill climbed feels like a monumental effort. The sight of abandoned buildings whispers of failure, and the threat of rattlesnakes keeps him on edge. All of these make the cyclist start to give up hope. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically and mentally.
546	6524	3	3	The features of the setting greatly impacted the cyclist. First the setting at the middle of the story was empty and no place to get water. This filled the cyclist with doubt and despair, he/she thought they would die from dehydration. The setting also made the cyclist thirsty because of the extreme heat radiating off the barren landscape. Finally the cyclist was filled with regret because they regretted listening to the old men; the cyclist didn’t make it where he/she wanted to go and was now stranded. Therefore, the environment played a critical role in shaping the cyclist's emotional and physical state, ultimately leading to feelings of remorse.
547	6525	3	3	The author thinks that the desolate setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there were still people around. He panicked and thought he was going to die. The places were deserted and he thought the trails led nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because everything around him was in a sense dead, with the dry landscape and lack of any visible life contributing to the feeling of impending doom, solidifying the fear.
548	6526	3	3	The setting really affected the cyclist. Since he was in the desert on a bike he was going to be hot and tired. Which would come from the sun coming down on him. He was hot where it said ìwide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt,î and the relentless sun beat down on his exposed skin. This really shows how the desert environment impacted his physical state.
549	6527	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they are extreme and do not change. The cyclist was riding on a small road in the desert. In the desert it was very hot, the sun beating down relentlessly, and because of this the cyclist was sweating a lot and getting dehydrated. Also because he was in the desert, with its vast and featureless landscape, he had no sense of direction. Also the towns are all run down with nothing in them, so the cyclist couldn’t get any water to drink to rehydrate himself, the abandoned buildings offering no respite. Only when he comes to a small bait shop close by did he finally get water. Therefore, the unchanging and harsh desert environment is the key element affecting the cyclist's struggle.
550	6528	3	3	"The setting really affected the cyclist a lot. The sun and hot weather dehydrated him. He also had pretty much ran out of water. In the story he says, ""The bottles contained only a few drops,"" this shows that he had drank almost all of his water. Then it says, ""the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke"" shows the heat was affecting him, pushing him to his physical limits and highlighting the challenging conditions he faced."
551	6529	3	3	The setting was calm and peaceful as he started out riding his bike. He was smiling and his legs were strong. As he hit the @NUM1 town and saw a ramshackled shed, rusty pumps, and a corral, he begun to be troubled b/c he was running out of water. As the flat rodes were replaced wI short, rolling hills he became even more troubled. When he saw a building he became happy but when he found out it was run down he was sad, thirsty, and tired. When he finally saw an old man and told him he had a map he became a little happier b/c he was going to get to Yosemite. As the setting became worse his mood became worse b/c he had less and less water and felt very hopeless. But when he saw the man he became happy b/c the map was going to help him, giving him hope that he would make it to his destination after all.
552	6530	3	3	The setting of this story is very rigorous. At the beginning of the story, the boy was fine. He had a bottle of water with him so that he didn't get dehydrated. When he was riding, he started to feel the sun get higher into the sky, though he could barely feel it because of the pines that shaded the road, and the cool feel of the river. The cyclist got to the second town on his journey and he had been drinking his water all day and was about out. He had found a water pump. He got down on his knees and pumped with all his might, but all that came out was brackish water. He just feared the water and stated that it tasted like battery acid. He began to ride again. Not two miles up the road, the terrain changed. Not only was it rolling hills, it was also getting hotter. He was majorly dehydrated because he was out of water except for a few tantalizing sips. Dry sweat circled his shirt and he was afraid he could suffer a heatstroke. Where he was at was in the middle of nowhere, with no buildings, cars, or structures in sight. Over one of the hills, he saw a building come into view. He wiped the sweat off his eyes to make sure it was not a mirage. By the looks of it, it had been a Welch's factory. He was so dehydrated and tired that he could see a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth. There is only one problem: it is abandoned. This person was imagining things. He got back on his bike and stuck pebbles into his mouth. This was to help take his mind off being thirsty. In this harsh environment, the cyclist's desperation underscores the power of thirst and the mind's capacity to conjure illusions when pushed to its limits.
553	6531	3	3	I read ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî written by Joe Kurmaskie in the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist by accepting advice from ìold timers who havenít left the confines of their porches @CAPS1 was in officeî. The relentless sun beating down and the cracked, uneven asphalt present immediate physical challenges, while the locals' outdated counsel further hinders progress, creating a disconnect between the cyclist's expectations and the harsh realities of the road. Ultimately, the environment shapes the cyclist's experience, forcing adaptation and highlighting the contrast between perceived wisdom and practical application.
554	6532	3	3	In the essay ìDo not exceed posted speed limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First, the sun is making the cyclist hot and dehydrated. He states ìThe sun was beginning to beat down,î and as a result, the cyclist had to ration his water. Also, the hills of the country roads forced him to exert more energy. Going up and down hills take alot of work you have to use alot of energy. The cyclist says ìlong flat stretches were replaced by short, rolling hills.î These hills demanded more from him physically. Furthermore, there were snakes in the road, which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit. Againg the cyclist states ìa dimond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.î He was constantly on alert. Moreover, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes. The factory even made him more thirsty. In conclusion, there were many affects on the cyclist due to the setting, creating a challenging and emotionally taxing ride.
555	6533	3	3	"The features of the setting take their toll on the unfortunate cyclist. For example, I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. The deserts of California especially in June are hot and dry and caused the cyclist to use much of his water supply very quickly. As he ""toiled"" on, the terrain features became even more trying, over one long, crippling hill. By this time the cyclist barely had enough energy to make it over a hill from all the wear and tear his body was put through by the features of his setting, proving just how detrimental the environment can be."
556	6534	3	3	The setting to this story has an encouraging impact on this story, because he is alike ride. The terrain in the story sounds rough where he seen a sign marked, ëRough road ahead do note exceed posted speed limit.î He already has to go up and down hills with rocks and no water. Such a setting and a really athletic ride can be devastating, but also makes the journey all the more rewarding as he overcomes each obstacle.
557	6535	3	3	The feature of the cyclist and the settings aren't that good. There are incidents that are a problem. One is the bad weather. There is a temperature that makes it feel pretty close to 100 degrees. He stops at a water pump, water comes out but it is really not cool. He takes two little sips and it's like battery acid. If he were to drink a lot of that water it would probably kill him or make him very ill. He needs something because there was another town 20 miles down the road so he has to find something to keep him going. As he is going down the road he sees a sign: Rough Road Ahead. Even though he is going 12 mph he could still hit a hole and go flying over his handle bars. If he does go over his handle bars he could run into the snake he saw then get eaten by the birds because he wouldn't have any energy to get up. There are some interesting scenes in the story, but these issues detract from the overall experience.
558	6536	3	3	Heat, water supply, energy-all are features of setting that can affect a cyclist. First, is heat. When it is too warm out it makes it more difficult, and more inconvenient to ride. Second, is your water supply. If you are riding, and begin to run low on water, you're in trouble. The author describes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips”. If you aren't prepared enough for your cycling journey, it will be extremely inconvenient when you run out of supplies. Planning your water stops or carrying enough hydration is essential. Lastly, is energy. If you run out of energy while cycling, you have nothing. Your energy is what keeps you moving and motivated. “With what I believe, was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” the author describes. Proper nutrition and pacing are crucial for maintaining stamina. When you are out of energy, your ride is over. All of these aspects are important to have before deciding to go on a cycling journey, highlighting the need to consider environmental factors and personal preparedness for a successful and safe cycling experience.
559	6537	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by dehydrating him due to the heat and lack of water, causing him to see mirages. He loses strength going over the many hills, which sap his energy. And there is a very large snake he has to ride by that could have bitten him, posing a significant threat. These environmental challenges greatly impact the cyclist's journey.
560	6538	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when you have hills to climb and little water, you will get dehydrated, impacting performance. Also the heat from the desert is so hot that it also can make you dehydrated, causing fatigue and potential heatstroke. If you don’t pace yourself and don't drink enough water, rationing it strategically, you will be less likely to reach your goal. Your rest is a big thing for if you don't have energy, you will not get far, as muscle recovery and alertness are crucial for navigating the challenging terrain and extreme conditions, ultimately hindering your success.
561	6539	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the hills made it hard for him to ride his bike up and he was breathing heavily as he pedaled. He was also afraid of the grass because it was tall and scary looking, making him think something might be hiding in it. These environmental factors influenced his ride.
562	6540	3	3	In the story ìDo not exceed Posted Speed limitî a cyclist takes a journey through terrain to get to Yosemite. In that part of California there are not a lot of towns or people. The road he is riding on is very dangerous and long. It is very dry and hot out there, but he presses onward despite the harsh conditions.
563	6541	3	3	The setting can affect a cyclist in a lot of ways. One way setting affects cyclist is when it is hot, it is harder to cycle long distances. I say this because in the story the narrator says “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke…” This illustrates how the environmental conditions, particularly high temperatures, can pose a significant threat to a cyclist's physical well-being and endurance. Another part of setting that affects cyclist is the terrain they cycle on. For example it is much easy to cycle on flat smooth ground than it is on the rolling hills with rough, rocky ground. This is shown with the quote “ride down into distances I could see over the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” The challenging terrain influences the cyclist's mental state and the goals they set for themselves. Setting can have a great deal of affect on a cyclist, depending on if its smooth or rocky, or hot or cool.
564	6542	3	3	In Joe Kurmaskieís ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed the Speed Limitî the features of the setting affects the cyclist a great deal. Each feature causing the cyclist to act. For example, in reaching the ëramshackle shedí the cyclist finds the water unusable; which causes him to conserve water and try to head for the next town. That action leads him deeper into the high deserts of California during June. Also as the terrain changes from flat road to short, rolling hills the cyclist must change his speed to better survive and continue in his dehydrated state. He downshifts, expending more energy to conquer the inclines, knowing the descents offer little respite in his weakened condition. The scarcity of buildings in this dry desert terrain causes the cyclist to try every ëshack or building he comes across for water. He risks time and energy hoping for a resupply. In this story the features of the setting dictates the actions of the cyclist in his quest to survive in the desert a lot.
565	6543	3	3	The cyclist in the essay, ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî is about a great adventure gone bad. He has every thing he needs but some how it turns out bad. He get low on water & the setting is horrible. He is on his way from a camp ground in Bridgeport, California to the Yosemite river. He gets bad directions from old guys at the camps ground. On his way he ran into two abandon towns & was running out of water then he came to a sign that said, ìRough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.î He was pedeling over hills & becoming dehydrated when he tought he was going to die he came to a bait shop & got waiter & met an old guy who was going to give him direction & he decided he better stick to the map. Even though the setting got worse through the story & stuck it out & made it to the end, ultimately demonstrating resilience in the face of adversity.
566	6544	3	3	Heat, hills and ghost towns ñ all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, the oppressive heat dehydrates and exhausts him, almost causing him a heat stroke. He starts drinking more often, desperately trying to replenish his fluids, and nearly runs out of water. Next are the relentless hills. They can take massive amounts of energy to climb, forcing him to strain every muscle in his legs. Which adds to his dehydration, making each upward push a monumental effort. Finally, the desolate ghost towns. They make his journey seem hopeless, amplifying his feelings of isolation and fatigue. Which could cause him to lose the will to carry on, questioning whether reaching his destination is even possible. These combined elements of the environment present formidable obstacles.
567	6545	3	3	The cyclist is in the desert which @NUM1 degrees with water that tastes like battery acid. The relentless sun beats down, blurring the already hazy horizon. The desert makes him see the mirages, shimmering pools that vanish upon approach, the cruel tricks of heat and exhaustion. Sweat stings, finding its way into his eyes, momentarily blinding him with a salty film.
568	6546	3	3	In the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the author tells a story about when he took advice from “old folks” and became lost. The setting greatly affected him and his journey, for example “tumbleweeds crossed my path, and a ridiculously large snake…” and a “crippling hill.” These quotes explain that the setting was quite desolate and, at times, scary, contributing to the feeling of isolation and uncertainty that the author experienced as he strayed further from the familiar highway. The unfamiliar landscape served as a constant reminder of his misjudgment.
569	6547	3	3	He’s in a very hot climate, in a desert, so he needs lots of water, but he has a limited supply. The sun beats down mercilessly, baking the sand and reflecting heat back up. He's riding on hills, which makes it even harder, each incline a draining effort under the scorching sun. He can’t find any towns that aren’t abandoned, their empty buildings standing as silent testaments to the harshness of the land, offering no respite or chance to replenish his dwindling water. Therefore, his situation is becoming increasingly precarious.
570	6548	3	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way it affected him was time because of the rough road he had to go slower so it took him longer to get to the town. Also because the road was harder to peddle on he got thirsty and the water from his bottle was really hot from the sun beating down on it. Ultimately, the harsh environment posed challenges for the cyclist, influencing his journey and comfort.
571	6549	3	3	There were several features of the setting that held an affect on the cyclist in this story. For one, the cyclist was riding in a hot desert. This condition normally prevents one from obtaining water. Seeing as how water was a necessity for the cyclist, the lack there at due to the desert created the conflict of dehydration. Additionally, the town that was abandoned triggered a spark of doubt in the cyclist’s mind. The cyclist now had to ride with his brain in doubt and his body in desperate hope. By the time he/she reaches the old factory, the cyclist is extremely dehydrated, his lips cracked and vision blurring. Now his head is screaming with annoyance and his body is screaming with lack of water. This abandoned juice factory almost completely wiped out the cyclist hope. A man is little to nothing without hope. Therefore, this abandoned factory had a negative affect on him. Now, the only reason he continues is out of his/her desperation of survival, an instinct in all of us. In conclusion, the desert removed water and the abandoned homes and factory removed hope and all three created a negative affect, making the journey a true test of endurance. The cyclist is lucky to have survived.
572	6550	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist, because he didn’t know if he was going to die or live. He had used up all his water because it was so hot and his mouth was dry. The sun beat down mercilessly on the barren landscape, creating a shimmering haze on the road ahead, further intensifying his anxiety.
573	6551	3	3	In the short story ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, he shows features of the setting played that affects the cyclist in many different ways. A setting the cyclist faces is that its so hot he keeps drinking water, and worrying that he is going to run out. Kurmaskie writes, ì I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in 1984). He even mentions the sun beating down, further emphasizing the oppressive heat. This is what the cyclist gets affected by throughout the whole story as he realizes he could die of heatstroke if he doesn't watch how much water he's drinking. Also, this is what a lot of people normally face which is a challenge cause of dehydration, revealing how the harsh environment presents a tangible threat and underscores the cyclist's vulnerability. The constant need for hydration becomes a central conflict, shaping his decisions and highlighting the precariousness of his journey through the scorching desert.
574	6552	3	3	With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place, things change. A better piece of advice for the solo cyclist? Never take travel advice from old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. Rough road ahead. Do not exceed the posted speed limit. Essentially, adapt to the present conditions and heed immediate warnings rather than relying on outdated perspectives.
575	6553	3	3	Many things about the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. The terrain in this story is hilly and filled with deserts. This contributes to the cyclist’s nagging sensation for a drink of water, as the arid climate exacerbates his thirst. The ride on the hills and through the desert also tire him out dramatically. Not to mention while he is severely dehydrated, and when he finds the water it is “tarlike” and “in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” The cyclist in this story really must want to get Yosemite National park if he is willing to go through all this trouble. The old men he asked in Lodi, California hadn’t left the town in decades and gave the cyclist faulty directions that could have killed him. So he asked for directions and was given inadequate information, which made life very difficult for the cyclist, ultimately emphasizing the challenging and unforgiving nature of his journey.
576	6554	3	3	The setting of ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î affect the cyclist so many ways. First of all, the cyclist is riding in a desert, in mid- June, with the heat ìbeginning to beat downî on him. This feature of the setting causes the cyclist to drink more water, but when his supply of water was running low, he was unable to drink much water to hydrate himself, leading to discomfort. The cyclist began to realize that he ìcould trap from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.î Moreover, the long distance and changes in the terrain that the cyclist was travelling, affected him. The distance on which to cyclist was travelling to Yosemite National Park, consisted of hours and miles of riding, testing his endurance. Over vast changes of terrain. The ìflat road was replaced by short, rolling hillsî, which affected the cyclist speed and energy to finish his trip, making the journey more physically demanding. Thus, the harsh environment and challenging landscape significantly impacted the cyclist's experience, influencing his hydration, physical exertion, and overall sense of vulnerability.
577	6555	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making him go the wrong direction, influenced by an old man. One crucial feature was the tough, ghost-town-like environment. The old people in the town, unknowingly ghosts, gave him incorrect directions. This misdirection made it harder for him because that led to more difficult roads and less water. He almost died due to these harsh conditions and bad information, highlighting how the setting contributed to his near-fatal experience.
578	6556	3	3	The features of the setting will affect the cyclist because the roads are hilly, and he is old, so it will be hard for him to ride up them. The sun beat down relentlessly; it was very hot, and he had a scarce supply of water. Dehydration began to take its toll; he was seeing things that weren't there. When he did try to get some water, the weather was so hot that the water from the pump came out hot, offering no relief. This harsh environment clearly presents significant challenges to the cyclist given his age and limited resources.
579	6557	3	3	Well some features of the setting like the hotness is effecting the cyclist, for example he was riding through the high deserts of California and was drinking too much of his water. So when he stopped at a place the pipes and things to get water were rusty and old, offering little hope for refreshment. Another was when he thought he could make it to the other town to get water there. He started his ride, but the roads were hilly and short, sapping his energy quickly. Then the road turned into bumpy terrain too, making the journey even more arduous. So no matter what he was doing, he was having bad trouble anyway, highlighting the harsh and unforgiving nature of his environment.
580	6558	3	3	The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name all over them. Soon though, the path narrowed, the trees grew sparse, and a disquiet settled in. A nagging thought tugged at the edges of my mind: where was everyone else? The terrain turned unforgiving, sharp rocks replacing the soft earth.
581	6559	3	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance the desert is not a humid environment, making its lack of water a bigger deal than normal because the cyclist will lose more water through sweat. Also these are many hills, making him have to use full force to get up them, also making water a big deal because exertion increases the need for hydration. The harsh sun also drains his energy faster. In conclusion if temperatures where level and it was flat land he could go further with less water supply.
582	6560	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by never accepting travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left their porches since Carter was in office. After that, because you don’t know if they are a real collection or what. After, because some people have not left their porches since Carter was in office, it is hard to rely on their outdated perspective. I don’t know why people have not left their porches since Carter was in office, but their advice is probably unreliable.
583	6561	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Aheadî by Joe Kurmaskie he accepts directions from old men for a shortcut to Yosemite National Park. He ends up cycling in a desert with no water just barley able to push the pedals of his bike. The setting affects the cyclist by it being so hot, him not having anything to drink, nowhere to get water or food and him maybe seeing mirages. In the essay it states, ìWide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke.î This shows that the lack of water and the surrounding enviroment with nowhere to go is making him give up hope to survive. The relentless heat saps his strength, making each pedal stroke an act of sheer will. It also says in the essay, ìI wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasenít a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. ìThe cyclist is coming out himself and stating that the dessert has him thinking hes seeing something and letting him down by it not being real. The vast, unforgiving desert not only challenges him physically but also plays tricks on his mind. The desert setting of this essay effects the cyclist in many ways other then one, ultimately testing his physical and mental limits in a desperate struggle for survival.
584	6562	3	3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affected the cyclist because he was thirsty and he thought he was going to die. In this case he had no water left and he was in the desert. He was regretting not taking the advice of the stranger and was dying of thirst. Also, he didn't have the mindset that he wanted to live, which was exacerbated by the harsh, unforgiving landscape surrounding him. The relentless sun and barren environment further contributed to his despair and physical distress. That's how I think the setting affected him.
585	6563	3	3	The features of the setting have a big impact on the cyclist. One feature is the hot weather and area he is in. He says he is in the “high deserts of California in June.” Being hot in California, it has the cyclist is around deserts, causing more heat. “I could drop from a heatstroke,” he says. Being hot from the sun beating down on him took away the cyclist’s energy he needs for riding his bike, hindering his performance. Another feature that affected the cyclist was his lack of water. “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This affected the cyclist by making him tired. Being tired from no water, the cyclist had trouble going up hills on his bike. The last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” These hills made it hard to go up on a bike, considering his lack of water and the heat, further draining his limited reserves. All of these features affect the cyclist by making him lose energy and get tired and frustrated because of their negative impact, creating a challenging and potentially dangerous situation for him.
586	6564	3	3	Nature has an affect on everyone, even when they don’t think it does. Especially for cyclists traveling anywhere or everywhere. In “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie is a perfect example about settings that affect people like cyclists. When you’re riding your bike as actual cross country transportation, you have to know what you’re doing and where you’re going. The cyclist in this story decided to take advice from older fellows and ends up going the wrong route for a cyclist because at these “towns” they had no water, because they weren’t towns to begin with, not anymore at least. If you don’t have any water like this guy did, hills could kill you. And in any case, you have to know what to do for example. “I gathered a few pebbles and struck them in my mouth. I’d read once that sucking on stones help take your mind off thirst.” This guy knew a little bit of survival tips. If he’d gone all that way without standing up to his thirst and those hills, he probably would have had some kind of stroke. That is just a few ways that setting could harm you, highlighting how crucial environmental awareness and preparation are for cyclists.
587	6565	3	3	Some of the feature setting that effect the cyclist was the seal was begging to lent down, but he truly noticed it and about twenty miles up the road he came to park of sorts. The cyclist was riding through the high deserts of California in June. He get on his hands and hence working on the heated handle of the rusty pump. The pump began it shoot out a tarlike substance and the water was feeling somewhere of two hundred degrees. Two more miles I noticed the terrain changing from a flat road to a short, rolling hills. He said tumble weeds crossed her path and a large snake crossed her pavement. He gather some pebbles and stuck them in his mouth, after reading that if sucking of stones helps to be your mind off thirst. Well after reading of I believed these settings did effect the cyclist.
588	6566	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, the town the cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town. Although the cyclist chuckles about it, this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has ahead of him, suggesting isolation and a lack of readily available support. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist. For example, ""I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on, requiring less exertion. The change from flat land to hills affected his stamina and will to keep going, demanding more physical effort. He really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill, battling fatigue. His determination finally led him to, ""Gary and Wilber's Fish camp…"" (pg @NUM2). He finally found hope, signaling a potential respite from the arduous journey and a chance to recover. Thus, the challenging terrain and initial desolation significantly impacted the cyclist's physical and mental state, making the discovery of the fish camp a crucial turning point."
589	6567	3	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the ride had a largely negative effect on the cyclist. The cyclist grew fatigued due to the arduous hills he encountered, and though he appreciated the scenery, it was the only positive aspect of his journey. ""The water bottle only contained a few tantalizing sips,"" highlighting his insufficient hydration and resulting thirst. Furthermore, ""At some point a ridiculously large snake—it really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement,"" creating a dangerous situation where a bite was a real possibility, despite being on a bicycle. All these points demonstrate the detrimental impact the challenging environment had on the cyclist's overall experience."
590	6568	3	3	The desert-like land affected the cyclist by making him tired and causing loss of body water, therefore making him need water to go on. I think the thought of being so thirsty made him become more weak. If he wasn't thinking about it, the ride wouldn't have been so rough; the mental burden exacerbated the physical strain, making the challenge even greater.
591	6569	3	3	In the cyclistís outlook on his journey through Yosemiteís park, readers can get a good feel of how it might be to be riding right along side. It seems that it is very beautiful along the bike ride, giving you a sense of natural wonder. He sees such a vast variety of scenery including rivers, sandy dry deserts also, as well as cool pines and trees in the park part. He said it was also breezy which probably made for an enjoyable temperature, enhancing the overall experience of the ride. Overall, it sounds like a very satisfying and scenic cycling experience.
592	6570	3	3	The features of the bike ride to Yosemite through California in June affect the cyclist. Some of the features were it was hot high deserts, and no water. This affected the author by making him dehydrated and tired, which made it hard for him to find water or to get to Yosemite. The relentless sun and arid landscape presented significant challenges. In this case the author says “The sun was beating down on me”. The author is hot from the sun. He says “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips”. He is showing how he has no water and is probably dehydrated. All of those features are affecting the way he is traveling and getting to water, highlighting the demanding conditions of the journey and their impact on his progress and well-being, making the trip exceptionally difficult.
593	6571	3	3	In the essay, ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî there are many features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. Many of these features affect him in a negative way. One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî ìThe speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.î The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it, especially given his depleted state. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony, taunting him with the refreshment he desperately craved. Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist. ìI had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.î This shows the cyclist was extremely grateful for a place to stop and rest. All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end, when the prospect of the bait shop offered a glimmer of hope.
594	6572	3	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, the heat was the main part of nature that threw him off. It caused him to go dehydrated because of the lack of water, and he went kind of delirious. He thought he was seeing things, and his vision was distorted by the heat. Next, the water he had to come across in the pump was undrinkable because of the tarlike substance coming out of it and the degree of water he said it was, which was 103 degrees. Lastly, the Welch’s factory that he came across was teasing him in the way that he couldn’t have the liquids he needed, and the little boy advertised on the building was drinking his refreshed Welch’s juice, heightening his thirst. Not only did the cyclist get off track because of the directions, but the setting made his bike adventure to Yosemite even more unbearable, contributing significantly to his struggles.
595	6573	3	3	The setting effects the cyclist in many ways, first is that it is very hot in the desert, which can lead to dehydration and exhaustion. Second is that there aren’t many towns out there, making it difficult to resupply. Finally is that water is hard to find out there, so if he get thirsty it would be hard to get more water if you didn’t find a town, potentially leading to serious health consequences. These factors combine to make the desert a particularly challenging environment for cycling.
596	6575	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in almost everything he does and everything he faces. The setting is a hot day in June in the desert. There are many hills and the terrain changes a few times. Because the day is hot the cyclist drinks lots of water. And because he drinks lots of water he very soon runs out. In the story it states, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This quote shows that because it was so hot, the cyclist drank lots of water and because he drank lots of water he very quickly ran out of water. Also in the story it states, “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote suggests that because the terrain changed to hills, the cyclist became very tired and hot from having to pedal up and down those hills. And because this caused him to become hot and tired he also drank his water more quickly than if he was pedaling on a flat paved road in a cool day. This highlights how the challenging landscape exacerbates the effects of the heat. In conclusion the setting causes the cyclist to become tired, hot, and thirsty, which affects his entire journey.
597	6576	3	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist by describing that he is in a desert-like area in Lodi, California. They say it is very hot and there is sand everywhere. There also aren't many places to cool off at. They also described the water and Lodi to be about @NUM1 degrees in temperature. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite to get away from the heat and to have cool, shady pine trees to sit under, and cool fresh water. This affects the cyclist because he gets dehydrated because of the horrid heat, hindering his progress and making his journey much more difficult due to the harsh environment.
598	6577	3	3	The features of the setting have a large affect on the cyclist. If a cyclist would happen to be cycling in the snow, he or she could eat snow to keep from dehydration. If the cyclist, cycling in a hot environment, was cycling in winter time, he would not be so thirsty all of the time. Also if the whole ride was uphill, he would be so tired. Therefore, the environment plays a crucial role in the cyclist's experience.
599	6578	3	3	The conditions for the cyclist in the story ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî are pretty dangerous. ìa ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement balance my dehydrated state bottles contained only a few tantalizing sipsî (kurmaskie, @NUM1). There was a rather large snake in his path, coiled menacingly. You can tell he isnít an expert on snakes because he couldnít identify it, only registering its imposing size and the threat it posed. Because he is in the desert on a long bike ride, he is dehydrated; the relentless sun has taken its toll. His water supply is almost gone, leaving him with only a few sips, a discouraging situation given the distance he still has to cover. The cyclist feared many dangerous challenges in his journey, and the snake and his dehydration were quickly becoming serious problems.
600	6579	3	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the terrain, the lack of provisions and the power of self-determination. The terrain affected the cyclist by having he/she ride through rough paths in order to reach their destination; steep inclines, uneven surfaces and strong headwinds could all impede their progress. For example, if you walk on sharp rocks, you are bound to reach some rough spots where it seems you can’t walk. But that is where self-determination kicks in. The power to keep yourself moving even though there might be obstacles in your way; you know there will be a better path or a reward at the end. Another example of a feature is a lack of provision on your trip; without adequate food and water, the cyclist’s physical strength and mental focus would diminish. When you don’t have the right provision to keep yourself energised you can’t get over your obstacles or even push yourself to do anything. This interplay between external challenges and internal resolve demonstrates how significantly the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
601	6580	3	3	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the terrain has a negative effect on the author. He claims that “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie). This shows that he had been drinking his water too fast due to the heat from being in the desert at summertime. This rapid water consumption highlights the immediate physical demands the landscape imposes. After travelling for a long time with no water, he lets out a chuckle thinking of how he shouldn’t have taken the old men's advice. He explains that “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” This is an example of how badly the terrain had affected him. It's gotten to him so much that he applauds himself for having the energy to feel sorry for himself, demonstrating the psychological toll of the harsh environment. Ultimately, the terrain's impact is evident in both his physical struggles with dehydration and his mental state, reduced to finding solace in self-pity.
602	6581	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the cyclist is tired and thirsty already. The features include a desert like setting of California, it is extremely hot, there are no signs of civilization in sight, and the roads are like hills that always were throughout the desert. Adding to the challenge, the sun beats down mercilessly on the exposed skin, further draining his energy, and the endless expanse of barren land offers no visual relief or distraction from the physical strain. On top of those facts the cyclist is dehydrating because his water supply has diminished, compounding his fatigue and increasing the risk of heatstroke, thus making the situation incredibly dire.
603	6582	3	3	"The setting of the shortcut affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, he said there was rusty water, and ""it tasted like battery acid;"" because of this he was not able to drink it, which made him become dehydrated and weakened. Also, in the story it says, ""flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills."" This could have made the journey even harder for the cyclist because now he had to exert more effort to get up the hills. One more example is towards the end, he says, ""I began breaking my ride down into distances, I could see the horizon telling myself I could make it there."" By the cyclist saying this, it seems like he has given up hope and realizes that this arduous journey is going to be long and difficult. That is how the challenging setting in the story negatively affected the cyclist's physical and mental state."
604	6583	3	3	Some features of the setting affected the cyclist. The rolling hills, poisonous snake, and the conditions of the road worried her. For example, she said, ìI was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and the diary.î She had high doubt when saying that quote. She didn't think she would ever make it. Finally, she reached another destination and again finding herself asking another older man for directions! The cyclist's anxieties highlight the challenging and isolating nature of her journey.
605	6584	3	3	In ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by @PERSON1, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The first major example is when the cyclist finds that the flat road is turning into ìshort, rolling hills,î These hills are increasing the difficulty and are causing him doubt that he will make it. An additional part of the setting which caused major doubt was that he was in a deserted desert. ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.î This isolation amplified his feelings of vulnerability and exhaustion. The horizon was what kept cyclist going. ìI began breaking the ride down into distarres: I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, Iíd be fine.í The horizon kept him hopeful and determined. Without the setting he would not have been in such a serious predicament, but luckily in the end the setting helped him be determined enough to make it.
606	6585	3	3	I guess really safety comes first, and you have to be cautious when you are out in the streets on a bicycle. Visibility is key, so bright clothing and lights are important. I really don't understand much about bike safety, so I can't write much, but being aware of your surroundings seems crucial.
607	6586	3	3	When the biker listened to the old folks he had confidence. He biked to the first town but it was like a “ghost town.” A town is a town. Soon after that, he did not see anything. No cars, buildings, or anything. He was getting sad and dehydrated. The old men swore there was a town coming up so he put his trust and confidence in them once again. He saw a building coming up, but it was just an old wore down factory. He thought he was let down. He was sure he was going to die, right there right now. He then saw a sign for a fish camp! He was overjoyed! The place was real too! He thought of them as his savior! The settings effect the cyclist tremendously, as the desolation nearly broke him, but the hope of a town, and the reality of the fish camp, renewed his spirit and saved his life.
608	6587	3	3	In the story ìRough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie there were many settings that affect the cyclist. One example would be when he came up to a water pump and he tried to get water out but water didnít come out. ìÖworking the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance oozed outÖ.î (Kurmaskie). The useless pump emphasizes the desolation and lack of support for travelers in that area. Another example is when he came across rolling hills, and the scaring heat, he also came across a snake that took up most of the pavement. These challenging landscapes and wildlife encounters further highlight the difficult and unpredictable nature of his journey, making his accomplishment all the more impressive.
609	6588	3	3	The features of the settings affect the cyclist; if it is just between buildings and cars, the cyclist won't be able to break free and bicycle freely. So it can affect him, restricting movement and potentially creating a dangerous environment. The confined space limits maneuverability, increasing the risk of collisions and hindering the overall cycling experience. Ultimately, the setting directly impacts the cyclist's freedom and safety.
610	6589	3	3	The setting in the story was hot. The biker was sweating a lot. The whole town was empty. He pasted empty buildings. There were rivers and big hills that he had to ride through. As it says about the buildings, ìsomehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.î The setting would affect the cyclist because there was no one in the town, adding to a sense of isolation. Also, there were high hills, making the ride physically demanding. Therefore, the desolate environment and challenging terrain significantly impact the cyclist's journey and state of mind.
611	6590	3	3	The feature of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. He was in the California desert in the month of June. There was no water in sight, so he had to carefully ration the water he had. He says the sun began taking harder and harder jabs, and the terrain turned into short, unforgiving rolling hills. The hills made him work harder, which dehydrated him quicker, and since there was no water readily available in the desert, he realized he could have died of dehydration. His survival depended on managing his resources.
612	6591	3	3	When you're with your family in Ocean City biking down the boardwalk, your only obstacle is people. When you're in a race on windy roads, you could have lots of obstacles. The weather could be your greatest obstacle; you could pass out from lack of water and scorching heat, or you could fall over due to slippery roads from the rain. Along with that, nature could lay its toll upon you. Like when a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of @NUM1, Kurmaskie; like a snake, you don't know what you could come across. Ultimately, numerous unpredictable elements can turn a simple race into a true test of endurance and adaptability.
613	6592	3	3	"Many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is biking through deserts. ""A ridiculously large snake"" this quote shows that not only is weather and climate against him but also nature. ""I could drop from heat stroke"" another great quote showing how hot it really is where the cyclist is. ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind"" a great detailed description of where the cyclist is and how deserted the area is. ""The bottle only contained a few tantalising sips"" showing the cyclist is low on water in the desert, which could be a very bad thing. The above quotes really draw you in and you get to see the many harsh features of the setting and what it's like for the cyclist, emphasizing the isolation and struggle for survival in such a desolate environment."
614	6593	3	3	The features of the setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit affect the cyclist in many ways. First, in the essay when the author says he is in the deserts of California, that can affect because it gives them an idea of how hot it most likely was out there, and the dryness can lead to rapid dehydration. This lack of water can really harm someone. Also, when the author describes the water pumps and what comes out of them, it can give the cyclist a feeling of disgust and remind them to always keep a good water supply and to carefully consider the sources of hydration available. Therefore, the environmental details significantly shape the cyclist's experience and awareness.
615	6594	3	3	"Many things in the setting of the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî affected the cyclist throughout his journey. One very important part that affected the cyclist greatly is the fact that he was in a desert without a good supply of water. This arid landscape meant constant thirst and the risk of dehydration, pushing him to ration carefully and search desperately for any source of replenishment. Another part of the setting that challenged the cyclist was the length of his journey. The sheer distance to Yosemite demanded physical endurance and mental fortitude, forcing him to confront his limits day after day. Those two factors of his journey to Yosemite combined are probably the worst and most challenging things that affected the cyclist; the lack of water in a long journey compounded his difficulties, making the trip exceptionally arduous and testing his resolve to the utmost degree."
616	6595	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist because it was a lack of water and he was in the high deserts of California. For example, the text stated, ""when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid."" That showed clearly when he tried to get water from a pump what came out was undrinkable, thus emphasizing the scarcity of potable water. As the setting was extremely hot, it further contributed to the cyclist's misery by increasing his dehydration and discomfort, ultimately making his journey significantly more challenging."
617	6596	3	3	In the story the features of setting affect the cyclist because there is not much he can depend on. For example, it is the desert and usually there is nothing there, no shade, no water, just relentless sun. The cyclist only has a limited supply of what he needs and riding through there does not help him replenish anything. For example, the old men who gave him directions made him think he could make it longer before he could elgo, but their directions were misleading. This affected him because throughout his journey his lack of water slowed him down and made him think he wasn't going to make it, creating a sense of desperation. When he finally got to ìGary & Wilberís fish camp,î exhausted and humbled, he learned a lesson about relying on others' advice in unfamiliar terrain because when an old man asked if he know the quickest route to Yosemite he said yes, I have a very good map,'' suggesting he'd learned to trust his own resources and preparation.
618	6597	3	3	In many real-life situations, nature or a setting can be the biggest hindrance in succeeding, or even surviving. For example, the cyclist withstood the blazing heat of the sun as he pedaled through what seemed to be the desert's living room: Dry, desolate, and extremely scornful. ìWide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.î This quote highlights and depicts the intense heats of the desert. Another feature in the setting was the ever-hanging hills and steps; though pedaling down the hills was an easier task, traveling up the hill, as well as maneuvering the twists and bends, served as a direct conflict. An example, ìwith what I believed was my last burst of energy I maneuvered a setting affect a situation is ultimately, the cyclist reached his destination is great relief. But the biggest hindrance was along his setting. Ultimately, the cyclist's arduous journey demonstrates how significantly a challenging environment can impede progress and test one's limits, underscoring the setting's role as the primary obstacle.
619	6598	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because they made the simplest challenges difficult for him. The lack of water and the snake in his path are examples of how the environment complicated his journey. These seemingly small obstacles significantly impacted his progress, demonstrating the power of the setting to influence even the most determined traveler.
620	6599	3	3	"First, by accepting the old men's advice, the cyclist was setting himself up for some hardships that he would easily have avoided by using his map. He first encounters a ""ghost town,"" lifeless and most importantly, waterless. Then, he encounters a pump that gives out water tasting like ""battery acid."" Next he rides past a ""Rough Road Ahead"" sign; not the most encouraging thing on his journey. To add to the despair, he has to maneuver his way past a tempting yet empty juice factory, its colorful signs a cruel taunt to his thirst. Finally, the parched cyclist arrives at ""Gary and Wilber's Fish Camp."" To him, this simple bait shop was like a beacon of hope for food and, crucially, hydration, highlighting the dire consequences of ignoring reliable guidance."
621	6600	3	3	In this story, the cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite, California. In the beginning, the cyclist was sure of himself; he decided to ask some old men that looked like they hadn't been off their porch since Carter was in office for directions. The old men, with mischievous grins, pointed him down a dusty, unmarked road, ultimately leading him into the middle of the desert. In the desert, the sun was beating down on him, and he had a limited supply of water in his bottle. There was no sign of civilization whatsoever; only endless sand and shimmering heat waves. These hot conditions made the cyclist very hot, tired, and very thirsty, his throat parched and his muscles aching. But that didn't stop him; he kept going, pedaling onward with grim determination, and eventually, he came upon a little town where he could drink cool water and take a well-needed rest, finally escaping the desert's harsh embrace.
622	6601	3	3	Through most the story, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a more negative way. For instance, he makes it to this town a guy swore was there, but it turned out to be abandoned. So he let out a sad, hopeless laugh and still had energy to feel sorry for himself. Another feature was the Grape Juice Factory, also abandoned, so he hung his head and that blues tune ìsummer timeî rattled in his brain. A third feature was his thirst. So he stuck some pebbles in his mouth to take his mind off it. Then he thought about how lucky heíd be if he checked, @CAPS1 negative to me. Therefore, the cyclist's journey is fraught with hardship, amplifying his sense of despair.
623	6602	3	3	The features from the essay affect the cyclist in many ways because he is getting fatigued, and is drinking more and more water. The roads are getting rough, so he needs to slow down for safety. If he slows down, he will get tired and need more water, although he is all out; on top of that, the old men really didn't know what they were talking about. Therefore, the geographical features significantly affect the cyclist.
624	6603	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways; for example, the heat was unbearable, beating down on him during this long ride. The fact that he had nowhere around him to fill up his water bottle only worsened the situation. So he was dying of thirst, and he didn’t know where he was going or how far he had to go, adding to his distress. The desolate setting was crucial in this story, amplifying his struggle and despair.
625	6604	3	3	The setting in the beginning of the story is flat and easy, but as the path becomes unfamiliar, it turns into many hills and turns. This affects the cyclist a lot because he was low on water and was beginning to become dehydrated, making each uphill climb a monumental struggle and the winding paths disorienting. Therefore, the changing terrain significantly exacerbates the cyclist's already precarious situation.
626	6605	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist. He starts to see things that will affect his mind. Passing fields are rolling around him; he starts to feel abandoned and misled because there are no signs indicating he is going the right way. This disorientation, coupled with the vast emptiness, begins to play tricks on his perception. Ultimately, the environment and lack of guidance contribute to a growing sense of psychological unease.
627	6606	3	3	The cyclist has to over come a lot of obstacles. For example, there is a snake in his path, so he cationly rides around it. Also, there are alot of hills and he wasnít sure if he could make it up those hills, but he pedaled with determination. Furthermore, he is almost out of water so he could die of heatstroke or dehidration, making each sip precious. In conclusion he over comes these obsticles and achieves his goal, proving his resilience.
628	6607	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” the author goes through many sceneries. All of the places that the author goes to make him even more determined because he wants to find water and he just wants to get to Yosemite. The relentless sun beats down and the landscape offers no respite, yet the desire to reach his destination fuels him. The determination pushes him to keep going further and further. And then the determination finally pays off after he goes around a turn because he then sees a place where he can get something to drink and a place to cool down. This discovery validates his perseverance, showing that even the most arduous journeys can lead to rewarding outcomes.
629	6608	3	3	The features of this setting effect the author while he is cycling. They changed his hope to doubt. The complete absence of buildings or cars, stretching mile after mile of empty road, led him to believe he would never get to Yosemite. Also, it had a rough, uneven terrain that made him doubt that he would ever get water, imagining his water bottle empty and no streams in sight. Im sure if the setting had buildings, people, even just civilization to offer some sign of progress and potential respite, then the cyclist would of been fine, his hope sustained by the promise of reaching his destination.
630	6609	3	3	Blazing tempitures, lack of water, dwinding hope-all are the parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. Blazing tempitures, because the hotter the weather was, the more perspiration and lack of hydration was apparent; you can’t put anything back in your skin, and your body canít function without water. Finally, dwinding hope: the cyclist didnít think he was going to live through this ordeal. He tried hard and pushed himself, and success was made. He lived, overcoming the harsh environment and his own fears.
631	6610	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he gets tiring. The character in the story is riding his bike for a long period of time and he gets tired. He rides alone with nothing or no one around him except the trees and wild animals, and the long stretches of road contribute to his fatigue.
632	6611	3	3	The features of the cyclist's journey are rough because of the hills, snakes, heat, and limited water. The hills offer a refreshing breeze on the descent, but the uphill climbs are grueling. Snakes pose a threat with their potentially harmful bites. The intense heat can lead to illness. Insufficient water can severely impact the cyclist, causing dehydration. All these elements combine to make the journey challenging.
633	6612	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways. The features of the setting affect the cyclist through the posted speed. Due to how the setting is, the cyclist has a rough hill with which to contend. The rough hill affects the cyclist by demanding more physical exertion. Ultimately, the setting dictates the cyclist's experience.
634	6613	3	3	The hills and bumpy road slow him down, and he is dehydrated. That is also slowing him down because he needs water to replenish his strength. There are obsticles in the road too, such as, the big snake laying across the middle of the road, basking in the sun. He is lost without water and could possibly die of heatstroke if he doesn't find some relief soon.
635	6614	3	3	Knew what he was getting himself into, so if he needed water or anything like that, it was probably his own fault; he should have brought some with him. He understood the risks and requirements of the situation.
636	6615	3	3	The cyclist and his journey in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit were impacted by the setting. The deserts of California in June caused him to be weary very easily due to the scorching sun and lack of shade. The terrain change from the flat road to hills made him feel less confident because he felt the road sign was taunting him by saying DO NOT Exceed 55 mph, when that was clearly impossible on an incline. He could only go @NUM1. Finally, the large snake created an obstacle for him by blocking the majority of pavement in front of the cyclist, forcing him to carefully maneuver around it. All of these features affected the cyclist in some way, illustrating how the environment played a crucial role in shaping his experience.
637	6616	3	3	The story is basically talking about how more people with cars should ride bicycles to work or to school so there won't be as much pollution in the air. Encouraging cycling could lead to cleaner air in our cities. Making the switch, even a few days a week, could significantly reduce harmful emissions. Therefore, opting for bicycles contributes to a healthier environment for everyone.
638	6617	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The temperature in the area affects the way he drinks his water, leading him to think he is going to die because he is running out of water in the scorching heat. The ""towns"" he comes to are so deserted he thinks he is going in the wrong direction, with no signs of life to reassure him. All the settings in the story also help him not to give up but keep on going, pushing him to overcome the harsh landscape. In conclusion, even though he had to go through all that doubt that he was going to be alive in the end, he still went on and tried. In the end he did make it, and all it was worth it, proving his resilience against the odds."
639	6618	3	3	There are many settings that affect the cyclist. One feature would be the challenging terrain around him, with its steep inclines and rough surfaces. Also, the unexpected obstacles faced by the cyclist, such as fallen branches or potholes, would impede his progress. Another feature would be the presence of wild animals, perhaps aggressive dogs or snakes, and the scarceness of water around him, creating thirst and potential dehydration. Also, the old man who gave him unimportant and non-updated information regarding the safest routes or available resources, further complicating his journey. All of these would affect the cyclist because it would place immense wear and fear on his physical and mental strengths, ultimately testing his endurance and resolve.
640	6619	3	3	I think that there were many things contributing to the cyclist's state at the end of the story. First, there was the fact of time. He was cycling in June which is very hot due to it being summer. Second, he was cycling through California which is warm even in early spring. And third, he was traveling through the deserts. So if you put all of that together, he was cycling on a hot June day in the deserts of California. These elements all contributed to the character's state. He went through dead towns in his search for water and found an old well pump with extremely hot water that tasted like battery acid. He drank too much water at the beginning, which left him with just spit toward the end. He was lucky to find a fish camp in the middle of nowhere and to have found water, even though the desperation prompted him to overindulge initially, ultimately nearly depleting his reserves. The combination of heat, thirst, and poor water management culminated in the cyclist's weakened condition.
641	6620	3	3	"The features affect the setting of the cyclist because in some ways they throw you off a little with subtle shifts in the narrative and then you will get confused about what they are actually talking about. The littlest thing that could throw you off is a line, for example, when it says ""before the last world war."" That kind of detail threw me off a little, disrupting the flow and potentially obscuring the primary focus of the setting description."
642	6621	3	3	The setting that was affecting the cyclist was the lack of water he had because it says “the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,” and the text also says “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing the spit to circulate.” He wouldn’t be trying to get his mind off of thirst if he wasn’t thirsty, indicating a harsh and arid environment where hydration was a significant challenge, ultimately impacting his physical and mental endurance.
643	6622	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because it was June and the cyclist had little water. The scorching sun beat down, intensifying the cyclist's thirst. The cyclist was dehydrated and couldn't find any building or water for many miles. The relentless heat combined with the barren landscape made the journey incredibly difficult. The cyclist took advice from oldtimers which didn't know what they were talking about. Their inaccurate directions led the cyclist further astray, exacerbating the situation. In conclusion, the weather and the location affected the cyclist, creating a challenging and potentially dangerous situation.
644	6623	3	3	The cyclist pedaled through all types of different terrain. Through hills, high desert, flat roads and the woods. This cyclist took the advice of bunch old men who thought they knew a short cut to the Yosemite national park. This short cut turned out to be a nightmare. The cyclist had only brought so many water bottles and was quickly drinking them all. The setting of this story changed a lot making the cyclist at times have to pedal faster and slowes. The cyclist was quickly worn out and started to loose hope in himself. The terrain kept changing making it hard for him not to be thirsty. Eventually he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or a heat stroke. As he came up over a long hill he saw a bait store and stopped inside to have a drink vowed not to listen to a bunch of old guys again. The icy water revived him, and he purchased a few more bottles before continuing his journey, a little wiser and more self-reliant, having learned a valuable lesson about trusting his own instincts over dubious shortcuts.
645	6624	3	3	...what I shouldn’t have done was let them have a peck at my map. The eagerness stemming from the promise of a quicker journey blinded me. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride. This was despite my general rule to never take directions from old timers, a lesson learned through past misadventures, and a decision I immediately regretted.
646	6625	3	3	During the cyclist journey to Yosemite many things got in his way and slowed him down. For example, he listened to the old men who gave him wrong directions, sending him down dusty, unpaved roads instead of the smooth highway, which added considerable time to his trip. Also, his water supply was getting low, causing dehydration which drained his energy a lot quicker than usual, making each pedal stroke feel heavier. The heat also played a part of his energy loss. The heat made him sweat profusely, and without sufficient water to replenish it, the water that was in his body became of no use, contributing to muscle cramps and fatigue, ultimately hindering his progress significantly.
647	6626	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, he was in the California desert in June. The heat and lack of water can cause people to become dehydrated, pass out, or even die. There are not many sources of water in the deserts, making survival difficult. The terrain didn’t help him much either; hills use a lot of energy and made him perspire, causing him to lose fluid from his body. The cyclist was greatly affected by the features of the setting, as the harsh environment presented significant challenges to his health and well-being.
648	6627	3	3	The rider in the story ìRough Road Aheadî by Joe Kurmaskie has a very analyzing mind, which is affected by things around him. At first, the rider ìrode into the morning...with a smileî because of the bright sun, and the ìcool pinesî and rushing riversî. He is very confident with the old mens directions; this first sign of disappointment is when he comes to the ìramshackle shed...î And the ì...sight of this was troubling...î to him, but he rode on. The rider’s optimism begins to wane as doubt creeps in. He thinks as he rides over the ìcrippling hillsî that maybe this wasnít such a great idea, questioning the wisdom of his chosen path. Finally he comes to a old bait shop, and the ìmodern bathroomî that he enters to drink from, gives him relief from the desert he had just been riding through; this small luxury offers a temporary respite from the harsh realities of his journey, reaffirming the challenges that are affecting his perspective. This emphasizes how the rider's mental state is vulnerable to the conditions he is in.
649	6628	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. The rocky, uneven landscape was hard to ride on, and the intense heat combined with little available water made hydration a constant struggle. As a result, it was a long trip, and he had a difficult time reaching his destination, arriving exhausted and dehydrated.
650	6629	3	3	At first the trip was easy going and flat. It was a nice day out and the water supply was draining faster than expected. Soon, the path became hills and soon got rough with loose gravel. Even though the pines gave shade it wasn’t enough to help the cyclist battling the heat. Eventually he reached somewhat civilization after enduring a grueling climb and bicycle trip through the woods, signaling the end of his challenging ride.
651	6630	3	3	"""Rough Road Ahead"" highlights the critical dangers stemming from excessive speed and aggressive behavior, urging vigilance and adherence to rules. The essay emphasizes the importance of obeying instructions and paying close attention to road signs. You should always keep close @NUM1/= out for signs and things, because being mindful of them and understanding their messages are crucial for safe navigation. This attentiveness allows drivers to anticipate potential hazards and react appropriately, contributing to a safer driving environment for everyone and ultimately preventing accidents."
652	6631	3	3	The cyclist's experience was significantly shaped by environmental factors such as water temperature, rolling hills, and the variable condition of the roads. Hydration was key for the cyclist, and water temperature played a crucial role. Upon depleting his supply, he found a shed with pumps. Unfortunately, the water was hot, and despite his efforts to cool it, it remained warm, forcing him to drink it as is. Rolling hills presented another layer of hardship; the initially flat terrain gradually transitioned into inclines, straining his leg muscles and making continued riding more difficult. Finally, the road condition posed a challenge. The smooth start gave way to a rough and rocky surface, impacting his speed and comfort. These environmental elements collectively increased the difficulty of the cyclist's journey, testing his endurance and resolve.
653	6632	3	3	Setting depends on how you can go or move. The town hills helped the cyclist. The up hills didn't. The cyclist got a bad idea or attitude when he saw the towns; he was upset and mad. He didn’t want to die, and yet he thought he was going to. He said he wouldn’t trust old men anymore because they didn’t know what they were talking about. How and why did he trust them in the first place? Perhaps he asked for directions, relying on their supposed local knowledge, only to find himself facing treacherous terrain that made him feel his life was in danger, leading to his frustration and vow to distrust them from now on.
654	6633	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, ""I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This quote shows that his surroundings were giving him difficulty and a challenge for his travel. By describing the hills as ""rolling"" it helps the reader imagine the obstacles he was going through. Also, the sign that read, ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger. This also warns the cyclist to be cautious. Lastly an example of the setting that helps shows the character's hardships is, ""no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind."" If anything were to happen to the character, as the author was foreshadowing, he'd be stranded and all alone. He'd be in trouble and there would be no one to help him. If the author did not use these examples, the reader would not easily get a picture of the troubles he had to overcome. In conclusion these examples added emphasis and meaning to the text, creating a vivid and suspenseful atmosphere."
655	6634	3	3	Well the features of the setting affects the cyclist is a lot of ways. Well when his water was too hot to drink, he got some pebbles and stuck them in his mouth. He had heard somewhere that if you do that it will dilute your spit, hopefully cooling him down. The terrain of the story was very rocky and hilly, making the cycling much more difficult. Those are the features of the terrain affecting his ride.
656	6635	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The hills affected the cyclist because they would be harder for him to ride up, requiring more energy and slowing his pace. The abandoned town also affected him. When he got to the town he was hoping he could get more water and take a break, finding some respite, but when he got there the town was abandoned and offered no such relief. Also, the highway was hard for him because it would be hard to ride on, with the rough asphalt and constant traffic adding to his struggle. Also, there was nowhere that he could get water around him, compounding his dehydration and fatigue. Many features of the setting affected him, creating a challenging and unforgiving environment for his journey.
657	6636	3	3	The features of the setting gradually contribute to the cyclist’s anger. For example, at the beginning of the story, the cyclist comes across poisonous snakes, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule.” All of these sights trouble the narrator, and he starts to become frightened and neurotic. As he cycles on, the narrator begins to deplete his water supply, and when he stops to restock, “the water wouldn’t cool down” and “it had the flavor of battery acid.” The cyclist’s lack of water frustrates him, and the increasing steepness of the hills adds to his annoyance. The final straw came when the cyclist passed by what he thought “had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory.” This ruined factory suggests a broken promise of refreshment. The narrator goes on in an outrage to explain that he hopes to die out on the road, in order to spare himself from the dreaded features of the setting. Thus, the oppressive environment, from the wildlife to the lack of resources, pushes the cyclist to a point of despair.
658	6637	3	3	The features in the setting most definetly affect the cyclist while he travels. The cyclist is incredibly thirsty and tired and the setting heís placed in just gives him no hope of survival really. He first comes to a ìghost townî where he finds no one is living. This first encounter with isolation in a desolute place doesnít really affect him because it is the first place he finds but the rest of the storys setting comes to mimic this. As he travels he is met with barren land, no water and no people in sight, just the scorching sun beating down. Itís June in California and the cyclist fears he will soon suffer from heat stroke if he doesnít find water yet. It doesnít help when he comes to an abandoned juice factory that taunts him with the one thing he needs to survive, amplifying his desperation. All in all the features in the setting make the cyclist lose hope, and make him feel like he will die if he dosenít find water soon.
659	6638	3	3	The setting in the story ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî was based in the hot, and dry terrain of California. This setting affected the character mood, influencing their emotions and reactions. This is because some of its included features can seem as actual metaphorically based moods. An example from the story is, ìThe cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite...î this quote from the story could suggest the tone and the mood of the scenery which would be calm, and relaxed, creating a sense of tranquility that could affect the characters. So from the scene that is being seen and the mood it has would also give the character its mood, impacting their overall experience.
660	6639	3	3	The features of the setting that affect a cyclist depends where they are located. In this story, the feeling of nothingness, the encompassing desert, and the oppressive heat gave him no hope. It all depends on where you are cycling. “It didn’t really matter I was going to die,” this quote encapsulates his feelings as he was dying of thirst. He felt nothing and was certain of his impending death, until he found a sign of civilization nearby; this discovery revived him and his hope was raised. Ultimately, the environment played a critical role in both his despair and his eventual recovery.
661	6640	3	3	I think the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being a long, hot, lonely ride there, had an effect on him. The oppressive heat and isolation certainly played a role in his mental state. It scared him, which made him go longer. Fear spurred him onward, even when his body protested. He had nothing to drink and, thinking he was going to die, it made him weak. Dehydration sapped his strength and resolve. The snake in the way caused him delay, and every stop he made along the way affected him, impacting his time and energy. All of these elements combined to create a challenging and transformative experience for the cyclist.
662	6641	3	3	I would think even riding a bike for so long can be bad for the behind, causing discomfort. But it's also good exercising, especially for the legs, all the strength you get from the muscle. To know where you're going could take forever if you're on a very long journey. But I do know what they would have to face: all types of weather, and as long as you have the right gear on, no harm *should* come to you, allowing you to complete the ride comfortably.
663	6642	3	3	"At first he was mad because he took advice from old men who never left their porch. He regretted listening to their tall tales about shortcuts. He got scared he was going to die because he had drunk all his water, and he didn’t know how long it would be till he got some more. He shouldn’t have drunk his water so quickly knowing he had a while to go on the trail. Then he became happy when he saw the ""Bait & Tackle"" sign. He biked quickly down the hill, eager for a cold drink and a less-traveled path."
664	6643	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit in many ways. The cyclist is affected because the setting is depressing and frightening. When the cyclist first sees the speed limit sign of 55 mph, he says, ìSometimes life can be so cruelî because he can only go 12 mph considering he's on a bike, highlighting the disparity between his reality and the expectations of the road. After seeing the sign, a snake crosses his path, startling him. He’s frightened by it because it looked like a diamond back, and he was trying to keep his balance and ease past it, adding to his anxiety and physical strain. Since the main problem the cyclist is faced with is the lack of water, the dry, long hills seem to make him more weak and tired. Tumble weeds crossed past him, and there was no water in sight. The harshness of the landscape directly contributes to his dehydration and exhaustion. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, shaping his experience and intensifying his struggle.
665	6644	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. It made him become dehydrated. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 sentence @NUM2 he stated ìI eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.î This shows how the heat and climate of the setting affected him by how he was getting thrown off balance and wears to him getting dehydrated. The demanding environment clearly took a toll. The setting of the story ìDo not exceed posted speed limit,î by Joe Kurmaskie, effects the cyclist in the story. Therefore, the harsh conditions of the setting directly contributed to the cyclist's physical struggles.
666	6645	3	3	The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist. It is an extremely hot day in California, hindering his ride. This causes him to become dehydrated much faster while he is on a “short hit” leading to nowhere. “Wide signs of dried outcast winded my limb, and the growing realization that I could drop from… a gorgeous day in June” This quote shows how deceptive that calm day really was, and the fact the cyclist is sweating so much shows how much the weather is affecting him physically. The rolling hills in the story also affect the cyclist. By cycling upwards and downwards so often, it elongated his journey. It slowed him down even longer in getting to a town with water. The deserted roads in the setting also negatively affected the narrator. It gave him a hopeless feeling because there was no place to stop, further depleting his water supply, ultimately emphasizing how the harsh environment drastically impacts the cyclist's well-being and progress.
667	6646	3	3	Joe Kurmaskie had a rough time trying to get to Yosemite National park. First, he received directions from an old man, Joe followed these instructions; little did he know that he would be headed for many hardships. After he reached the first town he checked his supply. About @NUM1 more miles he realized his bottle was getting low because he was travelling through the high deserts of California, a place where it is hot. Out there, the terrain changed, and he no longer had that much water. He ran into a snake, which he swore was a diamond back. Finally, he came to another town, got some water and then left after going through ghost towns. Riding in conditions that are hot and unfamiliar are hard to do. Adding hills to heat is not a good combination, with nothing around it can be very dangerous, even fatal. Before you bike think of what conditions are ahead of you, so you can be well prepared.
668	6647	3	3	because he was telling to make it write he needed to go, and he rushed it because he was driving to soil and because he was driving 55 mph per hour and 12 mph, and sometimes life can feel so cruel. In life, ya dig? And that is all I can say right now. These circumstances created a perfect storm of pressure, impacting his ability to focus.
669	6648	3	3	"Each time the author comes to a point where the setting isn't very appealing or helpful, he loses hope for reaching his destination or finding a nice place to rest and get some fresh water. For example, the text states, ""one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The author has a sort of negative, sarcastic tone at this point, indicative of his growing weariness. This shows that he’s getting frustrated and losing some hope. He also mentions that the ""sight was troubling,"" which underscores how significantly the surrounding features or scenery can impact his morale and expectations, further hindering his progress."
670	6649	3	3	Lots of features in the setting play an affect on cyclist. Some that in @MONTH1 play an affect are the heat, flat road that’s hard to ride on, or how there is increased wind resistance. The combined effect of these elements can significantly impact a cyclist's performance, making races or even casual rides more challenging.
671	6650	3	3	This American tale expresses how hard it is to do something, but to do it through determination. The cyclist faced many changes, not only physically but also mentally. There was no one in sight, not a building or anything. As this rider came to think about the substantial beating he took from the ride, he is tired and with no sight of anything, he began to question if he might not be able to do it, but his determination pushed him to keep going.
672	6651	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. First of all he is travelling through a desert in California in June so the weather is extremely hot, reaching scorching temperatures, and the cyclist needs water. However, as he is running out of the water he brought along with himself, he cannot find any other water himself so he is thirsty and almost dehydrated, his lips cracked and his head throbbing. It frustrates him that when he finds water, not only is it hot but it tastes like battery acid, a metallic tang clinging to his tongue. When the cyclist decides to conserve some of his water and go to the next town to get more water, there is another setback. The condition of the road is so poor, riddled with potholes and loose gravel, that the cyclist cannot go more that 12 mph. Thus, if he ever reaches the next town, he still will have to wait longer for the much needed water, travelling at 12 mph under the relentless sun. The snake, a sidewinder slithering across his path, is also another setback that the cyclist was fortunately able to escape, swerving just in time. Thus his major concern is the lack of water, a constant, gnawing anxiety that overshadows everything else.
673	6652	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. At first, it was a bright, shiny day, the sun glinting off his bike, and the cyclist was happy, feeling the wind on his face. He reaches the first town, which is a ghost town, with empty buildings and silent streets, and it makes him sad, a sense of loneliness washing over him. Riding on, he begins to lose water, his throat growing parched. The once bright, shiny day began to beat the heat down on the cyclist, the sun's rays now oppressive. He reached a ramshackle shed, offering little shade, and began to lose hope, feeling the exhaustion set in. He loses water quickly and becomes more dehydrated, his muscles starting to ache. The terrain becomes slopes and hills, testing his endurance, and the ride becomes harder, each push of the pedal a struggle, when he reached the grape drink factory his hopes were almost gone, the sweet, artificial scent a cruel reminder of his thirst. But just over the hill was a fishing shop, a beacon in the desolate landscape. He used his remaining energy to speed down the hill, the promise of water fueling him, to get water and get his energy back, the setting ultimately offering a chance at survival.
674	6653	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when it says, ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,"" the features of this setting are making the cyclist determined to explore and conquer the landscape. Another example is when it says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake – it really did look like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me,"" the challenging features of the setting are making him brave and courageous as he faces unexpected obstacles. The last example is when it says, ""I hung my head,"" implying a difficult or disheartening environment. The features of this setting are making the cyclist have despair, perhaps due to exhaustion or setbacks encountered along the way. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist's emotions and resolve throughout the journey."
675	6654	3	3	In the essay “Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist is affected both positively and negatively by the setting. Setting is the surrounding in which the story takes place. In the story, a cyclist loses his way and is put in danger because of it. The setting of the story can be described as mountainous with many rolling hills. The author describes the setting by saying, “two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.” The change in terrain made it more difficult for the cyclist. However, he also used the land to give him hope that he was almost there. He told himself that he’d make it if he made it over the next hill. The setting of the story gave the cyclist both hope and problems in his journey to survive.
676	6655	3	3	The cyclist was affected by the fact that he took advice from some old men whose information was not accurate. Then he cycled along the desert which was very hot, the sun beating down mercilessly. He had a limited supply of water and that also affected him in a very bad way, each sip carefully rationed. He almost had a heat stroke a few times, his vision blurring and head pounding. He was probably angry that he took these men’s advice and got himself into this predicament. Then when he finally found the fish camp, he was overjoyed with relief, a wave of gratitude washing over him. But at the same time, if he had asked someone else for directions, he would not have been in this situation in the first place. So it’s really confusing because he probably felt relieved and mad at the same time, a mix of emotions swirling within him. And then the other old man asked him did he know the best way there. He was right to say yes because if he didn’t, the old man would have gave him some more messed up direction and he would have been out there again, about to have another heat stroke, thus making his agreement a necessary act of self-preservation.
677	6656	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by rush he /she got when speeding down the hill. The fresh morning air fills their lungs, no limits just you and your feet pushing the pedals. Speeding, going as fast as you can with your heart pounding in your chest and the wind whipping past. No boundarys, when you can go where you like, when you like, exploring hidden paths. No people to get in the way of you and your need for speed, just the open road and the thrill of the ride. This freedom and exhilaration are deeply connected to the setting.
678	6657	3	3	"In the short story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting profoundly affects the cyclist's journey, both mentally and physically. Unaware of his exact location, the cyclist's experience is shaped by the environments he encounters. The old towns and desolate desert landscapes he passes through begin to take a toll, leading him to remark, ""The sight was troubling."" As he continues toward California in the June heat, the arduous journey intensifies its grip on him. The heat and lack of resources contribute to his growing despair. For example, he says, ""I got down my hands and knew working the hands of the rusted water pump with all my strength."" This illustrates his weakening state and desperation for water in the barren landscape. Despite his initial determination, the unforgiving setting gradually chips away at his hope, contributing to his growing sense of self-pity. Ultimately, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's internal and external struggles throughout his journey."
679	6658	3	3	Directions from well-meaning but misguided older people in June, and a lack of water all impacted the rider on his journey. The older people's promised shortcut proved incorrect, leading him astray. It was June in California, so the heat would have been intense and draining. He had already consumed most of his water. Without finding another water source, he faced a life-threatening situation. These factors significantly influenced the rider's experience and well-being on his trip.
680	6659	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The features in the story changed the speaker’s mood throughout his journey. For example, in the beginning, he came across a deserted town, adding to his sense of isolation, so he was cautious. Next, he came across a fork in the road, symbolizing uncertainty, which was troubling to him. Then he passed a snake, heightening his anxiety, and had the obstacles of the hills, testing his endurance, which made him become determined. Finally, his determination changed to relief when he reached Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, a sign of civilization and the end of his arduous ride. In conclusion, the setting in the story greatly affects the cyclist by changing his moods and attitude towards his journey, shaping his experience from apprehension to eventual relief.
681	6660	3	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed Limit,” is about a man that follows some bad directions and in the middle of a desert is stuck without water. He starts to lack confidence in the directions when the setting changes. He said, “After fourty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first town it fit the traditional definition of ghost town.” He had been told this was a thriving town but was left with nothing. This was a big let down and the cyclist wasn’t so positive this had been the right choice. He keeps on riding and finds another dissetling sight. “One ramshacle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that wouldn’t hold in the lamest of mule greeted me.” @CAPS1 was another place said to be good but all he got was battery flavored water, a taste that did nothing to quench his thirst. On the last strech of his bike met with rough rolling hills, a diamondback looking snake slithering across his path, and an abandoned juice factory that offered no refreshment. All of this brang his spirits lower and lower until he thought he would die out there, alone and dehydrated. The cyclist ended up finding a store, a beacon of hope in the desolate landscape, but he was discauraged by the environment he was in, a hot and could have died if he had not found it. The journey, fraught with disappointment and the constant threat of dehydration, left him shaken, a stark reminder of the perils of blindly trusting directions in the face of a harsh environment.
682	6661	3	3	In the essay, the cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting. Under the conditions he could barely survive and make it to his destination. The relentless heat and barren landscape are clearly taking their toll. It is clear that the features of the setting are affecting him when he states, “The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cruel.” In his efforts he is slowly getting weaker, and the sign he sees only makes him feel worse because it seems to him that it mocking him with unattainable speed. He also states, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and ledge one in my throat.” This shows he is ready to give up completely and wouldn’t care if he died, highlighting the despair the environment has instilled. From the author’s tone, it is clear that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist, pushing him to the brink of physical and mental collapse.
683	6662	3	3	Features of the setting such as the hot sun, no water, and ìGary and Wilberís Fish Camp,î greatly affected the cyclist. Since the cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June, the temperature was really high and the hot sun left ìwide rings of dried sweatî on his shirt and made the cyclist realize that he could drop from a heatstroke. The relentless heat bore down on him, making each pedal stroke a monumental effort. Also, the fact that the only water around felt ìsomewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degreesî and ìhad the flavor of battery acidî prevented the cyclist from drinking it and put him in a ìdehydrated state.î This lack of potable water further exacerbated his already precarious situation in the harsh environment. ìGary and Wilberís Fish Campî affected the cyclist by solving his problem of dehydration, since there was cold water available for him upon arrival. Therefore, the environmental conditions of the desert significantly challenged the cyclist, while the Fish Camp ultimately provided much-needed relief.
684	6663	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First of all, if the cyclist hadn’t listened to the old man's directions, he would have never gone through this trouble in the unfamiliar terrain. Also, being that he didn’t have enough water when he went on riding through the desert landscape, caused him to be real dehydrated under the scorching sun. He should of turned back as soon as he ran out of water instead of pushing forward. Plus the heat made him real hot and thirsty in the desolate environment. He should know how to never trust any strangers offering advice and try things on his own, especially when venturing into unknown territories.
685	6664	3	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist. The setting makes him feel thirsty, dry, hot, and lost. In the story the setting plays a big party in the cyclist's will to ride to the next town. First the cyclist asks directions from a guy that never left his house in decades this creates, doubt because the directions may be outdated. Also in the story it says “Tumbleweeds cross my path” this makes the cyclists feel lost, emphasizing his isolation. Finally it say the “water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This makes the cyclist thirsty and tired, diminishing his resolve. The features definatly have an effect on the cyclists.
686	6665	3	3	In the story ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î the cyclist is affected by the setting in many different ways. He was biking in the middle of the summer in the very hot state of California, with the sun beating down relentlessly. This affects him because he is sweating profusely and he is running out of water quickly, meaning he could possibly become dehydrated if he doesn't find a way to replenish his fluids. The roads are very hilly, with steep inclines that challenge him, so he has to use a lot more energy to get up the hills, draining his strength. That’s why I think the cyclist is extremely affected by the setting in the story ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed.î
687	6666	3	3	The cyclist had to deal with some tough terrain throughout his ride. First, he was in the ìhigh deserts of California in June.î That usually brings a picture to my mind of a very dry, hot place. The cyclist had trouble finding water he needed, and thought he might die of heatstroke in the conditions. Also, there were hills. The cyclist said he had to ride over ìone long, crippling hill.î From my experiences as a cyclist, hills are the worst part, especially if youíre thirsty. The climate in this story was very hot and dry, and the terrain was full of hills, so altogether, that would make one bad bike ride. Experiencing both dehydration and difficult climbs would certainly test anyone's physical and mental endurance.
688	6667	3	3	Snake, heat, hills-all are what the biker had to deal with because of certain settings. He had to deal with a diamond back rattlesnake crossing his path, startling him. He was going through the desert so it was like 110 degrees. While he was biking he had to go up crippling hills that seemed to stretch on forever. He had a redicuious setting to have to bike with. I would never be able to do what he did, facing those conditions and challenges on two wheels.
689	6668	3	3	The cyclist had alot of problems with his setting. It was very hot, the sun beating down relentlessly, and he started getting low on water. This caused him to become dehydrated, his energy rapidly depleting. There was hardly any civilization, just miles of desolate landscape, so no one could come to his aid. Also, the path he decided to take was long and vigorous, filled with steep inclines and rough terrain. These combined challenges created a very difficult and potentially dangerous situation for the cyclist.
690	6669	3	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie's ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the author paints a picture of a hot, tiresome, and exhausting setting. This image emerges as the bikerider describes his surroundings: the high deserts of California in June, characterized by a hot and musky atmosphere and rough terrain. This description effectively conveys the bikerider's physical and emotional state. The reader can almost feel the bikerider's tiredness and thirst, and also sense his determination. Through the strategic use of words, metaphors, and vivid imagery, the author masterfully places the reader in the bikerider's shoes, allowing them to experience the journey both emotionally and physically. This connection highlights the bikerider's arduous journey and unwavering resolve."
691	6670	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the people around the area of @LOCATION1. Taking advice from older people in open landed place can affect the cyclist, offering insights perhaps on local routes or weather patterns. This interaction with the environment and its inhabitants can shape the cyclist's experience and choices. Ultimately, these localized interactions contribute to the cyclist's journey.
692	6671	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the settings affected the cyclist by how hard his ride is. When the road was smooth, his ride was fast; when it was the hills, it took him longer to get to the next town. The wind, another element of the setting, also played a role, sometimes pushing him along and other times creating a strong resistance. Ultimately, the external environment directly influenced the cyclist's journey and the physical demands he faced.
693	6672	3	3	"Several features of the setting affect the journey and mood of the cyclist in the text. The first feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the desert. He is ""traveling through the high deserts of California in June,"" and this is making him really thirsty. ""[He] had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly"" because of this arid environment. He later runs out of water, and becomes hopeless as a direct result. He becomes hopeless because there are no buildings or establishments anywhere in sight, meaning no water and no place to get any water. Another feature of the setting that affects him is the people that gave him directions. They told him about a shortcut, and he listened. This threw everything off, and he was left with despair. Another feature is the Gary and Wilber's fish camp. This led him to success in finding water, providing a much-needed resource. This affected his mood positively because he had hope again. In conclusion, many of the features of the setting affected his mood in many ways, significantly shaping his experience."
694	6673	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many reasons. If the setting is dark and rainy, there aren’t going to be joggers running outside. If it is snowing, the swimmers are not going to be swimming in the water. Therefore, the environmental context significantly shapes what activities are feasible and observable.
695	6674	3	3	That explains how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. It's because some people don’t care about these features. Everybody is working for a good feature, but others they @CAPS1 still steal from people who work every day to have new features. This highlights the disparity in values and ethics, where some prioritize personal gain over the effort and contributions of others, ultimately impacting the progress and fairness within the community.
696	6675	3	3	"In ìDo not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist by making him doubtfull. The cyclist is doubtfull that he wonít make it to Yosemite National Park. ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the bivas would pick me clean, leaving only some expenses outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom and their keen senses of direction.î This shows how he is doubtful, envisioning a grim end rather than reaching his destination. Finally in the story the cyclist doesnít think that they will make it, and this pervasive doubt, fueled by the challenging environment, shapes his pessimistic outlook throughout the journey."
697	6676	3	3	In the passage, the features of the setting affect the cyclist because every time he comes along something different a new idea about his survival comes into his head. First, when the cyclist sees the mule he says, ìThis sight was troubling,î he is now troubled by the fact that he had not seen a town yet and starting to doubt the old mens advise. The appearance of the mule, a beast of burden, in the desolate landscape underscores his own weariness and the apparent futility of his journey, planting seeds of doubt. Also, when he sees the juice factory he puts some pebbles in his mouth and says, ìIt didnít really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.î This shows that seeing the broken down juice factory gave him no hope and he tells his self that he will die. The factory, once a symbol of industry and sustenance, now stands as a ruin, mirroring his own decaying hope and solidifying his grim conviction that death is inevitable. Therefore, the setting directly influences his psychological state, shaping his fluctuating beliefs about his chances of survival.
698	6677	3	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting had a major impact on the character. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park, but on the way, he had some troubles; the fact that there was not much civilization affected the cyclist because he was not able to refill his water bottles, so he grew very thirsty. Also, the many hills and the fact that it is summer impacted him greatly because he became tired out more easily and could not pedal as fast. When it says, “A tar like substance oozed out Wouldn’t cool down,” it showed how he wasn’t able to drink. Also, when he passed the grape juice factory, it must have been torture to him since he was so thirsty, heightening his awareness of his parched condition. If he hadn’t taken the advice of the men in the first place he would have had a much shorter ride and would not have been so exhausted. The setting affected the cyclist a lot in this essay, proving to be a significant obstacle in his journey.
699	6678	3	3	The cyclist is beginning at what seems a fine idea and place, the sun glinting off the fresh asphalt. Then the conditions become hot, dreadful, and maybe sticky with melting tar. The constant heat without any breeze was getting to the character, sweat plastering his clothes to his skin. Mirages appeared, or so he thought, shimmering illusions of water on the road ahead. He actually thought he might die, the relentless sun beating down. Not quite an optimistic one is he? ì It didnít really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me cleanÖî The heat must have been bad, he wasnít thinking straight and was slowly checking himself into a mental center! Although painful heat was a brilliant way to learn a lesson in cycling, and the old men ìhelpingî with directions, perhaps sending him further into the scorching landscape. It was a harsh lesson indeed, learned under a merciless sun.
700	6679	3	3	As he began his journey, he had full confidence in the directions given to him by the old men. After he came to the first town and there was no water, he rode on. After he found an ìramshackle shedî he became troubled, as he ìhad been ìhittingì his ìwater bottles regularlyî and was traveling through the ìdesert of California in Juneî and was running low on water. Coming to a place where he saw a building over hills, he ìmaneuveredî his way down, only to find it long deserted and himself close to despair. He was desparate for water he needed it soon. Finally, he came upon ìWilberís Fish Campî and quenched his thirst, and was relieved. Then on he wised up, and took no more directions from old men who knew little to nothing about cycling.
701	6680	3	3	The features of the setting in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist in many ways. The first of which would definitely be the lack of water the cyclist had, and the fact that there wasn’t anywhere around for miles to resupply. From the text it read “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This evidence from the text proves to the reader that the cyclist was getting worried, and emphasizes his isolation. Another part of the setting would be the obvious element of temperature. The cyclist is out in the hot, relentless desert. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The author here, by using the elements of nature, is trying to make the reader concerned/scared for the main character, illustrating the very real danger he faces. The final key element was the distance he had to travel and the road conditions. Although the desert is generally flat, he began to notice some hills in the road; such a long distance, including the heat and inclines, could be deadly. The setting’s elements greatly affect the cyclist in this story.
702	6681	3	3	The cyclist of “Do not exceed posted speed limit” was greatly affected by the setting of his bike ride, which caused him pain and displeasure. He travels in the high deserts of California in June, exaggerating that the water there was “@NUM1 degrees.” The great heat caused him to drink lots of water, depleting it much quicker than he would’ve wished, and the sun beat down relentlessly. It also sapped the energy out of him, further complicating his ride and making each mile a struggle. Along the way there is literally nothing there and he has nowhere to replenish his water supply, compounding his dehydration. The hilly, rough terrain also calls for hard, tough peddling, sapping even more energy from his already depleted reserves. The heat, terrain, and lack of places to stop combined for an awful ride for the cyclist of this story, turning what should have been a pleasant journey into a grueling ordeal.
703	6682	3	3	"The lone biker in ìRough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limitî by @PERSON1 is strongly affected by the features of the landscape. The sun is the most important factor; it drives him to first consume his water quickly, and then drives him search for a water source. îThe sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it...I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,î in this quote, it reveals that even though the biker had not acknowledged the sun, his body had required water, depleting his supply in his water bottles. A lack of water ""feeling two hundred degrees...it had the flavor of battery acid."" The only water that the bike is able to find is not consumable, illustrating the harshness of the environment. The most important of the factors, in the matter of survival, is the fish camp that the biker finally reaches. îI stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.î The biker had been on the brink of dehydration and the fish camp is where he finally regained the strength to continue on his journey, highlighting how crucial the landscape's resources are for survival."
704	6683	3	3	Dry, thirsty, tedious-all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, everything is dry. The cyclist isn't anywhere near a town that could help him. He has been pedaling in the heat, outside for a long time. Secondly, He is very thirsty. The way he is travelling is a good sign he is in need of water. He went forty miles before he reached the first town to stop at. He also is on a bike, So that doesn't leave him much room to carry water along. Lastly, the trip is tedious. He has been going for forty miles, and the speed limit is 55. He hasn't acceded 12 mph. It's a lonely road. Altogether, the cyclist's trip seems to be adventure that takes a lot of heart.
705	6684	3	3	"The setting affects the cyclist very strongly in the story because mentally and physically he wasn't ready for where he was going. For example the text states ""No a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be never. Accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who hasn't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office."" So a young guy took bad advice from older guys; about how to get to a backpacking place. In their day it probably was a shortcut, but the landscape and conditions likely changed drastically since then, leaving the cyclist unprepared for the actual challenges he faced."
706	6685	3	3	"The setting affected the cyclist because it was very hot and he didn’t have any more water; also, there aren’t any towns that had good water in them, until he eventually arrived at this fishing competition. Due to his lack of water, he became dehydrated and really weak. The sun beat down mercilessly, exacerbating his thirst. ""With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,"" this quote shows that he was beginning to become dehydrated and losing his energy, highlighting the toll the harsh conditions were taking on him. Ultimately, dehydration severely impacted his physical capabilities."
707	6686	3	3	Different settings can effect how well your bycycle ride goes. If it is hot and you have lots of hills it makes it hard. If you have no hills and it is a sunny breezy day it makes it nice to ride. In the essay the biker had no water left but was going down a hill. The going down the hill part was probably easy, providing a welcome respite from pedaling, but the fact that he had no water left was not a good thing, especially if the downhill was followed by an uphill climb later on. The combination of easy and difficult circumstances highlights how much environment and resources can impact a bike ride.
708	6687	3	3	The setting from the story left the cyclist in a mental way because most of the time the sun was on his mind due to the fact that he was pedaling hard in a hot summer day in June. The cyclist had very little water and with him biking under a beating sun wasn't exactly helping him, as the heat shimmered off the asphalt. He had to endure disastrous events like peddling slopes at a slower than normal speed, a snake blocking the path forcing him to carefully maneuver around it, old men telling him to take a different route to avoid being infected by something unspecified, and the fact that his water supply was low made him think he was going to pass out under the burning sun. However his determination was strong as he continued on pedaling through, pushing past the fatigue and the thirst, and he eventually found himself in another town but this time with people, the scent of fresh fish in the air, and plentiful water to replenish his parched throat, proving that his will had overcome the harsh conditions.
709	6688	3	3	From the setting that affected the cyclist are possible conditions such as the weather and surrounding environment like hills and streams, or even types of animals and if they are poisonous or not. Weather, encompassing factors like rain, wind, and temperature, can drastically alter riding conditions and necessitate adjustments in speed and gear. The presence of hills dictates exertion levels and route planning, while streams might present obstacles requiring dismounting. The local fauna, particularly poisonous creatures, demands vigilance. The setting has and can change the decision a cyclist makes, influencing choices regarding route, pace, and necessary precautions to ensure safety and optimize performance.
710	6689	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the hot sun makes the cyclist dehydrated, and since there are no water sources around, the cyclist is not getting any water to replenish fluids. The rough terrain, with its uneven surfaces and challenging inclines, makes the cyclist tired and slows their progress. Consequently, this combination of factors significantly impacts the cyclist's stamina and overall performance.
711	6690	3	3	"Many features of the Californian desert influenced the cyclist during his ride. Ghost towns, rolling hills, and dangerous snakes influenced the cyclist's experience during his ""shortcut"" to Yosemite. The ghost towns along the journey symbolized the world deserting him during his ride by offering no help with water or a place to cool down. The road sign warning of rough terrain was another barrier on his bike ride that he had to get through in dehydration to reach his goal, Yosemite. The diamondback rattlesnake caused additional horror to the cyclist's ""ride from hell."" He had to maneuver around the serpent while unstable from dehydration. All features of the cyclist's riding setting affected his ride to Yosemite."
712	6691	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if it's raining or snowing, it affects the cyclist because pavement can be wet and icy, which causes the cyclist to slip and fall, and the cyclist can really get injured. Also, the cyclist has to wear a helmet, and if it's very hot outside, you wouldn't see the cyclist in winter clothes. This would make the cyclist unfocused, and the cyclist wouldn't be able to finish any race. Therefore, the environmental setting is very important because it can affect the cyclist's performance.
713	6692	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he can’t go any farther because of the hills and the snake. When he finds the bait shop he’s relieved. He’s relieved because he can get something to drink, a necessity given his exertion. He can also buy the worms to eat. The cyclist didn’t really know where he was going because there wasn’t a car, building, or structure in sight. So, the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first “town” as he calls it in the essay, a sign of civilization. When he comes across the road that has a 55 mph speed limit, and he’s only 12, he knows that he’s not going anywhere near Yosemite National Park, indicating a realization of being lost and far off course. Ultimately, the setting dictates the cyclist's journey, influencing his exhaustion, relief, and the dawning awareness of his misdirection.
714	6693	3	3	"The features of the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affects the cyclist in many ways. First the setting does not look like what the cyclist has been told it lacks like. The cyclist had stopped to get directions from a group of older men whoís directions were out of date. The cyclist states that, ""The men had been friendly, but their information was 20 years old."" Second the conditions of the road affects the cyclist. In the essay the cyclist explains that, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" The cyclist also notes that the road was also riddled with potholes which slowed the cyclist down. A final feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the temperature. The hot sun beamed down on the cyclist, causing the cyclist to overheat and become dehydrated. As you can see, the features of the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affects the cyclist in many ways."
715	6694	3	3	The different settings in the essay/ writing affect the cyclist because of how old and hopeless they look. I think this because when the cyclist stops at the first town, he’s looking around expecting to find a quaint, bustling little place, but instead he finds these abandoned, decimated old houses. And if you yourself can picture being in his situation, then you can imagine how discouraging and almost frightening that must be. As the cyclist continues for a few more miles, he’s becoming slowly dehydrated, and finally sees a building. At first, he thinks this building is a mirage; he was wrong, but for him in this situation it was worse- an old juice factory, right when you point kind of get the feeling that everything’s turning against you and that there’s no hope left. But when he finds the fishing camp, his entire perspective of things changes, and he just feels so thankful to have been saved, proving how crucial the setting is in shaping his emotional state.
716	6695	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist by the people from Lodi getting him going the wrong way, and he had to survive from there. It was very dry, with no water or anything until the next stop was the bait store, so he was determined to get to that next destination, even though he did want to give up. But then a guy asked him if he wanted directions, and he said he was not going to be fooled twice, distrustful after his earlier misdirection.
717	6696	3	3	"It can’t be known as, ""easy"" to ride through a desert on a bike. Adding rough pavement, rusty water pumps, and not so friendly animals adds to the discomfort as well. The cyclist in this story encountered all these things, making his supposedly pleasurable ride turn to a semi brutal experience. “it got down on my hands and knee, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. Alike substance ooed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,” This quote shows how the conditions of his water supply where, which eventually lead him to dehydration. It lead: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED SPEED LIMIT.” This quote also shows how the riding conditions were making the cyclist have a harder time keeping speed. “at some point tumberweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-beaked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” Moreover, this quote show of some of the dangers the cyclist encountered. If these features did not appear, then maybe the story would be describing a nice bike ride, but once you read about them, it becomes more of a disaster."
718	6697	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. It was so hot where he was that he kept drinking his water without realizing it until he only had a couple of sips left. The terrain also made him thirsty because the more he had to go up and down hills, the more he would drink. The fact that he did not see any town except a ghost town for miles affected him because he did not think he was going to make it to the next town. The oppressive heat, combined with the arduous landscape and isolation, significantly impacted his morale and physical state. The setting played a major role on the cyclist because it affected him that much.
719	6698	3	3	Setting plays a big role in this story. Without being in the desert in the hot summer there would not be a conflict. There would be no importance in saving the water so he would not dehydrate. And the long flat roads are a symbol that the journey has still got a far way to go, but as straight roads turn into hills it shows that there is a change in the journey and something better is about to happen, signifying a shift in circumstances and offering a glimmer of hope for a more positive outcome.
720	6699	3	3	The setting affect is used to a great extent in the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The cyclist had been going for a very long time when he came to the first town, and there was no water. At this point, you can tell that he has lost confidence in the “old timers'” directions. From this quote, “a ton-like substance oozed out,” this shows how, after 80 miles of pedaling, when he was supposed to have come to two towns by that point, his one chance of water had been depleted. The next time the setting affect is used is when he comes to a building that was rusted out. He said, “I hung my head.” This shows how he almost completely lost all hope and that he was sure that he was going to die, highlighting the setting's impact on his emotional state and diminishing chances of survival.
721	6700	3	3	The cyclist is affected by a couple different things. First, he is given directions that are out of date, causing him to lose valuable time and energy, and then he has to deal with the intense heat of the weather in the early summer of California. If that wasn't enough, he then runs out of water, which he needs very badly to combat the dehydration. He runs into a couple more problems, like startling a big snake sunning itself on the road and coming to a factory that used to make juice, a place he thought might offer respite, but it was now run down and empty, offering no help. After all of these obstacles, the cyclist pulls through, demonstrating resilience, and makes it to a fishing store, where he finally gets water and replenishes his depleted supplies, resolving his immediate crisis.
722	6701	3	3	During the cyclist's biking adventure he encounters several interesting situations. Each experience is in response to the setting in which it takes place. For example, this young man starts out confident with a bright hope of eventually reaching Yosemite National Park. The first spot he comes to is a ghost town. This sight doesn't immediately affect him, however it greatly adds on to the long term effects. He decides to continue on his trek, reaching the next ghost town; at this time he is becoming dehydrated due to his lack of water supply. He decides to keep pursuing his goal and figures there must be water up ahead in the next town. In order to get to the next town he must encounter some precarious situations, including some changes in terrain, such as steep inclines and rocky paths. Eventually, after reaching a source of running water, he is overjoyed with happiness and relief. As evident in the provided text, this man was affected by each feature of the setting. The different settings greatly affected his nature of confidence, slowly chipping away at it until the discovery of water renewed his spirits.
723	6702	3	3	The setting effects the rider because if itís hot you get thirsty and you have no water. This kind of question is hard to answer because the environment significantly impacts the rider; for instance, intense heat can lead to dehydration if the rider lacks sufficient water. Therefore, understanding the setting is crucial for addressing the challenges the rider faces.
724	6703	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making the journey more dangerous and difficult. For example, in the reading it states that ridiculously large, poisonous diamondback snakes blocked the majority of the pavement. So, the cyclist had to keep his/her balance to ease past them, a precarious situation demanding focus and control. The terrain also changed into short, rolling hills, making it even more difficult to maintain speed and requiring greater physical exertion. These environmental challenges combined to significantly increase the overall difficulty and danger faced by the cyclist.
725	6704	3	3	The features in the setting of the essay affect the author in one major way, dehydration. There are several features that cause the author to dehydrate. First off, he is riding through a desert located in California. This means that there is intense heat from the sun constantly beating down on him. Also the change from “flat road,” (Kurmaskie) to “short, rolling hills” also affected him, getting dehydrated. This change caused him to use more energy to climb up the hills which means he used more water because he got thirstier faster; he was exerting himself more in the heat. All of these elements combined to create a situation where the author was losing fluids rapidly, emphasizing how the harsh environment contributed directly to his dehydration.
726	6705	3	3	"The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. For example, the tough terrain made it very difficult for the cyclist to reach his destination, Yosemite. He was already very fatigued but had to overcome hills. In the essay, he states, “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" These hills sapped his energy and slowed his progress. The setting features also affected the cyclist when he encountered the snake. He was dehydrated and could barely navigate around the dangerous snake. The cyclist explains, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake, it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased fast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" The heat likely contributed to his dehydration, making the encounter even more perilous. The setting also affected the cyclist because there was no one around him to help. The cyclist describes, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The cyclist was all alone and had to rely on himself to make it to Yosemite. In conclusion, the features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. He had to overcome rugged terrain without energy, avoid a diamondback snake, and make it all the way to Yosemite because there was no one around to offer assistance, highlighting the profound impact of the environment on his journey. As you can see, the features of the setting affect the cyclist."
727	6706	3	3	The harsh features of the land around the cyclist caused him to confront nature. When he began his trip with advice from ìold coggersî he ìrode out with strong legs and a smile.î As he came to the first town, he describes it as a ìghost townî having no water and no human contact for some time. This should have been his cue to stop and turn around in hopes of another route to Yosemite. But with strong determination, he rode on. Through the miles he encountered a ramshackle shed, rusty pumps that offered no respite, snakes slithering across his path, and the wicked terrain. The short rolling hills tested his ìinner spiritî and caused his dehydration to further worsen. The land around the cyclist not only victimized his health but also caused a poor way to spend a vacation, turning what should have been a pleasant journey into a grueling ordeal.
728	6707	3	3	The harsh features at the setting affect the cyclist by hindering his journey to Yosemite National Park. As the cyclist is traveling along ìThe high deserts of California in Juneî, some problems arise. The heat from the pounding sun in the desert takes a toll on the cyclist, causing him to drink more water and rapidly deplete his supply. This makes the journey more arduous, as the cyclist must constantly be aware of his hydration levels. The cyclist is also traveling through small ìghost townsî rather than stopping at appropriate rest stops in order to refill with water and relax. This lack of proper rest exacerbates the physical strain. Also while traveling he encounters hazards such as ìshort rolling hillsî through the terrain and even a snake. These unexpected obstacles further deplete his energy and increase the risk of injury. All of these features in the setting impair the cyclist's ability to maintain confidence in whether he will make it to his destination and his positive attitude toward the journey, making the already challenging ride even more mentally taxing. Ultimately, these environmental and situational factors conspire to create a significantly more difficult and uncertain path for the cyclist reaching Yosemite.
729	6708	3	3	Cycling is a very good sport; people who do cycling are in shape. Also, they have strong calve muscles. I think it's also dangerous as well, since cyclists share roads with cars and trucks. Ultimately, the benefits and risks should be weighed carefully before engaging in this activity.
730	6709	3	3	In the story the author says, ìThe sun was beginning to beat down trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,î This gives you the idea that the heat is getting to him and is steadily depleting his water supply. He is physically struggling, and the sun is contributing to his weakening condition. At one point he almost gives himself up to despair and dies of dehydration. It seems that he will never reach his goal and he will continue to suffer in the grueling heat. I could almost feel the sweat and heat that the cyclist was feeling. Also, I could almost feel the lump in my throat when he says, ìwith any luck Iíd hit a bump and lodge a pebble in my throat.î This illustrates the depth of his desperation and the lengths his mind is going to for relief. The heat definitely affects this man's cycling in a bad way. He was exhausted and could not go on without water, and the oppressive heat was a major factor in his near defeat.
731	6710	3	3	The cyclist thought it was hard, the steep incline burning his thighs. Also he was upset that the old timers gave bad directions, leading him further astray on the already challenging route.
732	6711	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First, he couldn't get water from anywhere because he was in a desert with nothing but ramshackle sheds and rusty camps, offering no respite or resources. Second, there were short rolling hills and rough roads which made it hard to ride on, constantly challenging his stamina and control. There were tumbleweeds in his way and large poison snakes, adding danger and obstacles to his path. The heat made it hard to keep riding, sapping his strength with each passing mile. And there were no buildings, structures, or people around to give him a lift or water, leaving him utterly isolated. That is how the harsh desert setting profoundly affects the cyclist, hindering his progress and threatening his well-being at every turn.
733	6712	3	3	In this essay by Joe Kurmaskie, a young man is baited into accepting outdated information by a group of old men. He pays for it later when on his bicycle, he is almost killed by heatstroke or dehydration. The setting is an excellent way to portray his feelings of hopelessness, despair, and fatigue. While he is just starting out, the road is flat and easy. It is cool and breezy, reflecting his initial confidence. When he begins to run out of water, the terrain becomes bumpier and harder, mirroring his increasing struggle. He sees empty plains, cracked, dry ground, and the hot sun, intensifying his feelings of isolation and desperation. He begins to despair even more. After a while when he thinks he can go no more he sees a store that once held gallons of grape juice. He laughs at the irony, a bitter acknowledgment of his predicament. The setting does do a wonderful job of describing his sense of helplessness, underscoring the harsh reality of his situation and the consequences of the old men's misleading advice.
734	6713	3	3	"In this passage, the cyclist was affected by the setting because if it had been anywhere else, he would not have suffered or learned at all. Because the setting had both a lack of civilization and water that he needed, that caused him to almost faint of thirst. This is an example of the setting affecting the cyclist. ""With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill."" This shows that had the setting been paradise, he would never have learned anything about his own resilience."
735	6714	3	3	The features of the setting in the essay caused the cyclist to suffer and continue being determined. The author of the essay used phrases such as ëthe sun was beating downî and ìhigh deserts of California in Juneî to emphasize the extreme heat that caused the cyclist extreme thirst and heat exhaustion. The essay also says ìshort rolling hillsî, ìtumbleweedsî and ìlong, crippling hillî to describe the difficult terrain the cyclist faced that caused him to be tired and slower. These details highlight the physical challenge of the ride. Finally, the cyclist is faced with a ìrediculously large snakeî and plants and weeds which get in his way and force him to slow down, adding elements of fear and frustration to his ordeal. The harsh environment, therefore, tests the cyclist's physical and mental fortitude, ultimately fueling his determination to overcome these obstacles.
736	6715	3	3	The setting effects the cyclist very much. By the very dry climates, the cyclist's hydration becomes a primary concern, impacting performance and overall well-being.
737	6716	3	3	"The setting in the story ""Rough road ahead"" plays a great role on the characters journey. Some features that are mentioned in the story are heat, rough road, long crippling hills and a abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst. She does her best to conserve her water through out the trip but the dry dessert heat doesn’t allow it. Then comes the rough road ahead, testing her endurance. The cyclist trys to keep a steady and secure pass as she peddels along the bumps and breaks in the road. The long crippling hills are next in line; the cyclist has to use all her energy to work up the hill, each rotation of the pedals a monumental effort. She wipes the sweat from her eyes to make sure its not a mirage and then she see’s it the abandoned factory. This is where the cyclist loses all hope for if she didn’t receive water soon she is sure to be eaten by the birds. “Then, and easily as rounding a band, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. Gary and Wilber Fish Camp.” She rushed to the bathroom to drink the refreshing water to the sink pride and accomplishment overwhelm her, showing how crucial the setting was in shaping her physical and emotional ordeal and ultimately, her triumph."
738	6717	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it gives him the feeling of hopelessness. When the cyclist got directions to Yosemite from these two *unnamed* old people, he thought he was getting a good shortcut. In reality, he was just led on a road that seemed to head nowhere where he saw many things that added to his feeling of hopelessness, for example, the author writes, ì I toiled on. At some points, tumbleweeds crossed my path and an adversely large snake. It really did move like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This shows that the cyclist is getting tired and seeing tumbleweeds, which usually represents a phase being completely deserted and deadly snakes that get in his way. This answers the question because it shows how the setting leads to his feeling of hopelessness."
739	6718	3	3	The story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was a rough, undergoing story about a cyclist going through rough climate and terrain. In this story the description was like a scorching path of nothingness for about as far for human eyes could see. In paragraph @NUM1 the text says “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could die from heatstroke” is empressed how the climate felt. This explains the heat and how he felt during this experience, emphasizing the cyclist's dire situation. This whole trip sounds suffering, highlighting the arduous nature of the journey and the cyclist's struggle for survival.
740	6719	3	3	The features of a setting can affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, while he was riding in the hot sun he became very thirsty because he only had a few drops of water left. The rough, uphill terrain also slowed his pace considerably, making the journey even more arduous. That is how the setting can affect the cyclist.
741	6720	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. They make it hard to concentrate, because of its heat; they make it unbearable. The setting has the affect of drowsiness and thirst, ìDry bitter land, longing, longing.î This makes the ride not only physically taxing, but mentally grueling as well.
742	6721	3	3	In many ways, the setting affected his journey to Yosemite. If the setting wouldn't have been so bad, the long ride wouldn't have been as hard on his body. Since the setting was a very hot day in June, in a California desert, when he did find a well he said, “I followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” One thing about the setting is, if it wouldn't have been so hot, he wouldn't have needed as much water. And, if he would have gotten the water he needed because it was so hot, it wouldn't have been so physically draining on his body. I know it was physically draining because he said “I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The oppressive heat of the desert environment, with its scarce and unpalatable water sources, clearly amplified the physical challenges he faced. In conclusion, the setting played a major role in the story.
743	6722	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the man was riding a bike through rough lands. His adventure wouldn’t have been an adventure if he was just riding his bike on a flat, smooth element. The fact that the hills were steep, rocky, and numerous is what made his bike ride what it was. The challenging terrain tested his endurance and skill, turning a simple ride into a memorable and demanding journey. Ultimately, it was the difficulty of the path that defined the experience.
744	6723	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, starting with the old timers' advice of how to get somewhere. Then, the town they told him to go to was a ghost town. After he kept going, the place that they told him to get water was very old and rusty, and when he pumped it, black tar came out. Then, as he made his way into the desert, a snake came into the road, and he went around it. So, never take advice from old timers, as the harsh and unreliable environment ultimately proved their guidance to be misleading.
745	6724	3	3	"In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist by showing the rough conditions he went through, and somehow persevered through. The author states numerous times the lack of water, and the rolling hills made for a physically taxing ride. Followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,"" further illustrating the harsh environment. This shows the struggle he went through and supports the setting of the story and how it affected his trip. This also shows how he persevered through his struggles and made an effort to finish, highlighting his resilience in the face of adversity."
746	6725	3	3	The rider's condition was rough, from flat land to rolling hills. This would be hard for someone who is dehydrating, making each pedal stroke a monumental effort. There was a snake in his path so he went around it. This would be dangerous; he could blackout from lack of water and then get bit by the snake, compounding an already dire situation, proving that dehydration can introduce numerous risks.
747	6726	3	3	The cyclist depicted in the essay is greatly affected by his surroundings. First, he describes a beating sun and pines and rushing rivers. All these items are very animated things. The river is even described as rushing instead of, maybe violent, emphasizing its vitality. The setting is active just like the cyclist, full of energy and life. Next, a ramshackle shed is acknowledged, as well as rusty pumps and a bad sounding corral. When these old, forsaken things are mentioned, it can be noticed that the cyclist starts being a little in despair, reflecting the decay he observes. And to tap that off, he drinks water that tastes like “battery acid.” Battery eats at skin just like the setting is eating at the cyclist, eroding his initial vigor and optimism, illustrating how powerfully environment can shape experience and mood.
748	6727	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Aheadî the setting is able to affect the cyclists emotions and moods in both positive and negative ways. As the author travels through the desert he is already upset because it is so hot and water is scarce, showing how the terrain is a negative influence on his well-being. Another example would be when the author first sees the old water pump and he is relieved, demonstrating a positive influence from the environment. However, the pump oozes a shiny substance he refers to as tasting like ìbattery acidî, immediately changing his mood for the worse. Finally, the act of putting pebbles in his mouth shows his desperation and willingness to try anything to survive, illustrating a new, albeit unusual, positive outlook driven by the desert's harshness. This positive outlook is short-lived, though, as a pump ìlodges in his throatî, making it yet another negative influence. All of these features, both positive and negative, propel him on his way to ìGary and will fish campî and ground an extra boost on his journey through the desert, showcasing how the environment directly impacts his resilience and determination.
749	6728	3	3	"The features of the setting affect him because it is hot and there is nowhere to go. An example from the text is when they said, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" There was also a part where he got to a sign that said ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The speed limit was 55 mph, yet he was doing a water-depleting 12 mph, further emphasizing his struggle. Sometimes life can feel so cruel, and that's what affected the cyclist: the heat, the hilly roads, no water, snakes, rough roads, and most of all, no directions. All these elements combined to create a truly harsh and unforgiving environment that significantly impacted his journey and well-being."
750	6729	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because of where they were. It was like in the middle of nowhere, and seemingly every person they asked was having Alzheimer's symptoms. They got the wrong directions to the nearest town multiple times. The old guy told him it was @NUM1 miles down the road when he went @NUM2 miles and reached the next town. Frustrated, he said to himself he would never take directions from a guy that has Alzheimer's and hasn’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office; his experience demonstrates the challenges posed by unreliable information in a remote and isolated environment.
751	6730	3	3	When the cyclist is in the serenity of an early sunset evening, the man enjoyed his cycling just hoping he could cut his time in half. Then, once he got the advice and headed down the road he saw a ghost town which is never good, casting a shadow of unease on his journey. Next he came to the fork and the town he came to had no water. On the way to the new town he came to the bumpy road and going @NUM1 he was out of water but finally after his determination he made it to a place that was very nice, a welcome reward after the trials. So as you can tell the features of the scenery road affected him greatly.
752	6731	3	3	I think that the setting, with its vast and unforgiving desert stretching before him, made him find more courage inside himself to save his water after his canteen cracked, and go to the next town without any water. The sheer desperation of his situation, the knowledge that survival depended on his resolve, forced him to confront his fear. This harsh environment, devoid of comfort and teeming with potential dangers, stripped away any illusions and revealed a strength he didn't know he possessed, allowing him to undertake the perilous journey. Ultimately, the setting was instrumental in unlocking his inner bravery.
753	6732	3	3	The environment affected the cyclist violently in the story “I Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” It seems that all of the harsh conditions of cycling in California wore down this kid who took some faulty directions from older people at one stop. The heat and lack of water supply made the boy dehydrated. It says in the essay, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen.” This explains how simply exhausted he had become due to the miles of cycling, and the beating down sun and total lack of water due to the absence of towns. He came to the point of almost dying from heat exhaustion because of the faulty directions of the old people, and the unforgiving landscape only exacerbated his predicament. Next time, he better make sure to keep extra water and stick to the map for directions to avoid such a dangerous situation again.
754	6733	3	3	"As the cyclist makes his journey towards Yosemite, the setting causes him much worry and concern. In the beginning, the narrator is content and excited. He is doing something that he loves, is heading for a beautiful destination, and has found a short cut to save him hours of time. He is confident in the directions given to him by the old men. However, as he continues down the winding road, his environment makes him doubt their judgement. The first town he comes to is entirely deserted. Though at first he laughs it off, he later realizes just how much trouble he is in if he doesn't come to a civilization soon. The cyclist runs across ""ramshackle shed[s]"" and shut down factories, and as his water supply sinks lower, the road seems to tantalize him with false hope. He passes a water pump (just what he needs), yet the water is something close to toxic and unusable. A road sign reminds him not to go too fast, though he might die if he doesn't pick up the pace. He is forced to look at a picture of a happy boy guzzling grape juice as he dehydrates. All these features of the setting, in addition to the overpowering heat and sun, drive the narrator to the breaking point, making him question his initial optimism and the wisdom of the shortcut."
755	6734	3	3	The feature of setting affects the cyclist because everything that was happening years ago is happening now in today's world, meaning wars, rights, and etcetera. Today's feature is the same; everything is repeating itself. It is as if the challenges faced in the past are resurfacing, influencing the present landscape and, consequently, impacting the cyclist's journey through contemporary society. This cyclical nature suggests that understanding historical contexts is crucial for navigating current obstacles.
756	6735	3	3	When riding a bike it may not seem to hard. For a cyclist every thing becomes more serious. The determination to win and be the best even if it kills you. In this essay he under estimates the harder cyclist. When really they are the people with more knowledge. Some of the things that may be hard for cyclist are the rough roads. Not only having a chance to be killed of dehydration or being ran over. Riding bike is really hard work when having to ride in hundred degree weather. Drinking drink after drink never having any water. No water and it being so hot could cause a heat stroke. As road get worse chances get higher tumble weeds and snakes in the way, he was determined to win. After all was said and he faced the horror that nature brought him he knew he was wrong wrong for them and the intelligants, showing that the dedication of cyclists is often underestimated, and their expertise is hard-earned and genuinely valuable.
757	6736	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. The fact that he was in the California desert and the heat affected him because he had limited water and was using his energy riding the bike. The ìtownsî he came across also made an impact on him because of the fact that he couldnít get more water or a place to rest. The lack of resources in these locales exacerbated his already difficult situation. ìI was doing a water depleting @NUM1 sometimes life can feel so cruelî. This shows how the hilly terrain and dehydration and heat are affecting the cyclist, creating a truly challenging and harsh experience for him.
758	6737	3	3	Two of the biggest setting in this story is the desert and rolling hills. This would effect the rider because of the dehydration that he would experience. Being in the desert would make it obviously hot, causing him to sweat a lot and lose crucial fluids. The hills would make it tough on his body because he would put extra strain to get up them, taxing his muscles and energy reserves. So all together, considering both the arid environment and the demanding terrain, this would be a hard bike ride, pushing the rider to their physical limits and requiring careful resource management.
759	6738	3	3	In the story, ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist experiences dehydration on his journey. The cyclist takes directions from older guys who look like they havenít left their porches in ages. He takes their advice and he then suffers in the long run because he cannot find water and it is a hot summer day. He hikes uphills in the heating sun and fears a heat stroke. There was no sight, not a building, car, or even a puddle to offer some relief. Thus, the cyclist's reliance on questionable advice leads to a difficult and potentially dangerous situation due to dehydration.
760	6739	3	3	"The setting will either affect the cyclist in a good way or a bad way. In the story ""Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie, it affects the cyclist in both negative and positive ways. The story frequently mentions the lack of water. ""When I tried a drop or two it had the flavor of battery acid."" This shows that the heat made the water warm, so it did not cool him down effectively. But a good way it affects them is pebbles. ""I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to linger."" This demonstrates that even though he has no water, the pebbles can provide some relief from thirst. This is how the setting affects the cyclist, in both a good way and a bad way, impacting his journey and well-being."
761	6740	3	3	"In this story it is clear how difficult the cyclist's journey is. He has to conquer wrong directions, lack of water, rattle snakes and fear of dying. However he shows great determination and control. An example of his determination is ""The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that."" This shows his determination that he feels he can go on such a long journey. An example of his self-control is shown in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. When finding this building to be abandoned, and all things, juice, anyone use would have become frustrated and wanted to give up. But not this cyclist he controlled his anger and again showed determination. And it paid off in the end he found his water and survived. This story is a great story that shows determination and self control. The cyclist's success in overcoming these obstacles highlights the importance of inner strength and resilience."
762	6741	3	3	Early in the morning, the cyclist is eager and ready to face the adventurous path that had been mapped out by the older travelers. He hardly noticed the sun was beginning to beat down. He was calm and was looking forward to the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite. Never once did he imagine what he had gotten himself into. As he began to approach the desert, he noticed he was running low on water. The strenuous activity of biking combined with the scorching heat of the desert began to take effect. The cyclist was so desperate for water that he had to put pebbles into his mouth. He had once read that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. The cyclist was hoping for a way out of the misery he had come across. Dehydration took its toll, and he felt hallucinations. He was beginning to lose hope. The heat and the hills and the lack of water had the greatest affect on the cyclist. Had he not been riding through a hilly desert one afternoon in June, he would have been fine. It was the convergence of these factors that led him to such a desperate state, highlighting the importance of preparation and awareness when undertaking challenging journeys.
763	6742	3	3	"In the cyclist story, the setting took a huge roll on how the story thinned out. The water had a lot of effects on the cyclist. The setting of the story took place in the high deserts of California in June. As soon as you read that, you know something is wrong. In the story he says, the sun was beginning to beat down. This is going to affect him because he's riding through the desert on a bike, which causes him to become dehydrated. ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" He's beginning to lose his mind because he has no water because of the setting. Everything about the setting causes the cyclist some problems. The heat, the setting, the lack of water almost costs him his life, showcasing how crucial the environment is to the cyclist's ordeal and the narrative's progression."
764	6743	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a lot of ways. The first way is that he was riding in the middle of a desert in June. If he was riding in Alaska, it wouldn't be painfully hot. Also, the rolling hills probably didn't help; if it was mostly downhill, he would have been fine. Riding a bike up a hill when you're tired is near impossible, especially with the sun beating down. These environmental factors combined to make his ride incredibly challenging.
765	6744	3	3	In the story ìDo not exceed posted speed limitî by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the path to Yosemite National Park greatly affected the cyclist. On the way to the park the cyclist came across a big snake that covered the road which greatly frightened the biker. Also the roads were long and very bumpy and windy. The road wasnít the most comfortable to be riding on. There was nothing in sight for the cyclist to see, offering no visual distraction from the arduous journey. The cyclist did not have much energy because he had no hope for him. The author states, ìÖ gaining elevation while loosing hope.î Lastly, the weather was hot and dry which tired the cyclist out. He had no water with him and with the weather he had no energy or hope to help him through the journey to Yosemite National Park, making the ride even more physically and mentally taxing. These combined challenges of terrain, weather, and lack of supplies significantly diminished the cyclist's morale and his ability to complete his journey.
766	6745	3	3	In the story ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed limit the cyclist expirenced a few life threating times during his adventure. The first feature was when was in a deseret with temptures of @NUM1 degrees and his lit bit of water tasted like battery acid. As he tried to keep going he lost hope and thought he was going to die. This affected him because as he lost hope he thought more negative about things and didnít think he would make it but the he got the agility to move on. In this story the setting affects the characters dramatically. The extreme heat and the tainted water pushed him to his physical and mental limits. Overcoming such adversity demonstrates how deeply the harsh environment impacted his struggle and eventual resilience.
767	6746	3	3	The feature of the setting is making the cyclist frustrated, thirsty, and confused. The features are making him frustrated because he thought he was going the right way when he really was going out, leading to increasing disorientation and discomfort.
768	6747	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the features are what cause the climax of the story. An example of this would be the line, ìI had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California.î This line shows that the author was in a very hot and arid place, being in a desert, but also that he has a low water supply, suggesting a challenging environment. These two conditions are what cause the climax, which is the possibility that he could collapse any minute from heat exhaustion, facing a potentially life-threatening situation. This is why the features of the setting directly and dramatically affect the cyclist.
769	6748	3	3	"Certain features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his experiences when he cycled through the desert. He ""...arrived at the first town""...it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. At first, the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little skeptical of it because the old ""codgers"" told it to be thriving. Halfway through his journey, he stated, ""sometimes life can be so cruel."" Water was running low, and he still had a ways to go until he made it to the park, and he felt as if it would never end. All that he sees around him are hills of nothingness under the scorching sun with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist, emphasizing his isolation. The ghost town and the lack of shade or succor are very features of the setting that make the cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men, highlighting how the unforgiving environment amplified his regret."
770	6749	3	3	The setting of the cyclist affected him by making him very hot and quickly depleting his water supply, meaning he would soon run out of water and dehydrate. For example, in the story the cyclist would frequently bring up the little bit of water he had left, and throughout the essay he talked about the dehydration he was experiencing and even the potential for death. Another example is the relief he expressed when he finally drank water from the sink. In conclusion, this illustrates how the harsh setting had a detrimental effect on the cyclist.
771	6750	3	3	This paragraph tells about how careful you should be on the roads. This also talks about what you have to be aware of, such as other drivers and pedestrians. There are so many things that could happen, from unexpected stops to sudden lane changes. You have to take control when you're on the road, staying focused and making responsible decisions to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you.
772	6751	3	3	"The features of the setting in ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist in many ways. For example it states ""This place might have been a thriving little spot before the last world war it fit the tradition definition of a ghost town."" This statement is talking about the town he arrived at when he was trying to get to Yosemite. This would affect the cyclist because he was riding in confidence in the beginning, but then the first town he arrives in looks like a ghost town, which would bring his confidence a little bit lower than before. The desolation emphasizes his isolation. Just like when people travel when they know where they are going they feel good, but once they come to a place they don't know then they wont feel so confident. Another example is when he has to ride on rolling hills, and then comes across a ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" sign. This would affect the cyclist because then he would be frustrated and stressed out because he rode all that way and now he cant go any further, and that is not the place he wanted to be at. The jarring sign clashes with his expectations of smooth progress. Therefore the features of the setting in ""Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie ultimately affects the cyclist's mood and journey."
773	6752	3	3	The conditions that the bicyclist faced that affected his trip were various amount of things that could really screw your ride up. Some of the conditions were hot. It was very hot, and that makes it hard to think fast, move fast, and make good decisions. Another would be there was lose gravel, and that makes it tough to maneuver, and you have to watch your speed, so he's not going anywhere in a hurry. Also, there were lots of hills, and that makes for an uncomfortable ride and a tiring one at that. Adding to that, he was fresh out of water, and that can mean dehydration, again bad judgment, and even heat stroke or exhaustion. Another bad thing is he was in the middle of nowhere, so it's not like he could stop somewhere we asks for a drink too; there was nothing around for miles. These things show how rough the road was made because these conditions existed, ultimately making for a very challenging and potentially dangerous bicycle ride.
774	6753	3	3	The setting was very hot and dry; it was a desert. This setting affected him because it was making him very dehydrated and hot. The sun beat down mercilessly, each mile an agonizing test of endurance. It was very hard for him to go any further, but he knew he had to keep going, his destination a distant shimmer on the horizon. Also, the land was very barren and everything around was parched, offering no respite from the heat. Clearly, the setting affected the biker, pushing him to his physical and mental limits as he battled the harsh environment.
775	6754	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because they were in California in June traveling back roads, with no place to stop for water. This combination of intense heat and isolation made the ride particularly challenging. If the cyclist would have followed the path they intended on following, the ride probably would have been more enjoyable and he/she wouldn’t have had to worry about a heatstroke or running out of water; access to planned rest stops and resources would have mitigated those risks. They would have been fine, suggesting the importance of sticking to planned routes, especially in demanding environments.
776	6755	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. There were hills and rocks, snakes and no buildings or people. The hills and rocks would make it much harder to to stay strong and be able to keep riding. The snakes also presented a danger, adding a constant threat of a bite. The abandoned building and there being no people, could affect him emotionally. It would make him loose hope and the determination to keep going to find destination. He did not think he would get that after seeing a deserted town. After all, he did say, ìIt didnít really matter. I was going to die Ö ì(Kurmaskie). The harsh environment, devoid of human contact, clearly contributed to his despair and acceptance of what he perceived as his inevitable fate.
777	6756	3	3	The main features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the fact that it was June and the dessert heat. “I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June…” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This helps us realize how bad the heat is in June in the middle of the California desert. This affected the cyclist by his dehydration and the fact that he was in the middle of nowhere with no one to help him. This isolation exacerbated the danger posed by the intense heat. This is how the month of June and the desert heat affected the cyclist.
778	6757	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in this story. First, when he got to the road sign that said “Rough Road Ahead” he was already low on water, but that made things much worse. The rough road made it harder for him to pedal; therefore, he was working harder and getting thirsty. Also, when he stopped at the old Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, he noticed some pebbles on the ground and shoved them in his mouth. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing spit you have left to circulate”. Lastly, “GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP”, could possibly have saved the cyclist’s life. He stopped there and finally got a well deserved drink of water to settle his dehydration and fear. The setting and features severely affected the cyclist throughout his journey, impacting his thirst, his coping mechanisms, and ultimately, his survival.
779	6758	3	3	"In ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî, the features of the setting affect how the author feels. In the beginning of the essay, the author is confident and happy, and the setting is, ìa reservoir camp ground outside at Lodi, Californiaî (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This sounds like a good place to be refreshed and to feel confident, suggesting a positive influence from the environment. Later into the bike ride, the author is affected negatively by the barren area he comes to when he says, ìThis sight was troubling"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1), showing how the harsh landscape impacted his mood. Finally when he reaches a modern store, he is relieved due to the modern facility when he states, ìThen, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind meî (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The area the author goes through has an effect, as seen by the shift from confidence, to trouble, and finally to relief, proving the setting's powerful influence on his emotional state."
780	6759	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they don’t ride as much anymore and don’t know the best routes to take. So, they just take their old routes, thinking they are still the better way, but when they use them they realize how tiring and bad they are. The increased traffic and new construction have rendered those once-ideal paths unpleasant and inefficient, proving that familiar routes are not always the best choice in a changing landscape, and their ride becomes more of a struggle.
781	6760	3	3	ìAt some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path..î being out in the desert with limited or no water can make one feel like life is very cruel. The sun was beating down and no water or shade is seen when he reaches a point. The sign that said ìRough roads ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.î had to be intimidating. Considering he was on a bike he could only move so fast. Those old men probably were never off their front porch since Carter was in office. Yes, like the writer said, ìthe world is a fluid place. Things change.î The old men probably had close to no idea what they were talking about considering things have changed since the 70s (when Carter was in office). The snake that he came upon, must have been rather intimidating. Knowing there is a creature like that, there is bound to be more. In essence, I think the setting was a major part of why the cyclist felt that way.
782	6761	3	3	From what there is in this picture the cyclist is riding a dry area which could mean that it is very hot and the cyclist looks to be going downhill; there looks to be a lot of turns. From the body position of the cyclist he seems to be trying at his best and hardest to make it to his destination. All of this could be a big stress on the cyclist; he maybe sweating really hard and maybe tired; the wind might not be helping him at all. The challenging terrain and apparent heat suggest the cyclist is facing a tough ride overall.
783	6762	3	3	In the short story ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limitî by Joshua Chaplinsky, a cyclist travels through an extreme climate and tough terrain that nearly end his life to get to his destination. After getting outdated directions from some elderly locals, the protagonist sets off on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Soon thereafter, the cyclist notices something is amiss. The first ìtownî the locals said heíd find is deserted. And now, twenty miles into his journey, the cyclist needs to refill some of his water supply. The water pump there has ìthe flavor of battery acid.î With the next town 30 miles away, the cyclist struggles to conserve his water to make it there. Even then, things get worse. As he is, ìtraveling through the high deserts of California in Juneî, ìflat road was replaced by short rolling hills.î Chaplinsky tell him not to exceed the speed limit of 25 as he does a ìwater-depleting 35 mph.î eventually, even on his few sips of water, the cyclist finds a spot to fill up on water, knowing now to strike out on better days and better directions, a lesson learned from a near-fatal misadventure.
784	6763	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. When she was riding it was very hot; this caused the cyclist to lose energy and dehydrate, impacting her performance. Also when the cyclist went through a terrain change, the road changed into rolling hills. This caused the cyclist to become tired because after riding up and down your body gets tired from the constant exertion. Also, being as the weather was so hot, this caused the cyclist to drink a lot of water to try and stay cool and hydrated. Eventually, she ran out and then got dehydrated, further hindering her progress. This whole situation implied to stick to your original plan, including accounting for supplies and environmental factors. If the cyclist would have done that, she wouldn’t have had to go through the hardships of fatigue and dehydration, thus highlighting the importance of preparation.
785	6764	3	3	Each new feature of the setting in the essay entitled, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, affects the cyclist in some way. For example, in the text, when the narrator stated that he had to avoid a “ridiculously large snake” crossing the road, he became more aware of his surroundings and almost seemed to forget how thirsty he was until he finally abided the large reptile. The snake, a sudden and imposing obstacle, forced him to focus sharply on the immediate present. Also in the text, when, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view,” hope was replenished into the cyclist. This hope allowed the narrator to become more tenacious about his journey in order to arrive at the old building, the sight of civilization acting as a powerful motivator. Whether for better or worse, a few features of the setting arrive and affect the cyclist every step of his journey, influencing his focus, motivation, and overall experience.
786	6765	3	3	Many features of the setting of the cyclistís excruciating trip affect him mentally and physically. When he first sets out, the pine trees and rivers kept him cheerfully riding through the landscape. When he sees the corral and the rusty pumps, he becomes discouraged and begins to notice his tiredness and thirst. When the cyclist encounters a rough terrain with tumble weeds and snakes, he is both mentally and physically exhausted. He begins to doubt his consciousness and worries that he will not complete the journey. The abandoned grape juice factory is also a let down for the cyclistís mental state. When all hope is seemingly lost, he finally comes across water, and his unique (but very important) lesson is learned, showing how environmental factors impact not only physical endurance but also mental fortitude during challenging journeys.
787	6766	3	3	"The features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist. I know this because in the story the cyclist said that he was ""going to drop from heat exhaustion,"" he is riding through the desert in August, and he took directions from three old ""gentlemen"" sitting on a porch. This harsh environment clearly impacted his physical state, and the presence of the porch suggests a rare, perhaps isolated, outpost of civilization. Thus, the setting's challenging conditions and hints of human presence influenced the cyclist's experience."
788	6767	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, since he was in a desert, the heat of the desert greatly dehydrated him on his journey to find spare parts. Also, the bumpy roads and rolling hills slowed the bike down to 12 mph since it was too extreme for him to handle at high speeds. When he sees the first building, he is relieved, but soon after, he loses all his hope because it is deserted. Even the old men living in the area have an effect on the cyclist because they give him out-dated directions that almost strand him. Because of this, he will probably rest first in one of the old men’s short tents again. This is how the harsh features of the setting severely tested the cyclist's resolve and impacted his journey.
789	6768	3	3	Well first off its very hot and dry witch can dry a person out easily. And the hills are hard to get up so it would be a challange to get to the top. All I know is the lack of water can kill you if you get heatstroaks easily. The sun's intensity combined with the dryness accelerates dehydration. Those steep hills demand significant physical exertion, making the climb even more difficult. Consequently, the risk of heatstroke is greatly increased without proper hydration, potentially leading to dire consequences.
790	6769	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. At first the cyclist thought that the journey he was about to go on was going to be a good one, but that soon changes as the challenging terrain and misleading advice take their toll. For example, ìNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who havenít left the confines of their porched since Carter was in office.î This quote tells how at first the cyclist thought his journey was going to be a good one, but getting information from two old men soon changed that when their directions led him astray and into difficult conditions. The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the essay ìRough Road ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î highlighting how external elements can drastically alter one's expectations and experience.
791	6770	3	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist in that a desert-like temperature and the terrain on which he must bike make him more prone to thirst and exhausting. The heat during July will cause the cyclist to dehydrate faster than normal. This is especially true in this case because of his lack of water. The cyclist might pass out or suffer a heat stroke. The terrain of rolling hills will tire out the cyclist quicker than if he were still on the flat road. His muscles will start to ache and his body will need water and rest. The story would totally change if the setting were different. If the cyclist were biking in the winter on a cold day in the mid 30s he would not have a chance of suffering a heatstroke. There would be a significantly less chance of him becoming dehydrated. The setting is very important in every story and can change everything.
792	6771	3	3	In Joe Kurmaskie’s essay “Rough Road Ahead,” the speaker is biking through rough terrain in blistering heat, not to mention long distances. He has to ride up and down small and large hills through what he believes is a shortcut to his destination. He has a limited water supply, and he keeps coming across ghost towns, where the only water is boiling, brackish water that is unfit for human consumption. Probably the worst setting feature for this guy was the Welch’s Grape Juice Factory (abandoned of course). Adding salt to the wound was “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen” (Kurmaskie). To the narrator with his dwindling water supply, this billboard was especially daunting to him on his journey, serving as a cruel reminder of what he lacked and the harshness of his present situation. The image, in its faded glory, mocks his thirst and emphasizes the desolate nature of his surroundings, ultimately highlighting the physical and psychological challenges of his arduous ride.
793	6772	3	3	"Desert, hills, road condition, and lack of water all affected the cyclist's journey. First, the cyclist reveals he is in the desert when he exclaims, ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" This means it was hot, adding to the physical strain. Second, the hills and road conditions were horrible. The cyclist reveals this when he describes, ""flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,"" and again, ""Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit."" This made the ride more physically demanding and slower. Lastly, he had thought that he would have stops on the way to get water from, so he drank all the water he wanted. He then figured out he needed to conserve it, but by then it was too late. These examples show that the cyclist's conditions were harder than he expected them to be, turning what he thought would be a simple ride into a grueling challenge."
794	6773	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The winding road could affect his turns because he could turn too far one way and fall off his bike and get hurt real bad. The road’s condition, whether smooth or bumpy, also plays a role in maintaining balance. Another feature that could affect the cyclist is grass on both sides of the road. If he tries to take a short-cut and goes into the grass he could hit a rock and flip off his bike and get hurt. Therefore, the cyclist's safety and performance are significantly influenced by the surrounding environment. That is what the feature of the setting could affect the cyclist.
795	6774	3	3	"The cyclist was in a California desert in the middle of June. He thinks he's going to die towards the end because of the directions he got. ""Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office."" This means to never take directions from people who haven't been to the place for a while, especially when your life depends on accurate information in the unforgiving heat."
796	6775	3	3	The setting was a hot desert in California that a biker got stuck in going to Yosemite National Park. These settings were hard on the cyclist. For example, he listened to some old people who led him the wrong way and could have had him killed. He was running out of water and his legs felt like they were going to break off from the constant pedaling under the scorching sun. All of these troubles did affect his trust in old locals though. He learn that just because they are old and looks wise they don't necessarily have accurate information, probably older than the artifacts at a museum. Besides he has a trust map now, understanding who to rely on and who to question. He got a lot from this trip, especially the hard-earned lesson that wisdom isn't always tied to age and appearances, shaping a more discerning approach to advice in the future.
797	6776	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in ""ghost towns,"" there is no one to ask directions from or to just talk to, creating a sense of isolation. Also, some pumped water from water pumps tastes like ""battery acid"" and could most likely make someone sick, posing a threat to their health and hydration. Furthermore, there are poisonous snakes and other dangerous animals that could attack the cyclist, so the cyclist needs to be alert. Thus, the environmental aspects of the setting create significant challenges for the cyclist."
798	6777	3	3	"There are many features in the story that affect the roles, like being out of water and receiving bad directions. The narrator, whose name we don't know, says, ""the water bottles container a few tantalizing sips..."" implying there is hardly any water left. He still has to keep going on, until he can find some. In the story, water is something he has to overcome because he is out of it by the time he gets to the fish store, creating a significant obstacle in his journey. This lack of water highlights the desperation and perseverance he must exhibit."
799	6778	3	3	In this analysis I will explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the short story ìRough Road A Head Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î The whole ordeal occurs in the ìhigh deserts of california.î Prior to this, according to the text the cyclist had taken ìout of dateî directions from elderly people who thought they knew the way. The cyclist encountered a snake, ghost town, and shutdown factory, further highlighting the desolation. Most of the time the cyclist was going over rough terrain, adding to the challenge and isolation. This combination of outdated information and harsh, desolate environments significantly contributed to the cyclist's struggles and feeling of being lost and alone.
800	6779	3	3	The setting in ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî adds drama into the story by how it affects the cyclist. He was tacking through the ìhigh desert of California in Juneî. June is a hot part of the year and since he was in the hottest desert part the heat was multiplied. The terrain changing into ìshort rolling hillsî didnít help the cyclist. The hills would make any riding more difficult. Anyone who rides a bicycle knows it takes more effort to go up a hill than on flat pavement, draining the cyclist's energy. With the person's lack of water, anyone would be struggling to keep riding. Most people didnít have that hints to keep moving. He didnít set a very goal he just went to the ìnext Horizonî. Shouldnít he just wanted to keep going. Another problem with the physical environment was the road conditions. When the ìRough Road Affectî sign appeared the travel then became more difficult. A bike tire takes more effort to go over uneven pavement, which is why the cyclist had so much trouble, further escalating the challenges and heightening the story's tension.
801	6780	3	3	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affected the cyclist in a hard way. With only a few sips of water left, he noticed an abandoned building: ""abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it, it had been a Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand-blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head."" Having so little water, seeing that image would have only increased his thirst. Another way the setting affected the cyclist negatively was: ""The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel."" This reminded him that he was not in a car, and that he wasn't even going half the speed limit. The setting, therefore, affects the cyclist by constantly reminding him of the length of his journey, and at this point, he is clearly suffering from the harsh environment."
802	6781	3	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting the cyclist is in effects him greatly. One evening when he was resting he got into a deep conversation with a couple of elders. Eventually they got to talking about his journey, and the two men gave him direction for a shortcut. “But on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” When he arrives at the first town, he finds it deserted, this effects the cyclist because he is eventually going to need more water. As he continues, he comes to a steep incline in the road. “After I had arrested the first few of these a large highway sign jumped out at most read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” This sign was indicating that the road was going to be bumpy, which makes it even more challenging for the cyclist. So, the setting is very important in this essay because it has a lot to do with how the cyclist feels. When the abandoned towns come into play, he begins to feel hopeless. When the road gets bumpy, he gets tired. When he gets to an actual running store, he’s relieved, showcasing how the environment directly shapes his emotional and physical state throughout his journey.
803	6782	3	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because the feature is just a brief preview of what the text is going to be about or who is involved in it. The cyclist gives you what you want and need to know, so the affect would be about the time the feature is finished playing, and no one would want to see the cyclist. Essentially, the setting preview can overshadow the actual cyclist, leading to disinterest.
804	6783	3	3	"In the story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting of a story is the background, place, and time the story took place. In the story, a cyclist needs to get to @CAPS1 Park. He stops and gets direction from a group of old men, who arenít up with the times, and the cyclist gets lost. He faces drought, a snake, and being lost in the desert, the cyclist says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake ñ it really did look like a diamond back ñ blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, to avoid any confrontation."" The desert environment, with its lack of water and dangerous wildlife, directly impacts his journey and creates obstacles for him. The challenging desert setting significantly shapes the cyclist's experience and the difficulties he encounters."
805	6784	3	3	The cyclist chose the worst time to ride; it was an early summer evening in California. At this time, the sun is hot, and with little water and also lost, it was not the best choice that he made. A cyclist before doing a trip should be prepared for weather conditions and also check a map of the place before going anywhere. This simple preparation could have prevented his predicament, highlighting the importance of planning before embarking on a cycling journey.
806	6785	3	3	
807	6786	3	3	The features of this particular setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. Upon arriving at the ìghost townî early in his journey, he felt slight amusement at the situation. But he soon became very troubled when he became aware of the several rusty pumps and a weak corral, next to a ramshackle shed, hinting at a desolate past. The cyclist additionally experienced a bit of irony as he approached the 55 mph speed limit sign complete with a warning to strictly obey it. On his bicycle, at a pace of 12 mph, he could not even reach the 55 mph speed if he had wanted to, highlighting the absurdity of the warning in his context. Before he reached what appeared to be an abandoned Welchís Grape Juice factory, the cyclist felt this twisted amusement yet again, as he laughed. The text states, ìIt was a sad hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.î Finally, his suffering was through when he discovered a ìfish camp,î with a modern bathroom and working sinks, signifying a return to civilization. The cyclistís relief was so immense that he had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber (the owners), and kiss them, demonstrating the profound impact of simple comforts after such hardship.
808	6787	3	3	The setting of this story takes place with a man biking and then taking advice from old timers to a faster route. The biker knew from the start that he should have not given his map away. But thinking the old folks knew the route he took their advice. What the biker should have done was look for someone to ask and make sure the route would work with his journey. But jumping to where he wanted to go led him to dehydration and much more struggle than needed on the unexplored path. You should always think things out before you take action, just to be safe and prevent unnecessary complications.
809	6788	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he initially didn’t know where he was going and took directions from people he wasn’t really sure about. It was hot, and he was running out of water. He had no idea where he was, and there were snakes along the path, adding to his anxiety. His water was running out, and there were no signs to guide him. He kept thinking that he would never take directions from old guys again and that he would stick to future, more reliable methods of navigation, highlighting his frustration with the unfamiliar and challenging environment.
810	6789	3	3	At first when he gets the directions from the old men, he thinks he will be fine. When he gets to the first town he's tired and almost out of water, but still thinks he will be in Yosemite soon. When he gets to the water pump in the middle of the desert, he's tired and thirsty and he realizes that the directions the old men gave him were out of date. He's really not happy about listening to them and not following his map. When he gets to the fishing place he is grateful for the water in the sink and for the rest, and when the old man offers to give directions to Yosemite he thinks he will just use his map. Throughout the story the cyclist's needs change from feeling confident to feeling depressed to feeling relieved, showing his evolving understanding of the journey and the importance of relying on his own resources.
811	6790	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting seemed to affect the main character (the cyclist) very much during his pedal, for example, the dry desert setting made him think that he could survive without water, he became dehydrated. The first town, with @NUM1 degree water, could not satisfy his standards. The old Velches June factory was all run down and is no longer in business, much like the desert, just old, barren, unused land. This sense of decay and abandonment mirrored his own dwindling resources and perhaps his fading hope. While yes, the cyclist survived the pedal, the desert setting posed a great challenge for him, shaping his choices and pushing him to his physical limits.
812	6791	3	3	There are many features of the setting that effect the cyclist. One feature is that it is getting hotter and it will eventually effect him. The line ìI wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnít a mirge.î shows that the heat might be starting to effect him, impacting his vision and causing him discomfort. Another feature is that he is in the desert and running low on water. The line ìI had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularlyî shows that he is drinking a lot of water and is running low, which is dangerous in such an arid environment. Another feature is that he is riding in the high deserts of California in June. The story says ìand I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.î Not only is it in June, but it adds heat because he is also in a desert, creating a double whammy of intense heat. There is no doubt he will get dehydrated. Those are some of the many features that effect the cyclist, making his journey particularly challenging and risky.
813	6792	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it creates that deserted atmosphere and helps set the mood of the essay. The mood of the essay I think is a sort of dry summer day, the sort of “oh my gosh, it's really hot,” type thing. The setting is a dry summer day in June, with a deserted town, tumbleweeds, and the glaring sun contributing to the feeling of hopelessness. Although he was secured and didn't die, it seemed like he would surely not make it, judging by the lack of water, scorching hot sun, and the sheer distance he had to cover while enduring these conditions. So, the setting affects the cyclist in a way that realistically could have killed him, amplifying the sense of struggle and desperation.
814	6793	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the old guys had warned the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. So the features affect reading the story, as the faded sign ìDo not exceed Posted Speed Limitî was very dangerous and unsafe for people to ride on, especially with the cracked pavement and lack of a shoulder. The condition of the road significantly impacts the cyclist's journey.
815	6794	3	3	The setting effected the cyclist because it was bumpy and had a lot of hills which means he has to work harder. Also because of the heat he was getting dehydrated in the story; after the cyclist had been rideing a long time it says ìI eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state ì(kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist had very little water for his long trip, further compounding the challenges posed by the difficult terrain and high temperature. Therefore, the harsh environment significantly impacted the cyclist's physical state and performance.
816	6795	3	3	The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist I think is disgardment. First of all, a reason would be because at the beginning of the story when the warning sign is passed, the cyclist disgards it by going down the hill anyways. Also, it states that ìrode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.î This shows the cyclist's initial confidence leading to a disregard for potential danger, proving the setting's warning is ignored and ultimately shaping the cyclist's experience.
817	6796	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he went through many ups and downs, physically taxed by the terrain. At one point, he flowed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighbor of two hundred degrees, a geothermal manifestation. The weather wouldn't cool down, exacerbating the already challenging ride.
818	6797	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they caused him to need water. He was worn out because the setting was so intense. The rolling hills made the ride more physically demanding. ""Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" This quote from the text shows that the cyclists terrain was changing and they affected him. Therefore, the changing landscape directly contributed to the cyclist's fatigue and need for hydration."
819	6798	3	3	The features of the surrounding landscape affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. First, the sun constantly beating down on the cyclist causes his or her body to sweat more, which makes oneís body use more energy. The sun rays also add to the heat the cyclist feels, further contributing to dehydration. Also, the rough road forces the cyclist to pedal very hard, which drains him or her of even more energy. For example, when the cyclist in ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî reached the rough roads, he had to pedal harder, which made him sweat more, and caused his amount of energy to decrease. Finally, the lack of civilization can make a cyclist feel hopeless, which is how the cyclist in the essay felt when he had no water or could see no nearby town. This can affect the cyclistís will to keep pedaling, and if they have no determination, the cyclist will not go anywhere. Therefore, the features of the setting can physically exhaust and mentally strain the cyclist, which makes it harder for him or her to keep going.
820	6799	3	3	Snake, heat, hills-all are what the biker had to deal with because of certain settings. He had to deal with a diamond back slithering across the road. He was going through the desert so it was like 115 degrees. While he was biking he had to go up crippling hills that seemed to stretch on forever, testing his endurance.
821	6800	3	3	"The setting acts as a catalyst in this story. It is the aspect of the story that is always challenging the character until the very end. In the story it says ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is showing that the terrain is opposing him. Also in the story it says ""The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water depleted 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cool."" This is not only showing how much the elements are owning him, it also shows how resilient he is, and how satirical life can be. The ultimate challenge in this story is when he stumbles across the Welch's grape juice factory, and there was a picture of a boy ""pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth."" No matter where the cyclist goes, he is always trying to overcome the elements, illustrating how the environment persistently tests his endurance and spirit."
822	6801	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the lack of water begins to take a toll on how fast he can get to the next town, dehydrating him and sapping his energy. Another example would be the terrain only slows him down more, with steep inclines forcing him to walk his bike and rough roads increasing the risk of a flat tire. Ultimately, the harsh environment presents significant challenges to the cyclist's journey.
823	6802	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him use up the last of his water because itís hot, and than theres no one around because he's out in the deserts of California. ìI wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnít a mirageÖî (@NUM1.). This excerpt from the text supports my previous statement about how itís hot because the speaker tells us how heís sweating and that he might be seeing a mirage, which are common in scorching environments. ìThere was no one insight not a building, car, or any structure of any kindî (@NUM2.). This shows that there is no one around to help him if he falls down from a heat stroke or anything like that, emphasizing his vulnerability in this isolated and unforgiving place. So the setting is affecting the cyclist's endurance, pushing him to his physical limits due to the heat and isolation.
824	6803	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it more difficult to ride. ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î ìI could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.î ìa large highway sign jumped out atm.î ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit.î ìsometimes life can feel so cruel.î The fact that it was such a hot day made the ride seem longer, intensifying the physical challenges. When out of water, one feels exhausted and vulnerable. You will do just about anything to try to withstand the heat, further highlighting how the environment dictates the experience. Ultimately, the difficult terrain and oppressive heat combine to make the cyclist's journey a true test of endurance.
825	6804	3	3	Author Joe Kurmaskie learns the dangers of a lifeless wilderness during his experience described in ìdo not exceed posted speed limit.î As a cyclist riding in one of the most undeveloped areas in California, the lack of water found in this setting proves crippling to his survival. The trails he was directed to had no towns or sources of fresh, drinkable water for days, a critical oversight given the physical demands of his journey. The combination of constant exercise riding through the terrain, lack of water and resources, California summer weather, and lack of civilization drained the author’s energy and caused him to suffer from dehydration, a condition exacerbated by the relentless sun. Too much exposure to these conditions could have killed him. The modern time period and year also caused the directions the author was given to be inaccurate, and, thus, causing the cyclist to find himself in such a dangerous and isolated area of the country. The setting of ìdo not exceed posted speed limitî, therefore, places the cyclist in a life-threatening situation due to environmental challenges and inaccurate guidance.
826	6805	3	3	The features of a setting could be a number of different things. It could be snowing and cold, raining and of course wet, hot and dry, breezy and humid. The features could be a busy tough or a solitere country road, there could be rough terrain or straight aways. The setting of a place puts pressure of the reality of what will happen on a cyclist. In the essay a young cyclist takes advice from some elderly man and ends up riding through hot sun and ghost towns not knowing if he would survive. The heat had him feeling as though death were coming on him and the thirst had him becoming more determined to get to the next town so he could survive. If the features of the setting had been different, say he was riding on a flat road in a busy town with a breeze and places to stop for water everywhere he would not have feared for his life. The features of the setting affect how the cyclist feels and thinks. He can feel angry, happy, sad or scared and he can start to think about his own death. These have been what I believe some of the effects settings have on cyclist, influencing their emotions and shaping their mental state as they navigate the world.
827	6806	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when the author says “flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills,” that made the author have to ride safer, carefully pacing himself to conserve energy on the inclines and control his speed on the downhills. Also, when he says, “the ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement,” the author had to slow down on his bike and find a safe way around it so he could get past, cautiously maneuvering to avoid startling the creature or getting bitten. Finally when the author says “no one in sight, no building, car, or structure,” he is affected because he can’t ask questions since he's lost and he's thirsty, heightening his feelings of isolation and vulnerability. The setting makes it hard for the author to maneuver and get to where he wants to go, presenting obstacles that challenge his physical endurance and navigational skills.
828	6807	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the person who rode the bike was very tired; his legs and body needed a rest after riding on his bike for @NUM1 miles into the pedal. The wind's resistance and the uphill inclines of the terrain challenged his stamina. Also, it affected the cyclist because of all the riding he had to do, struggling to get where he was trying to get, but he was a strong man and he was willing to finish his forty miles of pedaling. He was also restless, but he did it, demonstrating his resolve despite the difficult conditions imposed by the setting.
829	6808	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in, ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î because it goes to many different terrains. The cyclist starts at a town and is working his way to Yosemite when he decides to listen to a group of old men. He started out strong until he got to the first town, which was totally abandoned with broken windows. He kept going to another abandoned town, equally desolate. He decided to keep going until he saw a sign warning of the rough road ahead. The terrain was a lot different with rolling hills and tumbleweed rolling by and a snake slithering across the road. Through listening to the old men, the cyclist almost died from the threatening heat and lack of water on the barren landscape. The setting affected the cyclist even more seriously than he could have imagined, pushing him to his physical and mental limits.
830	6809	3	3	In the story, the setting greatly affects the attitude of the cyclist. When he starts out, it is an early summer evening, he is serene while he is talking to the old men. He starts cycling the next morning and he is thinking of Yosemite, he is relaxed and confident; however, his attitude about the day changes greatly when he comes across the rumshackle old shed, rusty pumps, and a corral at the park in the road, signs of neglect that slightly unsettle him. He becomes a little worried but he is not discouraged. When the terrain changes, becoming more difficult, he is a little discouraged. Then, when he comes across the abandoned factory, a symbol of decay and failure, he is most definitely a lot discouraged. A little later he comes across @PERSON1’s Fish camp, a sign of civilization and potential help, he is very relieved and thankful to the owners. The cyclist’s attitude changed depending upon whether the setting was very beneficial to him or not, demonstrating the powerful influence of environment on mood and outlook.
831	6810	3	3	The features of the setting have a great affect on the desperate travels of the weary cyclist. The sometimes disappointing, sometimes uplifting, scenery he passes affect him physically and emotionally; when he passes a portion in the road with nothing but a “ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral,” he becomes disturbed. The cyclist is running low on water when he becomes even more distraught at a road with a speed limit posted as 55 mph, when he was, “doing a water-depleting @NUM1.” The setting of the hot, June sun affects the cyclist and puts him in a state of dehydration, exacerbating his physical distress. In an “ironic twist” the cyclist is affected emotionally when he passes a @ORGANIZATION1 factory that has been abandoned. The factory features a picture of a boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth which upsets the thirsty cyclist, highlighting the cruel contrast between his parched state and the image of refreshment. Thus, the cyclist's journey is deeply influenced by the environment, with each element contributing to his physical and emotional state.
832	6811	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist more than anything in the reading of “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speeding Limit.” In the beginining when the cyclists had just begun his cycling cause he uses a positive tone to describe the setting. For example, in paragraph four he says “the cool pines and running rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” When he says this the reader imagines someone in an optimistic mood, more excited as he anticipates reaching his destination on a dry day. As the cyclists attitude becomes lower the reader makes the connection what is happening then because of the setting. In paragraph thirteen when the cyclist says, “I wiped the swear from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage and that not to get too excited” the reader can make the connection that it is getting pretty serious for the cyclist to continue as is. Overall as the setting changes to “burning sun” and extremely hot, with a shortage of water the cyclist becomes more sarcastic and less upbeat. For example when taking about the rocks in his mouth he states “with only luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” This shows a bad mood affected by the features of the setting, demonstrating how the harsh environment significantly impacted his experience.
833	6812	3	3	"The rougher the road gets for him, the more determination he has at the beginning; towards the end, he had the mindset that ""it didn’t matter, it was going to die."" This took a toll on him, and it was hard to go on, physically and mentally draining him. He realized he didn’t want to die that way, alone and defeated, and so he kept on, pushing through the pain and despair, eventually leading to civilization and a chance at survival."
834	6813	3	3	The feature of the setting affect the biker a lot because the rough terrain is described, which implies that the biker probably had a hard time. Halfway through the story, he said, ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î He said this to describe the increasing difficulty in this race, suggesting the physical strain he endured. It also makes it seem exciting because it changes things around and introduces an element of unpredictability. It wouldnít be exciting if they said that flat roads turned into even flatter roads, or if they didnít show the terrain change at all, because the challenge and the biker's response to it are what create the narrative's tension and eventual payoff.
835	6814	3	3	Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.î an essay written by Joe Kurmaskie, is about a solo cyclist going on a journey to Yosemite National Park. So he listens to a group of old guys and ends up lost on rough road with no water, or relylittic supply of flat road was replaced by short rolling hills large highways lon jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.î The rough road made have to work harder want more water and just made things tougher more than what they already were. The sign became a stark reminder of the challenges ahead, both physically and mentally. The rough road, with its added strain, amplified the need for basic necessities like water. The difficulty of the path tested his resolve.
836	6815	3	3	The settings of your environment always seem to affect your mood. Take for instance the cyclist. In the beginning he had a positive attitude but once he arrived at the first town his attitude started to go down from there. He describes the town as maybe at one point being a thriving spot, “but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” Ghost towns come across very old, run down and dull, and the cyclist's spirits dampened as a result. That affected the cyclist because by it not being like the old men said, he was becoming doubtful, which in turn doesn’t give you the same motivation as when he started. Then when he gets to what is supposed to be water, a “tar like substance oozed out.” That makes him nervous and mad because he isn’t sure he will make it, feeling the harshness of the landscape. But his attitude changes as soon as he sees the store, a sign of civilization and hope. The setting becomes positive and so does he, reinvigorated by the prospect of supplies and human contact. So, the setting does effect the cyclist's mood and attitude, demonstrating how our surroundings can significantly shape our emotional state and determination.
837	6816	3	3	"Many of the setting's features affect the cyclist. One of the features of the desert-like setting is the dry air and hot temperatures. This heat made it hard for the cyclist to keep going; with despair, the author says, ""I was going to die, and the birds would pick me clean."" Another feature of the setting was the desolate towns that didn’t contain any water. This lack of water made it horrible for him to continue on. The thirst was so bad that he had to put pebbles in his mouth; sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. Another feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the abandoned Welch’s Grape factory. This factory gave the cyclist false hope because it would have been so great to have some grape juice during his thirst-stricken state. The narrator called the factory ""ironic twist."" Therefore, the harsh environment of the desert, with its heat, lack of water, and taunting reminders of refreshment, significantly hindered the cyclist's journey."
838	6817	3	3	"The effects from the setting that has an effect on me is that while riding on the bike in hot weather with only a little bit of water to drink because I would have given up having nothing to drink. The water had to be hot. In the text it says, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,"" I don’t think I could have lasted long if I was dehydrated and exerting myself. From the look of it I would have drop dead of heatstroke, considering the lack of water and the intense heat described. Ultimately, the combination of dehydration and heat would have made the situation unbearable."
839	6818	3	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance, in the story, ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî the lack of water in the dry desert gave a long lasting affect on the cyclist. ìWide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadnít been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.î This shows the reader how all the heat and shortage of water has made the cyclist feel very hot and dehydrated and that she could pass out any second. She is also thinking beyond that by just laughing at herself and trying to conserve every bit of energy she possibly can. The harsh environment, with its relentless sun and arid landscape, has pushed her to her physical and mental limits, forcing her to confront her own vulnerability and resilience. As a result, the affect from the setting on the cyclist is that lack of water has given her humor and courage to keep going, to get to her final destination point. Ultimately, it is the challenging desert environment that forges an unexpected strength and resolve within the cyclist, enabling her to persevere despite the odds.
840	6819	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The bumpy roads made his journey arduous. Sand in the eyes stung with each gust, and thirst hit him hard under the hot and humid temperatures. Maybe he got tired of pedaling and had to walk for a while, pushing the bike. A wild dog chased him when he got in town, adding to his stress. He had no money to buy a drink, leaving him parched and longing for relief. These factors show how the environment presented various challenges for the cyclist.
841	6820	3	3	The cyclist of this story is greatly affected by the heat of his souroundings. While he riding to @CAPS1, the heat of the day began to increase. The text reads ì I had been hitting my water bootle regulary. ì Due @CAPS2 to the heat of the day, the cyclist was down to his water consuming large patterns of it at a time. He was definitely feeling the impact of the sun and the rising temperature on his ride.
842	6821	3	3	When the cyclist mentions how hot and dry and open the terrain is, it makes me feel like he is in the desert. The sun beats down relentlessly on the barren landscape. I also know that it's hot because he is sweating and dehydrated, desperately seeking shade from the scorching heat. This combination of factors reinforces the impression of a harsh, arid environment.
843	6822	3	3	"At first the cyclist feels fine, he gets a little bit discouraged, but basically heís fine. ìThe cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over themî (@CAPS1). He feels relaxed, because he is at home with the water and the pine trees. They give him a sense of comfort. He thinks that after the first ""tree"" not being that much of anything, the others will be better. He knows that he has it in him to make it, but he doesnít know yet that he will have to travel a long way to get water. When he sees the sign, ìIt read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.î he knows that things are going to get rough, because ìthe speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mphî. He anticipates the challenging terrain ahead, his slower pace a stark contrast to the implied speed, hinting at a difficult journey. At that point he starts to get worried, because he is out there more alone, and he realizes that he doesnít have water. As he runs out of water, the landscape, and his surroundings, start to get drier and drier. He states, ìtumble weeds crossed my path.î The landscape seems to get more threatening too, ìa ridiculously large shake.î The landscape changes with the state of water, mirroring his increasing desperation and the growing severity of his situation."
844	6823	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because the heat and no humanity makes him so crazy. If he was in a place like Phoenix, Arizona. It would be just the heat because there are people everywhere in Phoenix, Arizona. If he was in Antarctica it would be the severe temperature drop and no humanity and he would probably die. Therefore, the environment plays a crucial role in the cyclist's mental and physical state.
845	6824	3	3	The features of the setting that the cyclist runs into do affect him. For example, when the setting changes from an abandoned town to an empty, deserted road that has not been used in thirty years, this stark isolation gives a cyclist less motivation to continue and even less strength, as the desolation saps his will.
846	6825	3	3	Joe Kurmaskieís ìRough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî tells how a cyclist takes directions from older men who donít tell him correctly the way to get to Yosemite, so the cyclist ends up lost with hardly any water. Features of the setting such as the terrain and the sun affect the cyclist in the story. The sun was very hot on a summer's day and without water makes it even difficult to keep moving because he was so hot and thirsty. Kurmaskie writes, ìThe sun was beginning to beat downÖ I was traveling through the high deserts of California in Juneî. The terrain was also bumpy and rough to travel on, further adding to the physical strain. The relentless sun and the unforgiving terrain significantly impacted the cyclist, exacerbating the challenges of his already difficult journey, making his quest to reach Yosemite all the more arduous.
847	6826	3	3	The features of the setting taunt the cyclist with cruel irony. As the cyclist continues down his path he passes through a ghost town, the silence amplifying his solitude, then twenty miles up the road he sees a ramshackle shed and some rusty water pumps. He attempts to get water out because he was running out, his hopes rising momentarily, but all he could get was muck, then what he described as “water feeling two-hundred degrees; it had the flavor of battery acid.” Further down the road was a sign that said rough road ahead, adhere to the posted speed limit of 55; he was going 12 mph, each rotation of the pedals a struggle. Even worse, he found an abandoned juice factory on the way, the faded signs a cruel reminder of refreshment he couldn't have; at that point, he was completely out of water, his thirst a constant, gnawing companion. The landscape seemed to mock his efforts, presenting the illusion of aid while offering only further hardship, highlighting the futility of his journey.
848	6827	3	3	Do not exceed the posted speed limit, and never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in the office. Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork as sorrows mounted. I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength to try and get some refreshment. The water bottles contained only a few total sips. He could have been a sad person, judging by his demeanor. And he could just be a bum, though I hesitate to judge.
849	6828	3	3	The features of the setting could affect this cyclist. In this case it do effect the cyclist. According to the text ìSometimes life can feel so cruel.î This is a good example because he knew that this road was going to be rough and he was only going 12 mph. So the features of the setting did effect the cyclist, slowing him down and making his journey more difficult. Therefore, the environment undeniably impacted his speed and experience.
850	6829	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist very much in this. The hot weather made him have a dry mouth leading to the lack of water. He used stones in his mouth and he said, ìIíd read once that sucking of stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate."" He used that to help him survive the ordeal, finding a small, if unconventional, way to cope with the aridity and the intense physical demands of cycling in such conditions, ultimately showcasing his resourcefulness."
851	6830	3	3	"The features affected the cyclist in many ways, one being the highway sign, ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT."" The terrain was now short, rolling hills, which would make it harder on the cyclist to pedal up the hills, for it would take a lot more effort and energy. Also, there were roadblocks, at some point, tumbleweeds blocked my path and a ridiculously large snake. These roadblocks would danger the biker, for he'd have to maneuver around them, losing time and energy, resulting in drinking more water. No water is a great danger for it was June, a hot day and he is risking getting dehydrated, potentially leading to heatstroke. There was also nobody around, so if he desperately needed water he couldn't obtain any, further compounding the risks he faced on this challenging ride."
852	6831	3	3	"After reading “Do Not Exceed Posted Limit” I have seen how the scene of an area can affect your mood and attitude around things. In this story, the main character is a cyclist who takes the advice of a few old men sitting in a posada who tell him a bad shortcut. As he is riding, he comes across some hills. Those hills really affected him physically; he gets tired from peddling up and down continually. ""That mood"" was replaced by short, moving hills. The cyclist could not exert energy; he tried everything, not knowing how long he'd have to continue going up and down. There, at one point he says, ""Roads can feel so cruel."" There, he is upset because a road sign came up through such tough roads and told him not to exceed 55 miles per hour when he was barely going 12 miles per hour. This can be viewed as metaphorical also. When you take a shortcut in life, there are always consequences, as when you decide to drop out of high school to go on with your journal, where there is always the possibility of it not working, and where you cry with no diploma and then get a job. In essence, the cyclist's frustrating experience mirrors the potential pitfalls of taking shortcuts in life, where the immediate ease can lead to unexpected hardship and a stark realization of the trade-offs involved."
853	6832	3	3	"In the short story, ""Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting effects the cyclist in the story. For example, the dry hot air begins to slowly dehydrate him, causing the cyclist to lose all sense of reason, the heat also played tricks on his mind. He begins to see things that are not there and misinterpret the road signs. Also, the rolling hills exhausted him from working to cycle up them. This, also with the heat factor, caused him to use up his much needed water supply far too quickly, leaving him in a desperate situation. The setting in this story deeply effects the cyclist."
854	6833	3	3	Features from the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The area in he was in had a major affect. He was in Cali, which is a big desert. In the middle of some parts, it is very hot. Bike riding on roads in the desert with no trees or shade of any sort is quite harsh. The sun beats down relentlessly, and the heat radiating from the asphalt adds to the challenge. And to be riding around where there is not much civilization as to where you can't get water is a major issue. Dehydration becomes a serious threat in such an isolated environment, making proper hydration planning essential for survival. Therefore, the cyclist's experience is profoundly shaped by the unforgiving desert landscape.
855	6834	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, because there is a poisonous snake out there. You’re the only person riding down those hills all by yourself. The guy had said that the next town was @NUM1 miles from where he was at. The lack of water, with no streams or rivers around, just a desert with nothing, only compounded his struggle. This isolation and harsh environment made the journey even more perilous.
856	6835	3	3	The setting is mid summer in California in the desert. It is hot, humid and very dry. There is a lack of water in his bag. He is on a trip, going down the lost, rough and rigorous roads. The sun beats down mercilessly, the air shimmering with heat haze. Each mile stretches on, the cracked earth offering no respite. The scant water remaining sloshes uselessly, barely enough to wet his parched throat. The journey continues, a test of endurance against the harsh landscape.
857	6836	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because it was a hot June day in a desert in California. For example, you're in the desert cycling for many hours, it's very hot, and you only have limited water. This affects the cyclist because you have to conserve the water that you have to be able to make it to the park. Another example is that you are going up and down rolling hills, and your legs get very tired, so they don't want to move any more. And the best example is the sun is beating down on you, and you're sweating so much and you might be seeing things, but all you want to do is see something that has water. These are all things that affected the cyclist very much, showcasing how the harsh desert environment significantly impacted their physical and mental endurance throughout the journey.
858	6837	3	3	The cyclist in the story is running into a lot of problems. For example, the cyclist is out in the summer heat in California riding a bike. After several minutes of this, you will become thirsty. The cyclist brought water but after constant sweating the water supply has nearly ran out. Not having enough water can cause a person to become dehydrated, which then can cause them to pass out and possibly die. These are all dangerous effects of prolonged exposure in the heat. So as you can see, the cyclist is affected by the setting in the story, facing tangible risks. He has been affected negatively by the heat and by the lack of water, demonstrating how the environment poses a significant challenge.
859	6838	3	3	There are many ways that the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For example the cyclist was in a very hot and dry place. Meaning there was no water any where to be seen in miles. Also towns were nowhere to be seen for it would be hard to substain life out there. This quote supports there werenít many towns, ''About forty miles into the pedal I arrived at the first town.'' This shows there aren't many towns in these parts, so hot and thirsty as the text claims, ''I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst '' this clearly shows the man was very thirsty. Also shows the man was very thirsty. Also so hot out there the man could see visions as the text states, ''As the looks ofter had been a grape juice factory and bottling plant.'' why would there be a grape juice factory in the middle of no where. Therefore these statements above show how settings can affect ones mind and physical conditions to the cyclist, demonstrating the powerful influence of a harsh environment on both perception and well-being.
860	6839	3	3	The setting that affects the cyclist is the condition of the road because the road turns all different ways, and the road goes uphill, so it makes it harder to go up the road. The cyclist has @NUM1 miles before he gets to a town; he could run out of water. If he runs out of water before he gets there, he might have to make stops so he doesn't make himself sick from dehydration. When he gets to the town, he can get more water, ensuring he can safely continue his journey.
861	6840	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making him hot and thirsty most of his way. As he rode, he started to get tired slowly, and he got worn and more thirsty. He drank his water at first without thinking too much of it, but as he went on, he slowly found himself trying to conserve it. By the time he got to the second wild town, he was so thirsty and tired that he thought it might have been a ""death."" So he wiped the sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, a vision often caused by extreme heat and dehydration. The only time people see mirages is when they are hot, tired, and about to kill for some water. This is what the cyclist was like after his long journey to Yosemite National Park with the directions given by old men, highlighting just how challenging the environment had become for him."
862	6841	3	3	The features of the setting include there being no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind which describes the trail the cyclist was taking. These features of the setting describe how the cyclist is affected because it elaborates on his doubting whether he will survive or not, amplifying his feelings of isolation and vulnerability as he faces the daunting prospect of being utterly alone should something go wrong.
863	6842	3	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. The speed limit sign makes him feel like life is cruel. His first glimpse of the Welch's Juice factory makes him feel excited. Meeting the deserted fork in the road makes him feel troubled. When he finally gets there, he feels relieved. These are all examples showing that features of the setting affected the cyclist, demonstrating how external environments can significantly influence inner emotions.
864	6843	3	3	The many features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist & his performance. For example, the cyclist is riding through a very hot area of California. This is said at the end of paragraph @NUM1: ,ìand I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.î The high deserts of California are windy, sandy, dry, and hot. Not something that someone should be cycling on, had the setting, told of the mountianous regions of California, the wither would hot be hot, or tired because the mountians are a cool, although dry place. Had I had been cycling, I would rather have cycled in a different setting, such as mountians, than an arid desert. that way I would not have to endure the discomfort a cyclist expearenced. The harsh conditions of the desert, with its heat and dryness, would undoubtedly make cycling more challenging and impact performance negatively, while the cooler temperatures and varying altitudes of the mountains could offer a more favorable environment. Therefore, the cyclist's experience is significantly shaped by the specific characteristics of the Californian desert setting.
865	6844	3	3	The features setting in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” are very important to the cyclist. In this story, the setting really affected the cyclist because it was in California which is a really hot place during the summer. The cyclist had problems because of the weather and on the shortness of water. Since there was a shortness of water he had to conserve it which slowed him down because he couldn’t ride as much. Although there was a cool wind and a river from Yosemite he had to pass quickly down the hill so he had even more problems. This is why the settings of the story really affected the cyclist and how much he could ride, ultimately influencing his journey and challenges faced.
866	6845	3	3	"In the story ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting significantly affects the cyclist. The narrative recounts the man pedaling long distances, twenty miles here and forty miles there, under the intense heat with a limited water supply, leading to doubts about reaching his destination. The narrator states, ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,"" highlighting the extreme heat. The desert's hot weather limited his water supply, and the desolation of the location, devoid of buildings, diminished his hope. The presence of snakes further endangered him, and the rough road made his journey more challenging. ""I began breaking the ride into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself if I could make it to that I'd be fine."" This quote illustrates his struggle due to the harsh environment but also his resilience. Ultimately, the features of the setting profoundly impact the cyclist, shaping his experience and testing his endurance in the face of adversity."
867	6846	3	3	Many features of the cyclistís surroundings affect his speed and confidence. He was the only one on the road. There were no other cars, bikes, motorcycles, or even buildings nearby. It's like he's in the countryside. So that makes him want to go faster, because he wonít hit anything. The wide, open road stretches before him, clear and inviting. The fact that he's alone in the wide, open spaces boosts up his energy level and makes him feel more confident, allowing him to push his limits.
868	6847	3	3	To be able to have a good bike ride, you must have a good setting. To me, a good setting would about @NUM1∞ outside and sunny. You can't go bike riding in snow because there is no way that the tires will move in the snow. You can't go in rain or hail because the roads get slippery and you could get in a accident that could injure or kill you. If it is sunny outside you be able to ride freely on dry roads with a little breeze to go through your hair and you could be refreshed. The sun also provides good visibility. That is why I believe it is important for the setting to be just right for a bike ride.
869	6848	3	3	"The June sun beat down mercilessly on the cyclist as he navigated the seemingly endless desert. The hotter it got, the more precious water he consumed, a constant worry since he was utterly alone. After what felt like an eternity, ""about forty miles in the pedal I arrived as my first 'town'. The place might have been a thriving little oasis at one time."" The deserted streets confirmed his isolation; there was nobody to offer water, directions, or any kind of assistance, highlighting the stark reality of his solitary journey. Every mile pedaled was a testament to his determination in the face of such desolation, a fight for survival fueled by the hope of reaching the National Park."
870	6849	3	3	In the essay, ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting greatly affected the cyclist. In this story, the cyclist is heading for Yosemite National Park, thinking it wise, he accepts directions from a group of eccentric old men. He begins his journey confidently on flat terrain and with a large supply of water. The first of three promised towns had been resigned to that of a ghost town, a desolate scene that dashed initial hopes. The second offered only water that slightly resembled battery acid, a further blow to his dwindling resources. The cyclist soon becomes exhausted from lack of water and having to cross the now hilly terrain. He barely makes it to the third town to realize that the juice factory was out of business, a final strike against his expectations. The cyclist becomes sure that he is going to die of lack of water when he stumbles across a bait store, his last hope in a desperate situation. If it hadnít been so hot, if the ìtownsî along the way had offered better resources and if the terrain hadnít been so hilly, the cyclist would have had a very enjoyable ride. All of the aforementioned factors of the setting greatly affected the cyclist, shaping his arduous journey and near-death experience.
871	6850	3	3	Hot, terrain, middle of nowhere- all are features of the setting that affected the cyclist. First, the hot weather in California made the cyclist thirsty and almost dehydrated, sapping his energy with each passing mile. There was no place to stop for water and if there was, the water was bad and warm, offering little relief. Second, the different types of terrain made the cyclist really thirsty also and tired; steep inclines tested his strength, while rough patches jarred his body. Lastly, the cyclist was in the middle of nowhere, completely isolated from civilization. He couldnít get water to hydrate himself or a shaded spot to sit down and rest, compounding the challenges he faced. The unforgiving environment, therefore, presented multiple obstacles that tested the cyclist's endurance.
872	6851	3	3	The setting for the cyclist is a hard and dangerous one. He had little water, and his area had tough terrains. ìI was travelling through the high deserts of California in Juneî (@NUM1). He is dehydrated and he still has a long way to go. I went on a bike ride that was many miles long in @LOCATION2, and we did not have water because we could not take a break. The terrain was tough, just like the authorís terrain. The heat was intense. The camel he was in was affecting his brain, and he just wanted to get it over with. I am just glad I donít have to bike in that terrain.
873	6852	3	3	The cyclist in ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1î was riding through the California desert in June. This dry, bare setting made it impossible to find any source of water. The only time that this cyclist found water was when it rained @NUM1 and tasted of battery acid. There was nowhere for him to find water for miles. This lack of water and scorching heat made him travel slow and wearily. He even says that he could only go 12 mph in a 55 mph zone. By taking the advice of the old men and taking a ìshort cutî, the cyclist passed through ghost towns with no water. This ìshort cutî prolonged his trip, most likely by hours. If he had gone through populated areas, despite the fact that it is a longer path, there would have been more water to drink, which would allow him to go faster. The dry, hot setting of the old menís ìshort cutî made this cyclistís trip last much longer than necessary, highlighting how the promise of a shortcut can sometimes lead to unexpected and detrimental consequences.
874	6853	3	3	When the man began cycling he thought that this was going to be an easy ride. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says ìThings began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.î As he got further he realized that he was in the middle of nowhere. The scenery was getting more and more empty and desolate. There was eventually nothing but sand and scrub. The scenery was putting down his hope of ever getting out of the desert. For example: In paragraph @NUM2 it states, ìa large highway sign jumped out of me. It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.î He realized this was going to be hard. He had to travel on bumpy roads and pass snakes without getting bit, and the sun beat down relentlessly. The scenery created a sense of hopelessness because it was abandoned and unforgiving. When he saw the bait shop, his spirits lifted and he was now hopeful and relieved, seeing a sign of civilization after such a trying journey.
875	6854	3	3	"When the cyclist began his journey he was confident in succeeding. Throughout the story however, the cyclist endures many conflicts to his success in his journey. The cyclist faced his first difficulty once he reached a small, abandoned town. ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June"" (kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist realized he had not conserved his water and his ""water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips"" (kurmaskie @NUM1). On top of his water problem the heat was unbelievable, and he felt the sun beating down relentlessly. He was losing hydration from all the sweat, and he was losing it quickly. The cyclist was also dealing with the difficult roads, full of uneven terrain that made each mile a struggle. There were many things this cyclist endured throughout his journey, but he was determined to finish his trip and was filled with satisfaction once he overcame these hardships."
876	6855	3	3	The features of the setting put an affect on the cyclist. The first thing would be listening to old men who seemed like they had no idea how far, long, or the condition of the roads where they were sending him, their advice proving unreliable. Another thing that affected him would be the road condition, where there were tumbleweeds obstructing his path, and a ridiculously large snake slithering across, creating hazards. The second thing that came into play would be the hot weather which made dehydration come into play, sapping his strength. These environmental factors significantly impacted the cyclist's journey.
877	6856	3	3	One main feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the heat of the day. If you ride a bike in the heat of the day, you are going to use up a lot of water to keep yourself hydrated. Another factor is the limited supply of water the cyclist is carrying, which makes rationing crucial. The final factor is the wrong directions from the aged men they encounter along the way. Aged people aren’t always wrong, but their information can be out of date due to changes in the landscape or routes over time. Therefore, the cyclist must carefully consider all the environmental and informational challenges they face to ensure a safe journey.
878	6857	3	3	The features of the setting in the essay affect the cyclist because as he was riding his bike throughout California, he entered hot deserts and was almost out of water. The cyclist was in a very bad dehydrated state as he was riding his bike, looking for water or anything drinkable that would successfully get rid of his dehydration. The relentless sun and arid landscape exacerbated his thirst. After a little while, the cyclist found himself alone in the desert with no one in sight. An example of this would be ìThere was no one in sight,not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Another example to show how the cyclist was struggling and fighting against dehydration is ìwise rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june simply because i listened to some gentlemen who hadenít been off their porch in decades shown how the settings of this essay affected the cyclist greatly. The harsh environment pushed him to his physical and mental limits, highlighting how the desert setting directly threatened his well-being.
879	6858	3	3	"During the author's ride to Yosemite, he doesn't have the proper tools – by tools I mean water – to go along the long stretch of desert he was to face. The California desert is extremely hot and can be potentially dangerous depending on your situation; the author was describing how the lack of water was affecting him. He described this with sentences like ""Rattled around the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain."" The author clearly cannot face the rugged heat with his immense lack of water, as his body and mind were beginning to suffer the consequences of dehydration. The author was getting beat, stroke being passed by @LOCATION2 desert snakes and tumbleweeds. The author was clearly in a struggle against the @LOCATION2 desert heat, making his journey a true test of endurance and resourcefulness, where survival was becoming increasingly uncertain."
880	6859	3	3	The settings and features are very important to cyclists one because water and food try might carry a waterbottle and a snack but they need to know where they are going and if they will need to bring extra or not. In the story I just read he didnít bring enough to last him so he got some directions but they were bad so he was in trouble. It's important that a cyclist knows where their going and what's around them so they don't get lost and have no access to food or water. This highlights how crucial proper planning and reliable navigation are for cyclists to ensure they have sufficient supplies and avoid potentially dangerous situations.
881	6860	3	3	"The features of setting effected the cyclist because he was in a desert in the month of June which was really hot and dry. There were also no trees around so there was no shade for him to relax in, so the sun was also beating on his back. There was also lots of hills that took his strength to jump, for example it says ""over one long, crippling hill."" There was also a big crazy twist in his way. He even saw a snake slithering across the path, adding to the stress. All of these things made him really tired; for example, he didn't have much water and the sun was making him hot and dehydrated. There was no shade so he had to just take the sun beating down on his back. He had to jump over hills so that took a lot of energy. He had to ride up one long hill so that also made him tired. All of these environmental challenges combined, happening back to back without giving him a break, significantly contributed to his exhaustion."
882	6861	3	3	In the story it explained the beauty of the night, also about the outdoors and how it is effecting his trip. The features of the setting effects the cyclist, because the setting was mild, sounded warm and calm. Also it showed how it contains to us. The setting was similar to the cyclist, perhaps reflecting his own inner peace and resilience as he journeys. That's how the features of the setting effects the cyclist.
883	6862	3	3	The cyclist was in California in June; the sun was beating down on him, making the ride difficult with a short water supply. The man came upon several towns that were abandoned, which further strained his dwindling water supply. The terrain was long and straight, then turned into tall hills, adding to the challenge of the already arduous ride.
884	6863	3	3	"How the features of the setting affects the cyclist is the condition of the roads, rolling hill, and the heat. The conditions of the road in the settings affect the cyclist because the roads are rough. An example from the text is ""I noticed that terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills."" These conditions make it hard for the cyclist; it gives him a challenge. The rolling hills challenge him and require him to stay focused on the road; it is easily tricky and challenging. The heat and sun also played an affection on the cyclist. An example from the text is: ""I chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was beginning to heat up, but I barely noticed."" Soon, the sun was starting to get to him sharply. It will start to get worse when he is in the high deserts. I conclude that these features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways, but he kept pushing himself to move on."
885	6864	3	3	"In the setting of Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, is riding a bike really fast on a rough road, therefore, a violation? The inherent danger of such an action, even if the speedometer on a car isn't involved, suggests a disregard for safety. The ""posted speed limit"" implicitly aims to ensure the safety of all road users, not just those in vehicles. Therefore, riding a bike recklessly fast on a rough road, jeopardizing the rider and potentially others, arguably defies the spirit, if not the letter, of that limit, highlighting the importance of responsible road behavior for all."
886	6865	3	3	The cyclist had a couple of affects in his journey. One of them was the hills; it was a problem because it used most of his energy and slowed him down considerably. The other one was water, the lack of water. If he had enough water he would have gotten a boost that would have kept him going, thus proving crucial for maintaining his pace and stamina.
887	6866	3	3	In the essay, ìRough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limitî, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Firstly, the cyclist had been pedaling through the ìhigh deserts of Californiaî, making a hint that the temperature was hot and dry, and therefore he mustíve been getting thirsty regularly and exhausted from the sun beating down on him. The relentless sun would have also quickly evaporated any sweat, leading to dehydration. Second, he began to ride through hills, and as common sense would be used, hills are much harder to ride on a bicycle especially up hill, and it wears you down. These hills, along with a lack of water mustíve tired him out and given him extreme difficulty to make it without much water. As you can tell, the difference in setting plays itís crucial part on the cyclist and his precious water supply.
888	6867	3	3	"The setting affects the cyclist because he cannot take the heat. His water supply is running low and he is dehydrated. This is evident when the character says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide wings of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke."" This is saying he is afraid he might pass out and die before he finds more water, emphasizing the perilous impact of the harsh environment on his physical state."
889	6868	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first place he arrived at was a ìghost town.î Then he reached a water pump about twenty miles up the road. The water was very hot and tasted very nasty. The text states, ìÖwater feeting somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degreesÖwhen I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.î Then he had to travel without water and became dehydrated. Travelling up and down hills he thought he began to imaginate a building that could possibly provide he with water. The building was there but it was abandoned. He decide he was going to suck on a couple of pebbles. The text says, ìIíd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thristÖî It was a desperate attempt to alleviate his growing discomfort.
890	6869	3	3	"It is hot, so the cyclist is very dehydrated, tired, and lacking water. ""I checked my water supply and heated on"" is a good example of this. There are also a lot of sad and deserted places with no cars around; this bars the cyclist's hope of finding civilization. Also, not seeing any buildings, and when he does, them being deserted, makes this very hard on the rider. Another event that takes a toll on him is when he finds the pump that has tar, dirt, and then hot water in it. Also, the road plays a toll on him. ""If I could just make it to that next horizon/hill, I'll be alright,"" he says. This is how I know the setting and features in the setting are affecting the cyclist mentally and physically. The harsh environment, with its lack of resources and signs of life, combined with the physical demands of the journey, clearly impacts the cyclist's state of mind and body."
891	6870	3	3	Hot, alone, no water- all are reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist. It is very hot as the cyclist is riding. This makes the cyclist feel worried about getting dehydrated, impacting his performance. The cyclist is alone and there is nothing in sight. If anything happened to him there is no one to help, increasing his anxiety. The cyclist had very little water and had to conserve it in order too stay active and have energy. With very little water it is hard to stay hydrated, making the ride even more challenging. Hot, alone, no water- all are reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist, significantly influencing both his physical and mental state.
892	6871	3	3	The terrain that a cyclist is riding on has a big affect on them. The first example of this is if they are riding on hills, it makes it much harder for them. For example, when the rider in the story saw that he was going to have to ride on hills he was, obviously, disappointed. Another thing that affects cyclists is the smoothness of the road they are riding on. In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the main character came to a rough spot in the road and was disappointed and didn’t want to ride it. Another aspect that can affect cyclists is the heat. Several times in the story, the cyclist says that he is tired and dehydrated; at one point he thinks he is going to die of heatstroke because the sun is reflecting off the road. Those are the effects of the rider’s setting on him/her.
893	6872	3	3	"The setting in the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" has a major effect on the cyclist. The setting is the high deserts of California where it is June and very hot. The path of the cyclist suggested by some old men makes the heat even worse because there are no people or water in sight. In the essay, the cyclist starts out the day confident and excited for his ride to Yosemite National Park. His mood changes throughout the day as after 60 miles he arrives in a ""ghost town"" the old men led him to believe would be a settled town where he could get more supplies and cool off. Soon as the temperature rises to what feels like ""two hundred degrees"" the cyclist begins to run low on water and feels ""sometimes life can feel so cruel."" The heat and lack of people and water lead the cyclist to desperation and make him feel like as he says ""i was going to die."" The setting of the cyclists journey provides the mood of hopelessness and amplifies the feeling of determination felt by the cyclist to keep going at all costs because he was going to die if he stopped. The author, Steinbeck uses the setting of the essay to help bring across his message that by blindly trusting people instead of trusting yourself things could end up being hard for you to overcome. Ultimately, the harsh environment emphasizes the importance of self-reliance and critical thinking."
894	6873	3	3	In the story ìDo not Exceed Posted Speed limitî the cyclist sees many different settings when he left it was early summer and it was pretty hot outside. He rode into the morning which would make him tired. The first town he reaches upon was a ghost town, so that means he could rest and get his supplies. Then he arrived by cool pines and a rushing river which probably made him feel relaxed. Then he showed up at a ramshackle shed with several rusty pumps and a carrel that couldn’t hold in the lamest mare. Gated men which people made him feel uncomfortable, and the pumps did not give him water so that was disappointing. Then he was riding through the California deserts in June which probably made him more dehydrated, and ultimately impacted his tiring journey.
895	6874	3	3	The cyclist should have never taken the advice from the older men. The map would have been a lot safer and easier. People seem to always look for a shortcut, including myself. He could have died from heat stroke and lack of water in that barren landscape. He did have perseverance though; he never gave up, and that is what saved him from a potentially fatal situation. Being in that situation and setting, I would have given up, succumbing to the harsh conditions, but his resilience ultimately saw him through.
896	6875	3	3	When cycling it's important to make yourself aware of the type of terrain it is, including hills, trails, or roads; make sure of the weather, checking for rain, wind, or extreme temperatures; make sure of the environment, being mindful of traffic and potential hazards; and most importantly make sure of your resources, such as water, food, and repair tools. These things are key before taking any cycling trip. They are very important in determining the type of trip you will have and ensure the difference between an enjoyable and relaxing trip, or a long and miserable trip, thus warranting careful consideration.
897	6876	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by travelling very far where he is going. For example, ""About forty miles into the pedal I arrived at the first town."" It's a good thing that he is taking water, or who knows if he would have survived or not given the distance. I think the biggest mistake was that he probably asked someone that had not ever been on the road for directions, leading to further complications. When he asked the person he ended up at a sign that said Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed, that was the moment I felt sorry for him, and that was probably the effective feature that has happened to him, highlighting how the unforgiving landscape impacted his journey. Therefore, the setting's challenges significantly shaped the cyclist's experience."
898	6877	3	3	In the story ìRough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speedî by @PERSON1 the settings of the story effects the rider in manyways. The first and most obvious is the temperature, it is hot, therefore the rider is hot and becoming dehydrated making him thirsty. A second way the setting affects the rider is the fact that nothing is around him. Since nothing is around him there is no where for him to get water adding to the affect of dehydration making him more thiristy. The rider says ìOne ran shacle shed, sevral rusty pumps, and the corral that couldnít hold the lamestmal egreeted me. ''This statement from the author support the factt that nothing is around. The desolation amplifies his sense of isolation and desperation. Onemore feature of the setting that affected the rider was the hills. The hills made the rider tired requiring more pedalind and wearing him out, the setting features had agreat afect on the rider from heat and dehydration to hills and energy. onething that the setting didnt have was a positive affected on the rider. Ultimately, the unforgiving environment serves to challenge the rider, testing his physical and mental endurance.
899	6878	3	3	In the story ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affected the cyclist. It was a hot June day and the water supplies he had was running out. He got the wrong directions so he had to ride his bike longer than he had to and he would need water from pedaling all that way for nothing. Since he was going in the wrong direction, there were no buildings for him to get water, there were no people so he couldnít communicate, and there would be no one to call for help in case he was overheated from the heat, which ultimately emphasizes the cyclist's vulnerability when faced with the harsh elements and isolation.
900	6879	3	3	In the story, the rider faced several melancholy sites. For example, the “ghost town” that he ran into at first really put a load on him because he had no one to ask for further directions or somewhere to freshen up from the long journey. Further on down the road the hill he came up on was a physical obstacle that he had to go over, testing his endurance. With the sun beating on his back and the emptiness of the road stretching endlessly before him, he might have begun to want to turn back, questioning his resolve. He kept on persevering, pushing through the doubt, which was how he eventually made it down the other side. The lack of water also made it difficult for him, compounding his struggles. Traveling with his water running out and beginning to feel sick did not go well with him, adding a layer of physical discomfort to his mental strain. Ultimately, his determination to continue despite these hardships demonstrates his resilience.
901	6880	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a negative way. For example, ""A tarlike substance oozed followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" This affects him because he can't get water from the well, meaning he needs water, but cannot get any. Also, the essay says the terrain is bad, so that means that the cyclist has to pedal harder to keep moving and he has to work harder in the hot reek. All this puts pressure on him from just what's around him. The old abandoned factory with the boy drinking juice had the most effect on the cyclist because he was so thirsty, and that was when he was about to give up hope. In this essay, the setting had a large affect on the cyclist, to the point where he thought he might die, demonstrating the power of environment on physical and mental endurance."
902	6881	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The speaker tells us that he’s riding his bike in the middle of the desert in June. This shows the author is probably very hot, and likely dehydrated as well. The author tells us that the road turned into hills and bumps. This would make it more difficult for the author because he would have to use more energy to move up the hill, tiring him out faster. And lastly, the cyclist tells us that the “towns” he came to were abandoned and uncared for. This would not be good for the cyclist because he would not be able to get water for his trip, thus amplifying the effects of the desert heat and challenging his survival. Therefore, the harsh and desolate environment directly impacts the cyclist's physical state and chances of successfully completing his journey.
903	6882	3	3	The @CAPS1 is affected in many ways. The major thing that effects him is the lack of water. Throughout the story he mentions the lack of water. He also continues to say to himself he should not have took that route. For example, ìI could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june because I listened to some gentlemen who hadnít been off thire porch in decades, caused me to laugh.î The @CAPS1 says things about the older gentle man throughout the story, showing his frustration with their poor advice and the predicament it has placed him in, highlighting the impact of dehydration and regret on his mental state. Ultimately, the lack of water and the poor decision to take the suggested route significantly impact @CAPS1 throughout the narrative.
904	6883	3	3	Setting very much affects the cyclist and how he feels. If he was in a bad setting then he would most likely be in a bad mood. Mood is highly affected by the general setting. In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclist feels very confident of himself, and the open road and clear weather help to boost that confidence and endurance. This favorable environment directly contributes to his positive emotional state, allowing him to push his limits.
905	6884	3	3	The features in the setting of the essay affected the author greatly. The Hills, on a hot day, with no water, or nearby town is really rough, especially if you’ve been riding for more than @NUM1 miles. The environment of the hot June weather near a dessert area can cause serious problems, for example heat stroke, and since he had no water to drink, dehydration caused a lot of fear in the author. The isolation and lack of resources amplified the threat. The setting of the essay and the conditions the author were under were extremely dangerous and he's lucky he made it out alive.
906	6885	3	3	That the cyclist is steadily going down a totally steep incline when trying to get to his destination of the town settlement, it all took place yesterday. The condition in hand and the hurry some when and have one his body felt the strain.
907	6886	3	3	In the short story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting greatly affects the cyclist. For example, in the beginning of the story, the cyclist is eager to get to Yosemite National Park. He listens to the advice of “old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” and quickly realized that he shouldn’t have. The author describes the setting of the first “town” as “the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This didn’t bother the cyclist as much as his next sight. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the largest mule” was what met him there. The cyclist said that “this sight was troubling,” as the desolation began to weigh on him. It is obvious that the cyclist has given up hope when he says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This short story shows how anything can get even the best of travellers worried about their survival, as the harsh and unforgiving landscape chips away at their resolve.
908	6887	3	3	"I think the features of the settings affect the cyclist because the knowledge of the cyclist is limited; for example, ""old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office"" suggests that their understanding of the current cycling environment and road conditions is outdated. This implies it's now time for the older people to observe the younger generation navigating those challenges, perhaps indicating a shift in experience and adaptability. Ultimately, the setting highlights how a lack of current knowledge can impact a cyclist's perception and interaction with their surroundings."
909	6888	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because where he is riding it is very dry and hot. He can deal with the heat with his good water supply, but when it runs out he begins to get disoriented. For example in the text he writes ìover one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirrage,î That statement shows that the cyclist was hot, and the images around him making him feel more hot than what he is, and his lack of water made him almost belive that he was imagining seeing a building. Another example is ìA sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hang my head.î This quote shows that the cyclist is in complete despair as he looks at the photo and hangs his head. The harsh environment, with its reminders of what he desperately needs but cannot obtain, further exacerbates his physical distress. This shows that the cyclist was constantly being reminded how hot and thirsty he was everywhere he would go and he couldn't get a drink. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.
910	6889	3	3	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” greatly affected the cyclist in the story. “Not two miles into this next reaction of ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie). The cyclist is travelling through hot, dry California in the middle of June without much water left. The fact that he now has to travel up and down short hills is going to make him even more tired, because going over hills requires more energy than flat riding. This energy loss, coupled with the cyclist's lack of water, causes him to become even more miserable. The heat intensifies his thirst as he exerts himself. The setting of this story greatly affected the cyclist.
911	6890	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist's mood and behavior. First, believing the shortcut will help him arrive at Yosemite faster, the cyclist is optimistic; then, he realizes it won't. Next, the harsh sun, rough terrain, and lack of water cause the cyclist to give up hope that he will make it to Yosemite, leading him to rethink his judgment and the importance of taking advice from others. Consequently, the difficult setting ultimately humbles him, forcing a reassessment of his abilities and decisions.
912	6891	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a harsh way. At first, the cyclist was fine and going strong, but soon after the first ghost town he was getting weak. Then the cyclist had to face a few problems; for example, he was running low on water, a precious resource in that desolate landscape. Also, he faced rough roads; last, he faced snakes and abandonment, increasing his sense of isolation. The cyclist had to face many obstacles, but in the end, he pulled through strong, proving his resilience against the odds.
913	6892	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist for these reasons. It says ""one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling."" That shows how the features affected the cyclist because he says the sight was troubling. It troubled him because he wanted water, and he saw the rusty pumps that reminded him of water, but he knew there was no water or it was nasty. These dilapidated features likely dashed his hopes for readily available refreshment, amplifying his thirst and fatigue, thereby influencing his emotional state."
914	6893	3	3	The conditions of the environment as well as the road can majorly affect the cyclist. For example, if someone was riding a bike in warm weather on flat land, it would not take major determination to pedal. On the other hand, if it is hot and there are rough paths and hilly roads, the biker could dehydrate, and it takes much more effort to get up and over the hill. Therefore, the conditions of the environment affect a cyclist greatly; simple changes in temperature and terrain can drastically change the difficulty and required effort.
915	6894	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î the cyclist, on his way to Yosemite National Park, is forced to face the rough deserts of California. As is normal throughout all deserts, the sun is blazing hot, as is the sand. There is no water anywhere and dangerous, highly venomous creatures are abundant. The lack of water almost puts him into a heat stroke as he is determined to leave the desert, riding his bike all alone. A grape juice factory taunts him, mocks him, but he continues on, with a steady pace. The desert roads are rocky and bumpy, and his lousy 12 mph speed is getting him practically nowhere. Until, finally, he reaches a modern area and drinks from the sink in the bathroom, relieved at his escape.
916	6895	3	3	In the story the setting plays a big role in effecting the cyclist. The terrain was very hard at times such a big hills and windy torns. Also, there was no one around. no houses, buildings or people which made him fell alone and life he was going to die. The author describes the terrain in one part of the story ìOver onelong, crippling hill a building came into view! This quote shows how the hills in the seting were very big and hard to get over. It also shows the significance of a single building and how excited he was to see it. The cyclist's feelings of isolation were definitely amplified by the empty landscape. In the story the author described many features from the setting which all greatly effected the cyclist, impacting both his physical and mental state throughout the journey.
917	6896	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist, by putting him in unwanted places, starting off with this man took advice from many older men, which don’t even know the area anymore. So riding through this, man seems lost. He is trying to follow their advice, but comes across many unknown, unwanted areas. He starts out good, then comes to a “Rough Road,” and he even says “sometimes life can feel so cruel.” Then he comes to this large snake in the middle of the road; scary enough, he has to slow ride past this thing taking up most of the road. Coming over these things was very strong and hard on this young man, showing the power of the challenging environment he was now facing.
918	6897	3	3	"The desert environment had huge effects on the cyclist. He had been drinking his water regularly and would be running out. Not realizing, there would be no refills because the pump was only giving ""a tarlike substance,"" said the text. With the lack of water, dehydration was beginning to hit the poor man hard. An effect of dehydration is poor balance that would have been useful to pass the ""ridiculously large snake"" he had seen. A final effect would be mirages that could lose your judgement, making navigation treacherous. This man double checked his eyes, when coming in view of a building, by ""[wiping] the sweat from (his) eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage."" Through all the toughest desert obstacles, the character was able to take the short cut and survive heat, dehydration, and animals of the desert, proving his resilience against the harsh conditions."
919	6898	3	3	"I think the features in the setting of the story ""Do not exceed the speed limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, highly affect the cyclist. Some implied information would be that it is very hot out, and the people in towns didn't help him. I know that it is hot because the text says, ""somewhere in the neighborhood of @NUM1 degrees."" This implies that it is very hot outside. I can tell the people in towns didn't help him because the text says, ""Never accept travel advice from collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office."" This shows that the people in towns didn't help him. Some expressed information in this text would be that there is a rough road, and a snake was in his way. I know this is expressed because it tells you right in the text: ""Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit."" This comes right out and tells you there is a rough road. You know there is a snake because the text says, ""and ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the road."" These explicit and implicit details of the setting strongly shape the cyclist's journey, presenting immediate obstacles and affecting his overall experience, and thus I think there are many implied and expressed information in the story ""Do not exceed the speed limit."""
920	6899	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a larger way, almost resulting in a very severe situation. The cyclist was in a desert. Like terrain, which was not densely populated on his trail, there was a lack of fresh water supplies, and the temperatures were more extreme. The cyclist could easily have fainted from heatstroke, due to the lack of water and excessive heat and work that he was doing pedaling. Had the area been more populated, he would have had more chances to stock up on water, greatly decreasing his risk of heatstroke. There were also the snakes which presented danger for him; had he been bitten, then he would be at least @NUM1 miles from the closest help, which could have proven fatal. Had the setting been, say, a city park, or a populated countryside, then this setting would have provided exponentially fewer problems and dangers for the cyclist, as resources and assistance would have been readily available. Therefore, the harsh desert environment significantly amplified the risks to the cyclist's well-being.
921	6900	3	3	"The conditions and features of the setting caused the cyclist to be tired and dehydrated and think that he was going to die from it. For example, it says ""and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."" He was struggling against the elements, facing the harsh reality of the summer heat. Also, he thinks he is getting dehydrated when he says ""I was doing a water depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life could be so cruel."" The arduous pace, combined with the lack of hydration, further fueled his fear. In conclusion, this cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration, highlighting the critical importance of preparation and awareness of environmental conditions when undertaking strenuous physical activities."
922	6901	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because heís in the middle of nowhere with no water. The cyclist had to ride his bike for over @NUM1 miles trying to get to Yosemite. ìI had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly.î This quote shows that he was beginning to run out of water. ìThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.î This quote shows how he really had nothing to drink at all, making his situation increasingly desperate. Having no water in the high deserts of California while riding your bike for over @NUM1 miles is not a good @CAPS1 unless you have a car, highlighting the precariousness of his journey and the significant impact the environment has on his well-being and chances of success.
923	6902	3	3	In the essay, the setting had everything to do with the cyclist because he is riding through the desert with barely any water. He is pedaling through the dry heat that's tough even if you *did* have water, plus there were hills and deadly snakes. It's dangerous enough without that stuff being there. So, I would listen to the cyclist and never ever listen to old men; the cyclist's experience is directly tied to the harsh realities of the desert.
924	6903	3	3	"On the cyclist's ride to Yosemite National Park, he encounters hardships due to the setting and advice from old men. Cycling in the California desert in June isn't ideal, exacerbating dehydration. He first encounters ""one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lament mule,"" a desolate scene suggesting he's in a ghost town, potentially stranding him. He describes ""short, rolling hills"" and ""one long, crippling hill,"" highlighting obstacles he faces on his bike to Yosemite. He realizes he's off track and needs help after encountering these terrain features. After surviving his surroundings, he gets help at a real camp. Thus, the story's setting significantly impacts the cyclist's ordeal and journey, shaping his challenges and ultimately his path to safety."
925	6904	3	3	ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî is an inspiring and almost humorous essay that takes the reader inside a cyclist's daily routine. In this story the author fights dehydration as he tries to make it to a national park with shortcut directions from ìold timers.î The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist and the pity the reader feels for him. Half way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles; thatís extremely crazy. The fact that he is travelling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down. At that point he wasnít really bothered. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states ìflat road was replaced by short rolling hills.î He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, the rocky roads probably didnít help his journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldnít have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life, but the harsh environment transforms the experience. The setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through, demonstrating the profound impact of environment on physical endurance and mental fortitude.
926	6905	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. It does because the road is not in good condition, with potholes and loose gravel, and he has to travel a long distance with the bad weather, facing strong winds and potential rain. This affects him because he might get dehydrated, fatigued, or even injured due to the challenging terrain and harsh conditions. In conclusion there are many things in the setting that affected the cyclist.
927	6907	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if they weren't hills and rough roads, he would have been able to get to Yosemite Park faster and he wouldn't have run out of water. The steep inclines forced him to exert more energy, depleting his water supply quicker than anticipated, and the uneven terrain slowed his pace considerably. Therefore, the challenging environment directly contributed to his difficulties in reaching his destination efficiently.
928	6908	3	3	The setting was the main affect on the cyclist. He said it was hot and that he was lost. The cyclist had no clue were he was going and it was hot out side. He seemed very strest and that only made it worse for him. He was thirsty from all riding and the heat so he trys to get water from a water pump. The water that was in it was horable. He called it a “substance” it had a flavor of battery acid. “If he were not lost and if it were cool outside he would have water and he would not be so upset. The setting of a hot and lost place had a huge impact on the cyclist.
929	6909	3	3	In my opinion the features of the selling affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when he was talking about the terrain changing from long straight roads to sharp windy ones and the speed limit changing, he said he was doing a water-depleting @NUM1 fueler, sounds like he is having a hard time, or doesn't want to go on. This highlights how external factors, like road conditions and regulations, can significantly impact a cyclist's physical and mental state, ultimately affecting their motivation and performance.
930	6910	3	3	Due to the features in the setting, including the hot summer weather, the cyclist not knowing the area, and the California desert the cyclist is affected. In the short story ìDo not exceed posted speed limitî by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist is travelling through the hot desert in June when he realizes hes running out of water, ìI had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in Juneî(Kurmaskie). This is affecting the cyclist because hes becoming hot and has a low supply of water. The relentless sun beating down, combined with the dry air, exacerbates his thirst and drains his energy. Also the cyclist realizes he should have never taken the direction from the old men and thinks to himself, ìÖThe growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in Juneî(Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the heat of the desert is taking a toll on him, making him acutely aware of the potential danger he faces. Ultimately, the harsh desert environment acts as a significant obstacle for the cyclist.
931	6911	3	3	The setting of this story affects the cyclist a lot. I think the setting was supposed to be most like a run-down, out-of-date town, which didn't help him when he was lost. The town is out of date and hot. This brings another problem: the cyclist was dehydrating because he didn't have enough water for the journey. He would hallucinate and see things that weren't there due to the heat and lack of hydration. He became very tired in the hot sun while trying to navigate the unfamiliar and dilapidated surroundings. So, the setting in this short story affected the cyclist in many ways, contributing to his disorientation and physical distress.
932	6912	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of the conditions he is in without any water. The cyclist would be fine if he would have had more water for his trip. He ran out of water not too far into his journey thanks to the heat of the setting he was in. The cyclist makes this statement: ""I was hitting my water bottle pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June."" The cyclist is saying that since it is so hot where he is, he has to take regular drinks of water so he stays hydrated throughout his trip. It is also saying that in the mountains, with less air and how hot it is, he is not doing as well as he thought he would on the trip, ultimately leading to dehydration and affecting his performance."
933	6913	3	3	The cyclist had a hard trail to bike in order to get to @LOCATION1. It is easy to bike if you are on flat smooth terrain, when you get to rolling hills, it makes it a lot tougher. The biker said ìI noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. It was also very hot. he was sweating and getting dehydrated, ìIíd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind of thirst.î he had eighteen miles to next town without much water. The first deserted town didnít have any drinkable water. It was very hard to bike in these conditions, and is important to always be prepared and know were you are going, because neglecting preparation can turn a challenging ride into a truly grueling ordeal.
934	6914	3	3	The cyclist has to endure ruff treain and bad road condisions and a lack of water is the dry heat near did not help the prodlem. Ther was a good prasority he could have heat strock then his hope was stll up by a abonded welches take factry. The cyclist had to endure rough terrain and bad road conditions, and a lack of water, coupled with the dry heat nearby, did not help the problem. There was a good possibility he could have heat stroke, then his hope was lifted by an abandoned welches cake factory.
935	6915	3	3	In Joe Kurmaskieís ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1î the imagery is what sets the cyclist back. The scorching dessert and plant life gives him a sense of seclusion and scares him. Because the cyclist is in the dessert he keeps on worrying about his water and heatstroke where as if he where in a rain forest he wouldnít worry about water or heat. I think he siked himself out just by taking in his sorroundings. If the cyclist would have pictured water all around him and arctic like temperatures I think he wouldnít have been so worried. Whatís interesting about this story is that if he would have gotten himself prepared mentally for the conditions he wouldnít have struggled so much at the end. ìAt some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back blocking the majority the pavement in front of me.î(Kurmaskie @NUM1). If the cyclist word of concentrated more on the task at hand and less on what was going on around him I think he would of succeeded without as much stress. The harsh environment clearly played a psychological role, impacting his confidence. Had he been able to mentally reframe the challenge, focusing on his capabilities rather than the daunting landscape, the outcome might have been different, highlighting the power of mental fortitude in overcoming physical obstacles.
936	6916	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in that it made him use up his water supply and tested his determination. “Sometimes life can be so cruel” implies that he was having a horrible time coping with the setting he was in. To himself he thought he was gonna die at any moment, as the relentless sun beat down and the barren landscape stretched endlessly before him.
937	6917	3	3	In the essay ìRough road ahead: do not exeed posted speed limit,î the author is continually depressed by the features of the landscape he passes. At first he passes a ghost town, but because he has enough water, this sight doesnít bother him. But the next thing he sees is a rundown old shed and a ìrusted water pump,î and this troubles him because he is running out of water. Then he sees a huge snake which does not help his mood, because the snake is blocking his path; then he passes an abandoned Welchís Grape Juice factory and despairs that he will never find water. Each feature of the setting, from the useless pump to the daunting snake and the defunct factory, serves to disappoint and depress the cyclist in his increasingly desperate quest to find water.
938	6918	3	3	In the story ìRough Road ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî a cyclist is faced with many problems. Itís really hot out, practically a desert and its in June. Just knowing that makes me want some water. Also this cyclist is running short of water and still hasnít got to the place he needs to be. The roads are hills and bumpy which make it harder for him. These difficult conditions and the scarcity of water create a real challenge for the cyclist. Those are the problems this cyclist is faced with, making the journey a true test of endurance.
939	6919	3	3	"At first, the narrator in ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" was energetic and enthusiastic about their journey to Yosemite National Park. After getting some helpful advice about a few shortcuts, the cyclist sets out for adventure. The first thing they encounter is a ghost town. The gentleman they had taken advice from had assured them it was a booming, prosperous town. This set the first wave of doubt through the cyclist's mind. Then, a lack of water began to take its toll. They were travelling through the high deserts of California in June and slowly running out of water. Flat road was soon replaced by short, rolling hills which only increased the cyclist's state of deliriousness. After a few more disappointments, including misleading signs and mirages that taunted with false hope, the cyclist decides there is no hope and they are going to die. The reader is partly drawn in, believing that this is the end for the cyclist. All of the disappointments set the stage for the end of the cyclist, and you can't stop reading because you have to find out what happens. If it weren't for the hopelessness of the setting, you wouldn't care, making the despair a crucial element that drives the narrative and keeps the reader invested in the cyclist's fate."
940	6920	3	3	When the cyclist is going on his trip, he is riding through a desert. All he sees the entire journey is a flat road and dirt. He is riding on the road, hopelessly hoping for some form of life. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. The author is trying to be positive but it's hard, because all this scenery is doing is bringing his hopes down. How would you like it if you were riding a bike and had no water in the middle of a desert? Now, if the setting had been a nice, green forest, he wouldn't be that worried, there's water and shade. He has none of that in the desert, only the scorching sun and endless expanse. This whole journey was all mental; the physical hardship was immense, but the real battle was within. He always kept in his mind that everything would be ok, repeating mantras of hope and resilience. That is what helped him survive, pushing him forward when his body screamed for rest. This is an inspiring story, to anyone who needs a push to stay optimistic, a testament to the power of a positive mindset in overcoming adversity.
941	6921	3	3	"Poor directions, heat, and lack of water affect the cyclist in the story. At the beginning of the story, the cyclist is confident in the directions which would, ìslice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.î As the story progresses, the cyclist is no longer so confident, realizing the map's promises were empty. The ìheat of the California, June day causes him to be fluent in drinking water.î ""I had been hitting my water bottle pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June,"" he recalls, emphasizing the increasing desperation. This lack of water is a big problem for the cyclist, so big that he was near heat stroke, each pedal stroke a monumental effort. ìI eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.î He braved the elements and forced himself on, with hopes that any source of water would reveal itself to him, his vision blurring with exhaustion. His perseverance paid off, rewarding his resolve. ìThen, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me."" The cyclist had found a barber shop and received water, a simple act of kindness that rejuvenated him, highlighting how crucial hydration is to endurance."
942	6922	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. I say this because the setting is in the hot deserts of @LOCATION1. The cyclist is sweaty and tired and has almost no water left. This lack of water makes the cyclist desperate for food and water, impacting their decision-making. The harshness of the environment, with its relentless sun and arid landscape, contributes significantly to the cyclist's physical and mental state. The setting, therefore, has a lot to do with how the cyclist reacts to what happens.
943	6923	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, because there was no one in sight he couldn't ask for any help or direction, leaving him completely isolated and reliant on his own resources. Also, because of all the road conditions it was hard to ride a bike through all the rocky roads, making his journey slow and arduous, and he was very tired and dehydrated so that didn't help him it just tired him more, further weakening his condition. Another reason is because of the poisonous snakes; if he disturbed them they could harm him, posing a constant threat of a venomous strike. Also, if he would had fallen off his bike a snake could have bitten him and then he wouldn't be able to make it anywhere because of the bite, potentially leaving him stranded and helpless. Those are the features of the setting that affected the cyclist, creating a challenging and dangerous situation.
944	6924	3	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. It affects him physically because of the rolling hills he has to trudge over and the lack of water he has. The rolling hills make him tired and weak, and the rough terrain adds to his physical exhaustion. The lack of water doesn’t help any when he’s thirsty because of the hills. The features affect him mentally because the farther he goes the more delirious he gets. Each mile he keeps telling himself, if I can just get there I’ll be fine. He also blames himself for listening to the old men. And with this also came doubt. He was doubting that he could make it alive. In the story it says, “it didn’t really matter: I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Mentally he couldn’t make it, as the harsh environment eroded his hope and will to survive.
945	6925	3	3	When the rider was riding his bike in such day settings has started to need water he was running out, so his whole adventure was to find water. Being thirsty was very hard because it made him not want to keep going because he was so tired. The thirst made it harder on him. But the struggle also got him more strength and belief in himself, and to keep on pushing through the difficulty.
946	6926	3	3	îDo not Exceed the posted speed limitî tells a story of learning and determination, as one cyclist bikes through the deserts of California, encountering obstacles such as snakes and a lack of water along the way. The descriptive features of the setting greatly affect the protagonist along his journey. The essay takes place in the early summer. As the cyclist prepares to retire for the day, he takes particular note of ìthe serenity of an early summer evening,î and ends the day feeling calm and at peace with his surroundings, ready for a good night's rest. The next morning he is excited and rejuvenated, ready to bike again, feeling the cool morning breeze on his face. The heat rises as the day goes on, and by mid-day the cyclist begins to worry about his water supply, carefully rationing what little he has left. He boldly continues forth reaching new terrain, rolling hills that seem to stretch endlessly before him. Here he begins to lose hope, and is disappointed when he sees the ìtownî he hoped to find is just an abandoned juice factory, a monument to broken dreams. The cyclist thinks he is going to die due to the heat and lack of hydration, his body screaming in protest, but gathers his strength to turn the final bend, and reaches a bait shop where he can stop and get water, finally finding relief and a renewed sense of hope. In conclusion, as the cyclist continues his journey through the California desert, the change in both weather and terrain coincide and affect the cyclistís change in physical and mental strength to continue traveling, highlighting the profound impact of the environment on the human spirit.
947	6927	3	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. For example, the story said,""I gathered up a few pebbles and stock them in my mouth"" This quote explains that the setting was very dry and had pebbles. The setting benefiting him by taking the thirst off his mind. If their wasn't any pebbles by the cyclist he might not have made it. In cocnlusion in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the cyclist was benefited by the features of the setting."
948	6928	3	3	The features of the setting affect any cyclist because with the cyclist passing much time on the bicycle, they might experience back problems later in life. When they are older and have spent considerable time cycling, they may face serious issues and potentially reduced mobility. This highlights the long-term impact of prolonged cycling on physical health, particularly concerning back problems and mobility in later years.
949	6929	3	3	The setting in the essay “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed the Speed Limit” affected the narrator in many ways. The first thing that affected his ride was the heat. At first he didn’t really notice, but then it began to slow him down. Then the ways of the roads began to affect his ride; the roads went from flat sheet to short, rolling hills. The road change and the heat made him say, “I could drop from heatstroke.” Then, because of the old towns he went through, he was unable to get water. The water pumps were so old and unused for so long that the water was of very poor quality, making his journey quite difficult and highlighting the challenges presented by the harsh environment.
950	6930	3	3	The complex features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively throughout this story. His trip goes from bad to worse as he progresses to Yosemite. After taking directions from the ìold codgers,î the author attempts the shortcut, but is dissapointed to find it far more challenging than anticipated. He arrives at the first town but it is completely deserted and eerily silent. He rubbed it off though, and kept ìthe cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,î as his motivation, visualizing the reward that awaited him. He pedaled on, but began to run out of water and his desperation increased; when he arrived at a well, he found the water to be inedible, further diminishing his morale, and continued onward. Just as if things couldnít get any worse his trail was getting rougher, becoming increasingly difficult to navigate, and his water supply was low, heightening his physical discomfort. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated, and began to lose hope that he'd ever reach his destination. He became even more of a pessimist when ìa ridiculously large snake- blocked the majority of the pavementÖî, symbolizing another seemingly insurmountable barrier. He kept going, and excitedly pedaled toward a building in the distance, but found it to be abandoned, dashing his hopes once more. He even put rocks in his mouth to help his dehydration, a testament to his dire situation. When he finally found the fish camp, he was relieved, feeling an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. All the obstacles he prospered through were worth it in the end, as the beauty of Yosemite finally became his reward.
951	6931	3	3	The journey of a solo cyclist is a lonely one. The cyclist in ìDo not exceed posted speed limitî had a particularly hard journey, as made even worse by the setting. His main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat. In the California deserts on a day in June, it was no surprise that the sun would be beating down particularly harder than it would at another place anytime. Also, as the terrain became hillier, his journey became even harder. There is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line. But constantly pedaling yourself up steep hills and around winding roads is no picnic. Just like the buildings around him, the cyclist’s water deteriorated, as did his state of mind, as his trip, which started out very joyful, became increasingly more morbid. ìIt didnít really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.î This cyclist was fighting against strong forces of nature, pushing his physical and mental limits to the brink. Ultimately, the cyclist's struggle highlights the immense challenges faced when battling both internal despair and the harshness of the natural world.
952	6932	3	3	"In the short story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting plays an extremely important role. The story takes place in sunny California, where the cyclist was pedaling around 12 mph. The heat made his dehydration situation much worse. ìI was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.î The cyclist was losing hope, yet he was still determined to find water. This setting was very important to the story, for if it had taken place at @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, it would not have made sense. The relentless sun beating down on the asphalt road, combined with the dry air, intensified his thirst and exhaustion. The setting contributes to the story by raising the intensity of the situation, making the cyclist's struggle for survival all the more compelling."
953	6933	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they started to mess with her mind. She didn’t know where she was and on top of that got lost. Whether you see nothing around you or a lot around you, you’re going to feel scared. They have the same effect. In the author's case, she was cycling and didn’t have any food or water. This is an overwhelming feeling because you can die from dehydration. She then kept cycling and saw nothing, “no one in sight; not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” That is isolating, no water or people around, as if you are going to be just left to die. These settings would affect anyone who came across them. They definitely affected the cyclist because she was by herself, and on her own. Plus, all she had was a map, her bike and an empty water bottle, making her situation even more precarious and contributing to her mounting fear and disorientation.
954	6934	3	3	The features of this story tend to affect the cyclist very much. Because he took a shortcut he had an even longer journey than before. He was in the middle of nowhere with barely any water left and, on top of all that, he's exhausted from all the hills on the terrain. So because he took a shortcut it ended up costing him in the long run, demonstrating that sometimes the most direct route isn't always the most efficient or beneficial one.
955	6935	3	3	The features of the setting in the essay affected the cyclist because first of all he listened to old folks that hadn’t left their front porch in about ten years. Then, he didn’t ask someone else’s opinion on where to go and how to get there, relying on unreliable advice. His worst mistake, though, was not trusting the map he had with him the whole time. If he would have just trusted his map and not gone with what the old fella said, he wouldn’t have almost died of heat stroke, highlighting the importance of preparation and reliable navigation.
956	6936	3	3	In the essay, ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects him negatively because he was on his bicycle and he was in a hot area and no water whatsoever, like in this quote, ìI got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance ozzed out.î In the quote, the cyclist finally thinks he has found a water pump, a potential source of relief from the oppressive heat, but he really gets nothing but a disappointing, unusable substance. Also, another negative thing is that he thought he was never going to get to where he was going, feeling the miles stretch endlessly before him under the scorching sun, but in the end, he got there and he got some water, a much-needed reward after a grueling journey, proving that even in the face of adversity, perseverance can lead to relief.
957	6937	3	3	"The setting in the story affects the main character greatly because of the heat. The main character is biking through a desert in the summer with little water. The heat of the setting provides a problem because the main character is at risk of dehydration and heatstroke. The main character knows that if he passes out in the barren desert he will surely die. The main character says, ""The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke"" weighs heavily on his mind. The main character is faced with a problem of man versus nature and the heat is winning. Heat and dehydration sap the main character's energy while he is biking through a desert, desperately trying to make it to the next town for water. In summary, the main character's biggest problem is the heat of the setting."
958	6938	3	3	The setting around the cyclist affected him in one main way. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ìtownî (Kurmaskie). The cyclist put the words towns in to parentasis because it was actually a Ghost town. No one lived there; it was abandoned. Around the cyclist were deserts, and more empty towns loomed in the distance, adding to his sense of isolation. The farther the cyclist got, the more he realized the old men were wrong, as the cyclist was running low on water and there was nowhere to stop for supplies, making him increasingly desperate. He finally found some water after hours of searching and vowed to never listen to old men's directions again, having learned a harsh lesson about trusting unreliable advice in a desolate landscape.
959	6939	3	3	All the feature of the area have a have a big affect on the cyclist. It is a hot June morning, and he is on his bike, pedaling hard, going many miles. He can't find any water, because all the towns along the road are deserted. He is getting dehydrated, and losing strength. It seems like he might have collapsed if he hadn't thought he was going to reach salvation soon@CAPS1, and if he hadn't gotten some water at that store. All in all, the setting seems to have the intention of king him.
960	6940	3	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road: Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist in a very negative way. It begins slowly with the “ghost town.” The narrator “chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on,” he wasn’t especially worried, but the fact he checked his water suggests that he’ll need to ration it for a while. The decline continues when he reaches the fork and the “ramshackle shed.” The description of the place shows you he did not like it, and he confirms that with the words, “this sight was troubling.” He wouldn’t be replenishing his water here, and the isolation is starting to weigh on him. Any more of this he’d be dead, either from dehydration or from pessimism. Eventually he reached the road sign which declared that going over 55 mph was a bad idea. This is ironic, he only going 12 mph; to put it in his own words, “sometimes life can be so cruel.” He quite obviously hates the setting, and it’s all the fault of the setting, which relentlessly chips away at his optimism and threatens his survival.
961	6941	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he had limited water, he had to peddle harder to get up over the hills and he was getting dehydrated from the heat. For example, he had limited water because he had taken the directions from the old men and probably didn't bring as much as he would have if he would have taken a longer way. This lack of preparation exacerbated the challenges he faced. Furthermore, to get up the rolling hills he had to peddle faster and harder. That affected him because he would have been more exhausted from peddling. The increased physical exertion further depleted his resources. Moreover, it was a June day and in June the days are hot; with the lack of a good amount of water the cyclist would have started to get dehydrated. The relentless sun intensified his physical strain. This is how the setting affected the cyclist, creating a perfect storm of challenges that made his ride significantly more difficult.
962	6942	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, his body heat raised a good bit. They don’t come out and say it, but they do say, “The sun was beginning to beat down.” We all know that if you're outside when it’s hot, you get hot too. The rising temperature also probably added to his dehydration. As a long distance runner, I know what the sun will do to you during a hot day, causing you to sweat more and lose fluids faster. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.
963	6943	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. For one, if the desert was not a deserted mountainous area in California then the cyclist would not have the same problems with heat exhaustion, lack of water, and potential wildlife encounters. By changing any one feature of the setting you would change how the cyclist would behave in the setting, perhaps leading to different choices regarding navigation or resource management. Thus changing the entire plot of the story. If the cyclist was say in the city or a merely developed area then he would not face the same dangers as if he were in a mountainous region, such as getting lost or facing extreme weather conditions. The setting's features have a huge affect on the cyclist, significantly shaping the challenges he faces and ultimately influencing the outcome of his journey.
964	6944	3	3	In Joe Kurmaskie's story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting's features appear negative to the cyclist. The setting starts to worry the cyclist just two miles after he confidently predicted he could easily cover the next @NUM1 miles. For example, the cyclist states, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,” indicating his concern that the journey wouldn't be as effortless as anticipated. From that point onward, the setting seems to deteriorate further for the cyclist. Later, the cyclist exclaims, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This was when the cyclist began to truly notice his fear of dehydration, compounding the difficulties presented by the harsh environment. Ultimately, the cyclist perseveres and makes it through, realizing the profound impact nature can exert.
965	6945	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by unexpected things happening. His water supply got drank quickly, and he couldn’t find a town nearby. He was in the desert-like California landscape, and the sun was beating down on him, intensifying the heat. When he did find one town, it was more of a “ghost town,” and had rusted pumps that had battery-oil tasting liquid. Every person he asked told him the next town was near, but from dehydration, it took him longer to reach. The roads got windy, and small hills occurred, further draining his energy. There was a large snack in the middle of the road, as the tumble weed blew by, a testament to the desolation. He finally saw a town that had a bait shop and was able to get water and cool down, finally escaping the harsh environment. Therefore, the unforgiving setting posed numerous challenges to the cyclist, pushing him to his limits until he found respite.
966	6946	3	3	"The setting in ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit definitely affected the author. The cyclist states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist probably found it more difficult to navigate through the ""hills"" as opposed to the ""Flat roads,"" making him more quickly tired, impacting his overall speed and endurance. The speaker states, ìI could drop from heatstrokeî (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The speaker is implying that it is so hot outside that he could faint from a ëheatstrokeí which could slow him down, and potentially put him in a dangerous situation. The speaker also states,""water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees""(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The author did not have any good water to drink, because it was so hot outside, which affected him in that he was dehydrated, further diminishing his physical capabilities. Many aspects of the setting affected the cyclist, creating difficult conditions that challenged his physical well-being and progress."
967	6947	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if the old men didn't give the boy advice then he probably wouldn't have run into all the trouble he ran into. Their directions, though well-intentioned, led him astray and into a more dangerous part of the trail. At the same time the boy made his way to where he was going, albeit with difficulty. Next time though he will just use his map so he doesn't have to go through the scare of death again, and he will be sure to stick to the marked path.
968	6948	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by the roadís condition being rough as the cyclist rides further along the road, making the journey increasingly challenging and demanding more physical exertion with each passing mile.
969	6949	3	3	The setting of this short story has a big affect on the cyclist. Since the story takes place in the desert, the temperature is very hot. The cyclist only packed enough water for the intended trip. Since he made a few wrong turns, he ended up needing more water. There were no signs of civilization so he could not stop any where and buy water. He came to a ìrun-downî rusty fauret and tried to drink water from it, but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. If this short story had a different setting, then the story would not make much sense. For example, if the story would have taken place in a bustling city, he could have just stopped and bought water. The setting is one of the most important elements in a story.
970	6950	3	3	The features affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the road, the rocks, and even the weather all play a role. The cyclist needs to know everything about where he's going, because if not then he can run into some problems along the way, for example, like snakes, rough terrain, or rocks in the way. That's why it's important for a cyclist to be self-reliant and attentive to their surroundings. That's why when you see cyclists you often see them around roads where there are cars around, just in case they get into trouble and need assistance.
971	6951	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it give it more life, adding depth to their experience. More meaning is derived from the environment, enriching the narrative and making it fun to read, as the setting's details contribute to the overall enjoyment.
972	6952	3	3	At times when the features of the setting are bad it can have a great impact on the cyclist. For one if itís too hot the cyclist is going to need plenty of water if he/she does'nt want to be dehydrated. There are also the dangers of heat strokes and deadly snakes, cyclist might want to avoid that. When your a cyclist times can be hard just prepared for the long run, and adapt to the environmental challenges that may arise.
973	6953	3	3	The setting in the story ìRough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî really goes against the cycilist and his journey. This is because in the places he goes there is no water, and if there is, it is really hot or bad water, which makes his journey difficult. For example, on page @NUM1 it says, ìa tarlike substance oozed out, but the water wouldnít cool down,î This explains how bad the water was when the cycilist was there, hindering his progress. The harshness of the environment clearly works against the cyclist's efforts.
974	6954	3	3	During this essay the author is talking about his journey, a path marked not by grand adventures or exotic locales, but by a series of quiet shifts in perspective. It was a journey inward, a slow and sometimes painful unraveling of long-held beliefs and assumptions. It began, subtly, with a question, a persistent whisper of doubt that refused to be silenced. This initial inquiry then led to further reflection, forcing a confrontation with uncomfortable truths and a gradual reshaping of his understanding of the world and his place within it. The author’s journey, therefore, is one of continuous learning and self-discovery. And while the destination may remain elusive, the value lies in the transformative power of the journey itself, in the willingness to question, to learn, and to grow.
975	6955	3	3	The setting included nice cool pines and then a ghost town, and it being hot out. There were banners of @CAPS1 and poison snacks, and hills that were getting harder to go up. When he first started, the pines were nice and cool, but when he scanned the ghost town, he felt discouraged, then it started to get hot. Then he saw the snack and thought that it was a deformed baby and was nervous. He was scared of dehydration, then the hills started to make it harder and harder; that is what it was like, presenting a journey that grew increasingly challenging and unsettling.
976	6956	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he has to use more energy to pedal up hills and through rocky terrain. Therefore he drank more water. When he couldn't find any more water, he had to slow down to conserve energy, illustrating how environmental challenges directly impact his physical exertion and hydration levels.
977	6957	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first was the terrain, which started out flat, then turned to hills. The cyclist was growing tired from all the pedaling. ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î This tired him out faster, since going uphill is harder than riding flat terrain, requiring more energy. The heat definitely affected him, because it made him thirsty. He was ìtravelling through the high deserts of California in June.î This is a very hot time of year, and when a person gets lost without conserving water, which he had not done, a person gets extremely thirsty. Not to mention the ìsandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,î which would remind the body of its thirst, intensifying his craving. So the setting most definitely affected the cyclist.
978	6958	3	3	In the story, the cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting. For example, the setting has nothing for miles, just ghost towns, making it impossible to find any water. Also it's a desert-like setting, adding to his thirst. Another example is the hills that made him even more thirsty as he had to exert himself. It was June in California so it must have been pretty hot, and also the town that he got to had no water because they seemed deserted. Another example is the stone he put under his tongue, a trick that lets you survive a lot more effectively by stimulating saliva production. Therefore the settings affected his journey and made him wish he didn't take the old man's advice, as the harsh landscape and lack of resources turned his ride into a desperate struggle for survival.
979	6959	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Three features I found were the lack of the water, the heat and the conditions and limits of the road. The lack of water really affected the cyclist. When he/she was dead tired he/she didn’t have anything to drink. The essay stated how he/she would save the water til the end, rationing it carefully. He/she was so tired, so the lack of water really affected him/her, making the journey even more arduous. The conditions he/she was in really affected the cyclist also. From the beginning he/she was told the wrong directions, setting the stage for a difficult ride. That was the reason why he/she was lost the entire time, adding to the physical and mental strain. Finally, the limits of the road affected the cyclist. Hills and different grounds did not help the cyclist, making it harder to maintain speed and momentum. In conclusion, the cyclist had many factors affecting him/her such as lack of water, limits of the road and his/her conditions, all contributing to a challenging and difficult experience.
980	6960	3	3	"I think that the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, I think the weather conditions affect him. I think this because in the passage it says, ""I could drop from heatstroke"". Meaning, it's really hot! Also, I think the fact that he has no water left is affecting him because it says in the passage, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"". This has a big affect on him, because he's very thirsty, and dehydration can make it difficult to concentrate. Also, I think the fact that there is nothing around him is affecting him. I think this because in the passage it says there were no cars, suggesting isolation. All these factors together demonstrate how the environment significantly impacts the cyclist's physical and mental state."
981	6961	3	3	"In ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist takes advice from some old guys and ends up wishing he never did. He is on an empty road, flat and dry. He ends up drinking all of the water he has, and needing to stop for some more. ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" He stopped to get more water, but once, all that came out was some tar like stuff, and then he couldn’t find another place for quite a white. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills and he came to a sign that said ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limitî, and passed tumble weeds and a large snake. All of these things impacted his journey with fear, caution, etc. When he finally reached a place to get a drink, he was finally satisfied. Because it was hot, and empty, he was more thirsty so therefore the setting affected the cyclist. The arid climate, combined with the desolate landscape and the lack of accessible water sources, intensified his thirst and dictated his need for frequent hydration, illustrating how the environment directly influenced his physical state and actions."
982	6962	3	3	He feels alone; there is no one around him to push him, and yet he keeps going, trying to push himself to the end to win. He grits his teeth, focusing on the finish line ahead. The fast roads are rough, and the hills are tall, testing his endurance, but he is determined to finish, fueled by an inner fire that refuses to be extinguished. He will see this through, no matter the obstacles.
983	6963	3	3	Heat, abandoned roads, snakes all are reasons that affected the cyclist. The relentless heat made him get dehydrated faster while he was using energy to pedal. The long abandoned roads, cracked and overgrown, further increased his doubt of surviving the whole bike ride. He used up all of his water quickly. So when he finally got to the old pump, sputtering and groaning, only hot dirty water came out. The snake slithering across his path in the story made the journey for this guy even more perilous and deadly. This all happened because he stubbornly refused to listen to the old guys' advice initially. When the other old guy was about to tell him where to go, offering crucial directions, he confidently said no, sealing his unfortunate fate; this decision ultimately contributed to the cyclist's struggles.
984	6964	3	3	The features and the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One reason was that he was in the desert. Like in the quote “through high deserts of California,” this means that it was hot and he could pass out from a heat stroke. Then he couldn’t even get any water. Like on the quote “of the rusted water pump,” it was describing how old it was; then the cyclist got some out, but it tasted like old battery acid, making it undrinkable and unhelpful. Therefore, the features and setting affected the cyclist.
985	6965	3	3	The features of the setting intensely effect the cyclist over period of time. Destined to reach Yosemite National Park from Lodi, California, a determined cyclist rode strongly through the gentle evening. When the setting changed, so did the effect it had on the cyclist. When the man reached the first town, which was deserted, energy began depleting because the sun began to come into the picture, beating down with increasing intensity. Next, he came to a shed desperate for water only to find rusty pumps with tainted, unsafe water, adding to his despair. When the flat terrain turned to rolling hills, the man was entirely exhausted. “With what I believed to be my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.” That quote directly describes what the man was feeling and how the hills effected him. When the man stumbled across a fish camp with water, he became reloaded and replenished with confidence he had before when he “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile.” Therefore, the cyclist's journey highlights how deeply physical and mental states are intertwined with and shaped by the environment.
986	6966	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he was riding in the desert and all the towns he was going to were abandoned, adding to his sense of isolation. The month was June, a hot month, and the sun was beating down on him, quickly draining his energy. And he was cycling with very little water, making the already harsh conditions even more perilous for his journey.
987	6967	3	3	"In the essay ìDo Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limitî the setting effects the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, he described it as a ghost town. This effected the cyclist because he started to have doubts about the directions he received, but he was looking foward to the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite so he persevered. The setting of the next land mark was similar to the last. There was a shed, a few rusty pipes and a corral that ""Couldnít hold in the lamest mule.î This made the cyclist more werry of the path ahead because he was running out of water. The next place was also similar. There was an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The cyclist was running out of water and now thought he was going to die because everything was deserted. Then, finally, the setting changed. There was a store that was actually opened. The cyclist then felt happy and relieved. That is how the different settings effected the cyclist and his journey."
988	6968	3	3	The authorís setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding. The author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist. The author also said that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to beat down. That means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat which lowers your water retention. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclistís location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since heís traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple of towns, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills. Hills take a bigger toll on a personís body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill. All of these factors combine to create a challenging environment for the cyclist, demanding significant physical exertion and careful hydration management.
989	6969	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. From the ghost town to the bait shop, it was all a challenge for him. A misleading challenge, but a challenge. In the desert is where water grew short, and he tried everything to push himself. From staring at the horizon to get from one place to another, from sucking on pebble stones to not focus on water. And when he arrived at the bait shop, a sense of relief came to him, like that shop was his safe haven. But yet he would never get directions from any old-timer again. Lack was not a factor in this story; rather, it was drive and the overall climate of the story. When it was two hundred degrees left, and no water left, he pushed himself to the light. And also when he saw a building, he was determined to get to it, proving his resilience in the face of harsh conditions and the deceptive nature of the landscape.
990	6970	3	3	The cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was in Lodi, California when he decided to ask for directions from old codgers so that he could take a short cut. He followed their directions and little did he know that he should have stuck to his original directions. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June, the sun relentlessly beating down. The cyclist became very hot and thirsty from traveling in the desert. It says in the text ìwhen I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acidî This shows that he had no water left to kept him dehydrated throughout his travel, his lips cracked and his throat parched. Also in the text it says ìwith what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hillî this shows that he had no energy left, his legs heavy and his vision blurring. The shortcut, a well-intentioned but ultimately misguided piece of advice, had led him to the brink of exhaustion, a stark reminder that sometimes the well-trodden path is the safest one to follow.
991	6971	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Ahead ;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie he goes through all kinds of settings where the going could get better or worse. ìI noticed the terrain changing, flat roads was replaced with short rolling @NUM1 Kurmaskie). This shows or explains that the going could get a little tougher now because he will have to be riding up hills and he is almost out of water. ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kindî (@NUM2 Kurmaskie). This explains that the man could not get water or a ride from anywhere around, because there was nothing out there to get it at. This is how the setting features affected the cyclist, making his journey potentially more arduous and isolating him from potential assistance.
992	6972	3	3	Almost all the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance, the fact that it is hot causes him to drink a lot of water and need a lot of water. In the story it goes on about how thirsty and sweaty he is. ìThe water bottles contains only a few tantalizing sips. Wid rings of sweet circled my shirt.î These description suggests that he is very hot since he is sweaty and he's been drinking so much. Another feature of the setting is the rolling hills that make him feel like he is never going to reach the next town. ìI began breaking the ride down into distress I could make it test for.î He is breaking the ride down into a lot of short rides so he could make it. The environment, with its heat and challenging terrain, profoundly impacts the cyclist's experience, shaping his physical state and mental approach to the journey.
993	6973	3	3	The setting is described by the author, were very challenging for three reasons, distance, water and the heat. All of these only occurred to multiply the effects of the others. As time had went on, the cyclist grew tired from the heat. The cyclist felt the heat sucking the strength from his legs, making each pedal stroke a monumental effort.
994	6974	3	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. The scenery makes the cyclist turn worried, unconfident, and in the end an ironic hopeful. The cyclist came upon the first ""town"", and described it as only having ""one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corrall"". I believe this is when the cyclist realized the men were a little off, and began to worry; the desolate scene, devoid of life, likely amplified his unease. He also couldn’t refill water supply, so fear of dehydration also kicked in. Already tired, the cyclist became unconfident when he came upon the sign reading, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"". Knowing that this was going to be a long and slow journey, the cyclist becomes unconfident that he can make it. Finally, when passing the sign saying, ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp – If you want bait for the big ones, we’ve your best bet,"" the cyclist reached a hopeful stage, because he knew he had found civilization once again, or at least the promise of it. This small indication of community offered a renewed sense of possibility. I believe your atmosphere and surroundings can effect your general mood, and that stands true today with the cyclist. The changing landscape directly influenced his emotional state, demonstrating the powerful connection between environment and mindset."
995	6975	3	3	"The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist is by either making the ride easy for him or tough for him. In the essay it said ""No Town"" but without a town theres no water and water @MONTH1 lead to dehydration. It also says something about flat roads turning into ""short, rolling hills."" This means that the way he had to go was tough and making it hard for the cyclist to stay focused. The lack of readily available water and the unexpected hills create a challenging environment, demanding more physical exertion and mental fortitude from the cyclist, illustrating how the setting directly influences his experience."
996	6976	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because the passes are on a road with a lot of hills; it would affect him by making him tired. Also, if the biker was in a place where it was cold or hot, it would affect him, his temperature, and his attitude. Therefore, the environment significantly impacts the cyclist's physical condition and overall performance.
997	6977	3	3	The settings in this article effect the cyclist by having to bike a lot of miles to get to the next town. The cyclist has a limited amount of water, and it's very hot out, making the journey even more challenging. There's nothing in sight for miles and miles; the relentless sun beats down, and the vast emptiness amplifies the cyclist's isolation and struggle against dehydration, highlighting the harshness of the environment.
998	6978	3	3	The futures of the setting affect the cyclist was that he show the map to other people and he shouldn’t listen to others where he had to go. This likely meant he became more independent in his navigation and decision-making, relying on his own understanding of the map rather than the potentially misleading directions of others, ultimately shaping his future routes and experiences.
999	6979	3	3	In the essay ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î many features of the setting affected the cyclist. And these settings could be easily formed in the middle part of the essay. And these settings caused the cyclist exhaustion on his journey. First, the cyclist noticed a road change from flat to short, rolling hills. He had to spend more energy to go up the hills which caused him to lose a certain amount of energy. Then, his lack of water caused him a dehydrated state. He could lose another large amount of energy because of this, and in this state, he mostly needs someone to support him or be on his side, but he was riding alone, there was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. This might cause his emotional breakdown to make his energy loss even more significant. Overall, the cyclist suffered a loss of energy on his journey, and was unable to have a supporter to help him get through the ordeal.
1000	6980	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it can provide landmarks and directions. For example, the narrator states, ìTheyíd sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jauntî (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the landmarks can provide as landmarks and directions along a journey. These external reference points in the environment offer a sense of orientation and help the cyclist track their progress, ultimately influencing their experience and navigational capabilities.
1001	6981	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed posted speed limit” the cyclist has some very rough obstacles on his way to Yosemite National Park. With his lack of water and tiredness, he runs into a big snake that he thinks is a diamond black. He easily passes the snake and moves on. Being in the intense heat and with no water, he never gives up and knows he can make it to the park safely. The reason why he goes this way is because old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in the office gave him wrong directions. That really affected the cyclist because all of the other stuff wouldn’t have happened if he had paid attention to his surroundings and the people around him; his journey highlights the importance of being aware and cautious, and ultimately, perseverance helps him push through.
1002	6982	3	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist on different occasions in different ways. For instance, when arriving at the first town, the author calls it your average ghost town but continues on with confidence. The next building he saw was an abandoned Welch’s Juice bottle factory; on the building was a sign with a boy drinking a cold glass of juice. This intimidates the rider; he begins to question the wisdom of the old men. Continuing on, he reaches another building. To his relief, it's a bolt shop that was still in business. He goes to the sink immediately to drink the water; at this point, he is relieved to have water and be near civilization instead of in the desert without a sight of life or building. The harshness of the environment ebbs and flows, impacting his mental state. Therefore, his surroundings throughout the story make him indifferent, confident, and relieved, showcasing how external factors can significantly influence one's emotional state.
1003	6983	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the roads are rough, uneven, and he has to push out more energy to pedal his bike on rough, uneven roads than on nice, paved, even roads, meaning he tires more quickly. Also, he is out of water, so there again he is using all his energy without any rehydration, further impacting his stamina and ability to continue. Therefore, the poor road conditions and lack of water combine to significantly hinder the cyclist's progress.
1004	6984	3	3	The life of a cyclist can be pretty complicated. So many things have to be prepared for you to be a successful cyclist. First, you have to be prepared for the weather. For example, when there are serious weather conditions like rain or snow, you have to be careful of icy roads. Also, what they have to be prepared for is long rides. Some rides might be from @NUM1 miles, so they have to bring plenty of food and water. Also, another affect that a cyclist has to face is the condition of the bike. For instance, he/she has to make sure the bikes are in good condition and is going to cooperate. Also, if work needs to be done to the bike then the bike can be worked on. Another affect of a cyclist is the cyclist's physical shape. For instance, if the cyclist is in shape, he/she is able to ride for a long period of time. Finally, another affect is the cyclist has to know where he/she is going. For instance, the man in the story didn't know where to go, so that's an important keypoint. In conclusion, being a cyclist requires careful planning and attention to various factors to ensure a safe and successful ride.
1005	6985	3	3	"The setting of where a cyclist takes their journey affects the cyclist. The reason I say that is because in the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" the cyclist came upon a conflict with the setting. The conflict was that it was very hot, and he did not use little things to survive, which he should have done, like drinking enough water. These are the reasons why I say the setting of where a cyclist takes their journey matters, because it can directly influence their experience and well-being."
1006	6986	3	3	The setting in the short story; ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed speed Limitî greatly affects the cyclist. The rough terrain and blazing sun test him and make him suffer in ways he never imagined. One point, after the cyclist has been going for hours he notes, ìOver on long crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnít a mirageÖî this setting has caused the cyclist to become so dehydrated that he canít think clearly or trust his own senses. The cyclist knows the dangers of the setting around him; he understands the potential for sunstroke and exhaustion on this unforgiving path. As you can see the setting has a very strong affect on the cyclist.
1007	6987	3	3	The cyclist was affected by long hours of riding the bike into the areas where he had never been, experiencing fatigue and unfamiliar terrain.
1008	6988	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.î The cyclist is affected by the setting mently and physicly. For example the setting affected the cyclist mently because it all was dessert and sand with no water. He thought he was going to die, he said ìI was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.î If he had some water he would not have thought this. The lack of resources in the harsh environment contributed to his mental distress. Also the cyclist was affected phyisicly because the road was rough it looked as it could go on forever. He was losing energy and was getting tired from riding up all the hills with little water left in him. It was hot and it seemed hopeless but if he was riding through the evergreen forest I donít think he would have felt this way. The physical demands of the terrain, coupled with dehydration, took a toll on his body. In conclusion the cyclist was effected by the setting phyisicly and mently if he had not been riding in the desert he would not feel this way. The environment played a crucial role in shaping both his physical and mental state.
1009	6989	3	3	"In the essay, ìRough Road ahead"" the character sees many settings through his ride, all of which affect his mood and physical condition. For example, when the author describes one place he came to as, ìone ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldnít hold in the lamest mute greeted me. This sight was troublingî, this was the turning point where the cyclist began to worry. He was running out of water, ìThe sun was beginning to beat downî, and he was probably tired of pedaling after hours in the saddle. But, to make matters worse, he came to rolling hills that stretched endlessly. This affected him because he had to work harder, straining his muscles with each uphill climb, and he had less water to pick him up and keep him going. When he finally got to a ìmodernizedî town, a stark contrast to the desolate landscape before, his spirits were lifted, and he was able to get water to cool him down and replenish his dwindling supply. This gave him more strength and will-power to continue his trip to Yosemite park, showing how a change in environment can greatly impact one's resolve."
1010	6990	3	3	The setting of the story has a huge affect because it was such an empty terrain that made him rely on only himself because of the lack of others to help. The harsh, desolate landscape offered no respite. For example, if he was riding through a city for hours he could stop and take a break in a store or get water from about any where. But being in the desert it really tested his inner strength to go on and get to safety. The unforgiving environment stripped away any external support, forcing him to confront his own limitations and ultimately showcasing the resilience of the human spirit when pushed to its absolute limit.
1011	6991	3	3	In the essay I can conclude that there were many features of the land that affected the cyclist. For example in the text it states “ridiculously large snake…blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” If you are greatly afraid of snakes that could ruin your whole trip. The cyclist was scared but overcame the fear and moved on. Also another thing that changed the cyclist was the lack of water. Not having enough water could be bad. As stated “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…” This illustrates how the environment posed real physical threats. There are many features that affected the cyclist and his journey.
1012	6992	3	3	In Joe Kurmaskieís, ìRough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî there are several features that effect the cyclist. ì..and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in Juneî (Kurmaskie). Deserts in June are extremely hot and dry, causing the cyclist to become dehydrated quickly, demanding diligent hydration to combat the arid climate. ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î The change from flat lands to hills made the ride more strenuous on the cyclist, increasing the physical demands and testing the cyclist's endurance. These environmental and geographical conditions directly impact the cyclist's experience and require careful consideration for a successful journey.
1013	6993	3	3	The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was riding through the deserts in June. The cyclist barely had water at the end of the stony trail. A lot of buildings were abandoned, right when he needed water most. That is how the harsh setting affected him, leaving him dehydrated and desperate.
1014	6994	3	3	"In the essay rough road ahead the setting does effect the cyclist because he has been pedaling for so long and he is becoming dehydrated. “I had been hitting my watter bottles pretty regularly. I was in the @LOCATION1” where the sun beat down relentlessly. Another reason the setting effects him is because he is starting to see mirages. “A sandblasted picture of a boy pouring a refreshing glass of grape juice into his mouth could still be seen,"" a cruel trick played by the desert heat reflecting off the faded sign, further emphasizing the harshness of his environment. The unforgiving landscape contributes to his physical and mental struggle."
1015	6995	3	3	"The features like not enough water and not enough sense of direction affect the cyclist because he needs water to keep pedaling. He needs maps to know what direction and where he is going. From not enough water, he said, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a lost entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and their keen sense of direction."" He then made a mental note to change that paragraph. That statement implied that the old men's sense of direction was out of date, suggesting they did not know where anything was, just there in their giant porch. This reveals the cyclist's reliance on updated information and resources, highlighting the challenge of navigating without sufficient water or accurate directions, ultimately hindering his progress and safety."
1016	6996	3	3	The features of the setting is that it is hot and dry. The way that it affects the cyclist is that he gets very hot and he drinks almost all of his water, and he only has about @NUM1 sips left when he gets to the other town. It also effects him because he had an advantage. The advantage that he had was he left before the sun came up, so then he had a time to get cool. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is when he gets even some of the hills he gets a little bit of the wind. Also, when the cyclist was thirsty, he put pebbles into his mouth, trying to stimulate saliva production to alleviate his thirst. In conclusion, the harsh, arid environment significantly impacts the cyclist's journey, testing his endurance and resourcefulness.
1017	6997	3	3	Setting plays a crucial part in the cyclistís mood and energy. For example, in a cool day riding gently downhill, the rider is happy and energetic. However, ìtraveling through the high deserts of California in June is not the best environment for laughs and ease. The cyclist in the story was hot exhausted, and hydrated. He thought, ìI was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.î The scorching sun beat down, and the endless expanse of sand and scrub offered no respite. Where the cyclist rides can have a huge effect on the cyclist himself, influencing not just physical state but also mental fortitude. The environment can either uplift or utterly break a cyclist.
1018	6998	3	3	The cyclist was riding his bike and was trying to get to Rosemite, and he had a lack of water, but he went on anyway. He had to go past a snake on the path, and he got scared.
1019	6999	3	3	All the features of the settings affect his rhythm, determination, and will to win because it sets him off his goal a little bit when he should just try to ignore stuff the best he can. Instead of thinking about it, like the crowd's noise or the course's difficulty, he gets distracted. If I was him I would just ride my bike & think about one thing: winning! By focusing solely on the finish line and visualizing success, he could minimize the impact of external factors and maintain his competitive edge, ultimately increasing his chances of victory.
1020	7000	3	3	To a cyclist, the surrounding setting can either cause triumph or despair. The cyclist was given very old directions. He was given back roads that are abandoned now. These towns had no people in them normally that would not matter, but he was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The June sun beat down relentlessly. If there was shade, a breeze, and cooler weather, he would be fine, but he is pedaling a bike in a desert during the summer. A ghost town with no good water could have killed him, as dehydration in that heat is a serious threat. A cyclist needs to know their surroundings and be prepared for what nature throws at them, making planning and awareness crucial for survival.
1021	7001	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. First of all I think that when the cyclist came across the ""ghost town"" he felt alone and discouraged, as the emptiness amplified his isolation. I think he felt like he was never going to find his way and there was no one there to help him, heightening his sense of vulnerability. Also the long hilly highway with nothing but desert on either side basically gave him the discouraging feeling that that road was never going to end and there was no way out of what he had started, making his journey seem insurmountable. I think it made him feel trapped and it was so dry that there was no water in sight and it made him feel so much thirstier than he was, pushing him to his physical limits. Overall I think that it had really physical and psychological effects on him, influencing his stamina and resolve during this difficult journey."
1022	7002	3	3	In the story ìDo not exceed posted speed limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist runs into a couple obstacles and they affected him in many ways. In the story the cyclist is riding a bike for miles. ìtumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.... in my dehydrated state.î This quote only lists a few of his problems. He had tumbleweed, a snake and he was dehydrated, making his ride exceptionally challenging. He had to stick pebbles in his mouth because he heard that they take away your dehydration, a desperate attempt to alleviate his physical distress. All through out the story he ran into many problems or obstacles but overcame them very well, showing his resilience. These setbacks highlight the physical and mental toughness required for such an endurance feat, ultimately showcasing his ability to persevere despite adversity.
1023	7003	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. Some of these features include: the heat, dangerous animals, not a lot of civilization, and the terrain. In the essay, each of these features were spoke of and they all affected the cyclist in a negative way. For example, when the cyclist headed from the intense heat, he needed to find a town. The first “town” he found he described as a “ghost town.” It took a while to find another town and he had been hitting his water bottles pretty regularly and he was travelling through the high deserts of California in June so he was getting really dehydrated and ready to collapse. The flat road being replaced by short, rolling hills wasn’t helping either. The terrain really affected the energy he had to exert in order to keep going, along with being dehydrated the cyclist had to deal with dangerous animals. During his journey “a ridiculously large snake blacked the majority of the road” which worried him it could have bitten him. The features of the setting definitely affected the cyclist in many ways.
1024	7004	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, the heat made the cyclist overheated, causing dehydration. For instance, the weather was sunny in June, with temperatures soaring above 90 degrees. Also, the hills made the cyclist very tired and slowed their pace significantly. For example, the cyclist was losing energy and had to keep pushing against the steep inclines, feeling the burn in their legs. Lastly, the setting had no places that could have helped the cyclist to rest or resupply. For instance, the cyclist had trouble finding a place with water to drink or any shade to escape the sun. In conclusion, the setting affected the biker in a very negative way, hindering their progress and physical well-being.
1025	7005	3	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in the way that it is so hot that he is quickly becoming dehydrated. The relentless sun beats down on the asphalt, radiating heat that saps his energy and dries his throat. Another feature is that all the buildings seem to be either abandoned or in despair. Windows are boarded up, paint is peeling, and a general sense of decay hangs in the air, further amplifying the cyclist's feeling of isolation and vulnerability. The harsh environment, therefore, not only threatens his physical well-being but also contributes to a growing sense of unease.
1026	7006	3	3	The features of the setting strongly affect the cyclist. Now the setting is in the California desert on a hot day, which causes the cyclist to drink all of his water, ultimately leaving him dehydrated and struggling. The barren desert with no landmarks causes the cyclist to become lost, exacerbating his situation and presenting the main problem for the cyclist. These harsh environmental factors combine to create a perilous scenario.
1027	7007	3	3	"The setting of this story plays a huge part in the final outcome. The author makes a mention that he is travelling through the high deserts of California in June. This sentence alone tells the reader that it is hot. And not hot by @LOCATION2 standards, where it gets to @NUM1 degrees, maybe, by noon. That means that the day starts at @NUM2. By noon, it's past @NUM3. Also, the author comes to a sign marked ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" @CAPS1 he makes note that heís only going 12 mph. Before he reaches any sort of civilization, he has already drunken most of his water, his last ""tentalizing sips,"" This is his main problem, his lack of water, which, combined with the harsh desert environment, creates a life-threatening situation. He drank most of it in the beginning of his ride, thinking heíd be okay, but he regretted it later on. Therefore, the extreme heat and isolation of the desert significantly contribute to the protagonist's predicament, emphasizing the importance of resource management in such an unforgiving environment."
1028	7008	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was in the middle of almost nowhere dehydrating. There were no signs for resting areas where you can find water fountans around. The cyclist put pebbles in there mouth to try and forget about being thirsty. Her surroundings were bumpy so she swallowed one. She just kept going and her words were “I was going to die.” First the cyclist was in danger of dehydrating, and end her satisfaction. The desolate landscape offered no respite. The cyclist made it alive as she saw Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp. Her setting was very clear until then. The cyclist was then relieved and made it alive, proving how crucial the environment is to survival and well-being.
1029	7009	3	3	Because he is dehydrated, the setting makes him worse. He’s biking, in California, in Death Valley. It’s not air-conditioned and the sun is probably scorching. The heat plus all the biking he’s doing, is making him even more thirsty and tired. This combination of exertion, dehydration, and the extreme desert environment clearly exacerbates his already difficult situation.
1030	7010	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist had been riding on the “high deserts of California in June,” suggesting intense heat and dryness that would challenge their endurance. The cyclist also saw a “ridiculously large snake,” introducing an element of danger and isolation. “There was no signs of civilization for miles.” There was “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” further emphasizing the cyclist's solitude and vulnerability. The cyclist went through many different obstacles traveling, trying to get to Yosemite. I think the settings affected the cyclist in many ways, contributing to a physically and mentally demanding journey.
1031	7011	3	3	Features of the setting affect cyclists greatly. Things like weather, terrain, temperature, and altitude can make or break a cyclist. In this essay, the heat, radiating off the asphalt like a furnace, and the relentless hills on the road challenge the cyclist. Each uphill climb burns his leg muscles, and the sun beats down on his helmet. He just keeps going through, pushing through the pain and exhaustion, one pedal stroke at a time, until eventually he gets to civilization, a small town with shade trees and a welcoming diner. This arduous journey lets you know that you can’t let mother nature control you; your will and determination can overcome even the toughest environmental obstacles.
1032	7012	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The author is getting worn out and is rapidly running out of water. He was traveling through the high deserts of California in June, with the sun beating down relentlessly and little shade to offer respite. This shows how the setting is causing him to become greatly exhausted. The oppressive heat and arid landscape conspire to drain his energy and resources, highlighting the profound impact of the environment on his physical state.
1033	7013	3	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist tremendously. According to the text, the cyclist was confident he would make the eighteen miles until he passed through the flat round, that was replaced by short rolling hills. He said and I quoted ìI toiledonî he sounds like itís hopeless, that he wasnít going to make it. The shift from the easy flat terrain to the more challenging hills clearly sapped his initial optimism. As you can see the setting does effect the cyclist.
1034	7014	3	3	The setting of ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî was very hot deserts. On a bike ride there are not many places to stop for food or water. On a bike ride you cant bring a lot of luggage with you. Only important materials and a big enough jug of water. An example from the text to show how bad it was out there: ìI got down on my hands, and knees, working the handle of the rusted pump with all my strength. He was so thirst and tired he didnít know how else to get some waterî. The extreme conditions highlight the challenges faced when resources are scarce, emphasizing the importance of careful planning and conservation during such journeys.
1035	7015	3	3	"In this setting the young man is faced by some challenges that make him as an individual a stronger person. For example, he was proud of himself; he made himself happy by saying at the end, ""Yes sir! I own a very good map."" He knows that he got through the heat, dry air, snakes, and a low supply of water to get to where he was determined to be: Yosemite. It was a difficult journey, but one that ultimately reinforced his self-belief and resilience. Having overcome these obstacles, he emerged with a deeper understanding of his own capabilities. Thus, his triumphant declaration about owning a very good map reflects not just possession, but also his successful navigation of adversity."
1036	7016	3	3	"The setting in the story ìDo not exceed posted speed limit"" affects the cyclist because itís a dry area in California in June. The cyclist really needs water, which is the main thing affecting him, besides the fact that heís lost in a ghost town. Therefore, the lack of water and misleading directions are the main features displayed, highlighting the harsh environment's impact and the disorientation it causes."
1037	7017	3	3	"The feature of the cyclist was very good ìit erodding to who he say in paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1î. I would describe it as fun. It also looks like this time was one of his best times. Here are some examples: he is happy, competitive, and his being is full. Iím going to explain my examples. First, he looks happy because in the story he said ìthe morning with strong legs and smile on my face.î This phrase can show you how happy he felt. My second example was competitive; he seems like a competitive person, because he is very healthy and led to take a ride from the bike. My third example is the way he is because he said ""As easily as sounding bond, my trouble, thirst and fears were all behind me,"" the part made me feel that way. Therefore, these qualities showcase a compelling and enjoyable character."
1038	7018	3	3	In the story ìDo Not Exceed posted speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. We can tell because the author writes ìthat road was replaced by short, rolling hillsî (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This tells us that cyclist is hard to ride on the road, demanding more physical exertion. The speed limit also affects the cyclist. When the speed limit sign appears, the character feels ìlife can feel so cruelî (kurmaskie @NUM1). This tells us that the character cannot achieve his goal of covering ground quickly and the signs serve as a frustrating reminder of external constraints. The challenging road conditions and speed limit signs ultimately impact the cyclist's experience and his ability to progress.
1039	7019	3	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the beginning, the setting was at the old man's place, and the cyclist was happy and confident, feeling prepared for the journey ahead after the old man's hospitality. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water, he was upset and frustrated, the desolate landscape mirroring his dwindling hope. When he saw the building, he was relieved, thinking his ordeal was over. But when he found out it was abandoned, he was sad, the empty structure symbolizing his dashed expectations. When he finally reached the store, he was excited and relieved, the prospect of supplies and rest bringing a surge of positive emotion. Therefore, it is evident that the changing settings directly influenced the cyclist's emotional state throughout his trip.
1040	7020	3	3	"In the story, ""Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, in the beginning of the story it says that, ""The sun was beginning to beat down,"" the temperature was beginning to rise, but it had not really affected the cyclist because he had plenty of water supply, and the sun was not at its peak intensity. Next the story says, ""I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June,"" California's temperature is really high and June is one of the hottest months of the year, making it a grueling time to cycle. The temperature was very high and the cyclist did not have much water left, further exacerbating the harsh conditions. This was affecting the cyclist because he was tired, hot, and getting dehydrated, impacting his physical state. Finally, at the end of the story the terrains were changing and there had been more hills and a road that was not as smooth as pavement because it was a dirt road and the hills were making the cyclist have to cycle harder to go past making him very tired. Also the temperature was still very high and he did not have barely any water left, pushing him to his limits. By the end of the ride the setting of roads, temperature and the distance of the ride had made the cyclist exhausted and dehydrated."
1041	7021	3	3	In the short story ìRough road ahead .Do not exceed posted speed limit ,î the cyclist faced many difficulties. These difficulties were the result of the setting. The story takes place in ìthe high deserts of California in June ì. Because the month June is very warm, and the climate of California is usually hot and dry, the cyclist ran into problems. The scorching sun beat down relentlessly, exacerbating his thirst and fatigue. Not only did this affect the cyclist, but he was also travelling through the desert. The setting also included several abandoned towns along the way, which contributed to the problem. The cyclist soon ran out of water, and discovered the towns that lay before him were unoccupied, offering no respite. He had no choice but to continue with his journey, battling the harsh elements and the desolation of the landscape. Ultimately, the challenging environment shaped the cyclist's arduous experience.
1042	7022	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One way is the hilly terrain makes him work harder and wears him out physically. Since the cyclist is getting worn out, he needs to drink more and more water to replenish his fluids. Now that he's drinking more water, he's running out of it faster and wanting more and more of it to quench his thirst. Then, when he starts to use less water to conserve it until he gets to the next town, he starts to become dehydrated and more tired, and he starts to feel weak and lethargic. Also, because the terrain is hilly, his leg muscles are working harder to propel him up the hills, and his legs become tired and start to ache. It also starts to get hotter as the day progresses, and he gets thirsty more often, compounding his dehydration. That is how the setting, through its physical demands and environmental conditions, significantly affects the cyclist's physical state and resource management.
1043	7023	3	3	In the poem “Do not exceed speed limit” the setting is described as very rough and dry. The man on the bike says he was running low on water, emphasizing the arid conditions. At some point he says “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake,” further illustrating the dry, empty landscape with a potentially harmful snake present. The sign which read “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” also contributed to the harsh environment, making it difficult for the man to ride and navigate the terrain. These environmental factors significantly affected the biker in the story, creating a challenging and uncomfortable journey.
1044	7024	3	3	The feature of it is the landscape, the characters, the plot, the end, and the beginning. These elements work together to create a cohesive and impactful narrative experience, shaping the reader's understanding and emotional response to the story. The setting, with its unique geography and atmosphere, grounds the story in a specific time and place. The characters, with their motivations and relationships, drive the action forward. The plot, with its twists and turns, keeps the reader engaged. The ending provides resolution and closure, while the beginning sets the stage for everything that follows. Ultimately, it is the interplay of these core features that determines the overall effectiveness and lasting impact of the work.
1045	7025	3	3	"The setting in ""Do Not @CAPS1 Posted speed limits"" affects the mood of the cyclist in that every time the setting changes, the mood of the cyclist changes. In the beginning of the story, the cyclist is riding through the ""cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite."" @CAPS2 At this time the cyclist is enjoying his trip and is in a positive mood, reveling in the beauty around him. As the story goes on, ""there was no one in sight, not a building, a car, or structure of any land."" At this point in the story, the cyclist has exchanged his positive mood for a desperate one as his water begins to run out, and the isolation starts to weigh heavily on him. Thus, the stark shift in setting directly correlates to the shift in the cyclist's emotional state."
1046	7026	3	3	The setting in the essay ìRough Road Aheadî makes the biker's travel a very difficult challenge that he has to overcome. When the ìflat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,î the biker must use more energy to peddl up the hills, straining his muscles and cardiovascular system. This made it hard on him to overcome his exhaustion of physical endurance. Also, he states that he was ìtraveling through the high desert of California in Juneî this weather is very hot and dry, therefor causing him to quickly run low on water, crucial for maintaining bodily functions. And, because he was in the desert, there was no sign of towns or people or salvation of any type. These desolate conditions heightened the biker's sense of isolation and vulnerability. These conditions made it hard on the biker because he knew if he dropped from dehydration, no one would be around to save him. In conclusion, these hard conditions challenged the biker a great deal.
1047	7027	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was on a very long bike ride to Yosemite National Park. However, on the way there, he had to cross through a desert like terrain. The blistering sun had been beating on his back for many miles. All the heat built up a desire for him to get water. He had been very tired, his muscles aching with each rotation of the pedals. The terrain had made him drenched in sweat. If it wasnít so hot, then he wouldnít of had that much of a hard time. The desert contains a very high temperature, which makes it harder to endure physical activities, especially long distance cycling. Even if you are to have a high endurance, the heat will make you very tired, and you will lose a lot of energy. Also, it didnít help anything, that the elderly men, had gave him terrible directions. He ended up taking a detour, which added extra miles to his journey, exacerbating his fatigue and dehydration. That is why I think the setting affected the cyclist. The harsh environment and poor guidance significantly compounded the challenges he faced, ultimately making his journey far more difficult.
1048	7028	3	3	The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” affect the author in a big way. The features of the setting are that “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The fact that there was nothing around him made the author lose hope and trust. After the author saw the old juice factory, he briefly felt like something was happening in his favor. Then he saw that it was abandoned, and he lost all hope. He shows his loss of hope again when he talks about how he’s going to die. He shows that he’s lost trust in the old men when he talks about never accepting advice from “old-timers who haven’t left their porches since Carter was in office.” In conclusion, the features of the directions he was given, and the desolate landscape, contribute to the author's growing despair and loss of any hope of surviving.
1049	7029	3	3	At the beginning of the ride, the cyclist is feeling good and strong and the day as well as the journey, is just beginning. The sun begins to beat down on the cyclist but he remains upbeat, still feeling good and barely noticing the heat. When he arrives at an old rusty water pump, he feels disappointed and tastes a liquid that resembles ìbattery acid.î The terrain begins to feel like more of a hill, which makes the struggle even worse. The cyclist is drinking water more now, and is becoming tired. He comes to a rough road and says, ìsometimes life can feel so cruel,î which lets the reader know he is feeling the negative affects of what he presumed to be a nice bike ride, a snake blocks his path and he becomes dehydrated. The cyclist feels refreshment and relief at a sign for a fish camp, and his thirst is replenished when he takes a satisfying gulp of water in the restroom. The water is a feature of the setting that refreshes the cyclist, while the hot sun, rough terrain, and unknown area are features that make the cyclist feel lost and tired, illustrating how environmental factors can dramatically impact one's physical and emotional state.
1050	7030	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the sand and the intense heat are two big parts of the setting, which make him thirsty. ""… followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This quote explains the intense heat the cyclist is feeling, further emphasizing the harshness of his environment. The sun is another big feature that affects him, likely causing sunburn and further dehydration. This is how the setting affects the cyclist."
1051	7031	3	3	The feature effect the cyclist because he wants to go somewhere spectacular and amazing. Like for example, he said he was thriving on this one spot forever and he finally got there and it was a ghost town and he chuckled and rode away because it wasn’t what he was looking for, showing his disappointment. I believe that this guy is judging every place he goes by the way it looks and not by what it has to offer; like he doesn't believe in getting direction from an old map, but yet he still took it. I believe that he wants to get where he wants to go and not let anybody get in his way, no matter what; it's like he is looking for a perfect spot and he thinks when he finds it he will be filled with stories, suggesting his journey is fueled by a desire for exceptional experiences. Ultimately, his focus on aesthetics over substance shapes his decisions and actions as he seeks his ideal destination.
1052	7032	3	3	The setting can affect a cyclist in many ways; if it were hot out, he would be thirsty and sweaty. If there were hills, the cyclist would be tired as well as thirsty. The cyclist, although thirsty and tired, is determined to get through and find a town. The cyclist said, “I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” By saying this, he knows that he can make it that far and is determined to do so, demonstrating mental fortitude. With the challenging terrain causing even more trouble for him, it would make it more difficult, but he knows that he must overcome his challenging activity, and he still keeps a strong spirit. Ultimately, with that strong spirit, he can do just about anything because he has the encouragement he needs to push through and achieve his goal.
1053	7033	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his mood change. In the shaded woods, where itís nice, shaded, and cool, he feels fairly good. Heís excited and ready to take on the adventure of a new path. Heís still in a good mood when he comes to the first town. As he moves on, and his water supply deplets, his mood sinks lower and he becomes more frustrated with the growing heat and relentless sun. In the ironic twist of fate that he finds a Welchís Grape Juice, Factory, a mirage of refreshment that offers no actual water, he is about to quit. He is dejected and almost ready to admit defeat against the harsh landscape. But he forces himself to go on, driven by some stubborn inner will, and when he finally reaches a place with water, his relief is mixed with wariness of the old man sitting on the porch. He will never take water for granted or advice from old men ever again, his experience forever shaping his perspective.
1054	7034	3	3	The features of the setting only drain the cyclist's willpower. The things he sees discourage him, for example one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the largest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. The desolation begins to wear away his hope of finding a building or town, sometimes the things are psychologically damaging. In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it – had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. For someone who is quickly running out of water, this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue. The snake and rolling hills slow him down, and make him use more energy, demanding more water. The heat dehydrates the cyclist even faster, baking the cracked earth around him. The environment is a hostile one for a cyclist, relentlessly chipping away at his determination and pushing him closer to his breaking point.
1055	7035	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First the climate affected him the most; that's so because he became too hot, drank a lot of water trying to compensate, and then became dehydrated as he couldn't replenish his fluids fast enough. So he had no energy because of dehydration, making the physical exertion even harder. Another one is the built of the road. That's so because it was rocky, bumpy, winding, with hills; being dehydrated, the rough terrain sapped his strength and the road was very tempting to just give up and die on. Then the heat got to him because there was no shade to offer respite, no water left to cool him down, and the sun just beating down on him, further accelerating his dehydration and exhaustion, showing how the environment conspired against his efforts.
1056	7036	3	3	During the cyclist trail there are many factors that play out to be disadvantages to him/her. There are rough roads, bad water pump, abandoned battling plant, and the long lasting truth that it wasnít even his path. All of these factors create something new in the cyclist. As the cyclist recover the first town and realizes it is decreased he is initially amused. He then pedals on, but realizes his water is running low. Then, what is originally a sign of hope because another let down: a water pump found just in time, but the water is no longer any determination they reach ìrough roadsî creating, once again, a more painful journey. Finally, the cyclist sees a building in the distance, but again, deserted. The only goodness as the poor cyclist is when they came along a bait ìtar, some sign of civilization that keeps him alive. Hope after hope arises to the end in turmoil upon turmoil. These encounters would cause oneself to become persimistic on even a task, but he sought through. These encounters create an interesting meal. Every time you catch word on hope you become entitled to what could happen next and then feel sorry for the cyclist after having hope on multiple occasions. The steady and solid rising plot keeps the reader entitled wanting more, invested in the cyclist's journey and resilience despite constant setbacks.
1057	7037	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the bad condition roads. The roads were bumpy and uneven, making it difficult to maintain speed and control. There were also hills so they made it harder for the cyclists. The inclines demanded more energy and stamina from the cyclists, ultimately impacting their overall performance.
1058	7038	3	3	ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kindî. This abandonedness makes it hard for the cyclist to find hope and assess where to get water. ìI could drop from a heat stroke in a gorgeous day in June,î he's in the desert in @LOCATION1 in June with little water around; no one is around, this makes him very desperate since he's abandoned. The sun beats down relentlessly, and the shimmering heat waves only intensify his thirst and sense of isolation, heightening his desperation.
1059	7039	3	3	The main features that affected the cyclist were the rough terrain and the hot sun. The rough terrain, with its uneven surfaces and potential obstacles, made it harder to pedal and it tired the cyclist out faster. But also hindering progress was the hot sun because it would dehydrate him while he was riding, sapping his strength. So between the hard to pedal rough terrain and the dehydrating hot sun, the cyclist was very affected to the point of exhaustion.
1060	7040	3	3	The features of the setting in the essay, ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed limitî affect the cyclist. As the cyclist rides to his destination, he encounters obstacles and views his surroundings. The author gives the starting setting in the second paragraph as ìa reservoir campground outside of lodi, California an early. Summer evening.î The reader is informed that the temperatures are not in summers in California. This gives the cyclist his main conflict, the lack of water. With temperatures being high, it is easier to become quickly dehydrated, thus adding to the struggle. The author stated, ìThe sun was beginning to beat down and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Also, to cyclist encounters a ridiculously largeî snake in the middle of the rode. The reader is aware that there are many conflicts which one can encounter while cycling. There are finally many features of the setting that let the cyclist know where he currently is, and the place where he wants to be most, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite. In the essay, the cyclist is determined to reach Yosemite, and although he faces troubles, he doesnít give up and is relieved when he finally receives water, highlighting the importance of the setting in shaping his experience.
1061	7041	3	3	The features of the desert changed the way the speaker thought about his journey. When the road began to change, the speaker’s determination did too, ìFlat road were replaced by short hillsî. The terrain began to change and the speaker became doubtful of the old man that directed him towards the shortcut. ìI could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadnít been off their porch in decadesî. The heat in the desert made the speaker thirsty, causing him to drink all his water. There was no source of water therefore he decided to suck on a stone. ìIíd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirstî. But the bumpy terrain didn’t allow him to do that, as the rough path jostled him constantly. He hit a bump and swallowed the stone. The speaker began to panic, ìI was going to die and the birds would pick me cleanî. But luckily the author's thoughts changed after he found a supply of water, proving how much the challenging features of the desert affected the cyclist, influencing both his physical state and mental outlook on the trip.
1062	7042	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a very negative way due to the lack of buildings, people, and cars on his ìshortcutî he was in great doubt of his survival. The relentless sun beat down, and the cracked asphalt radiated heat, amplifying his distress. ìI was going to die, and the birds would pick me clean.î He thought he wouldnít get any water because there was nothing around him, just endless stretches of desolate landscape, and he thought he would die of dehydration or heatstroke. ìAnd the growing realization that I would die of heatstrokeî further cemented his despair, highlighting the harsh reality of his isolated predicament.
1063	7043	3	3	The setting of the story had affected the bike rider in many ways. It was hot when he was riding so he was thirsty. For example, “The sun was beginning to beat down” (pg @NUM1). So the sun is very exhausting and made him start dehydrating. Another example is “traveling through the desert of California in June” (pg @NUM2). California is a relatively hot state and June is one of its warmer months. The terrain didn’t favor the rider either; “Flat road had turned into short, rolling hills” (pg @NUM2). Short, rolling hills are harder on a biker's body than flat terrain. This combination of heat and difficult terrain demonstrates how the setting negatively affected the rider's experience and physical state.
1064	7044	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it was in June and it was starting to get hot. In the book, it said he was going through the desert. The heat rising off the sand made the air shimmer, further intensifying the harsh conditions. Also, the author did not have enough water to survive in the desert while the sun was beaming on him, making the journey increasingly perilous. The combination of intense heat and dwindling water supplies created a life-threatening situation for the cyclist.
1065	7045	3	3	In this paragraph I will explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting affect the cyclist in ways such as weather, road structure, & animals. For instance, rain can reduce visibility and make surfaces slippery, while potholes or gravel can cause accidents. Unpredictable animal crossings also pose a danger. All things that the cyclist could not controll. Therefor affecting the cyclist while he rides through.
1066	7046	3	3	The features of the setting in this story gives the cyclist determination. Since the desert stretched endlessly before him, an ocean of sand and sun, each mile marked only by the dwindling water in his pack, the sheer desolation fueled his resolve. The oppressive heat, shimmering off the dunes, became a challenge to overcome, a tangible enemy against which his will could be tested and ultimately triumph. The silence, broken only by the whirring of his tires and his own ragged breath, allowed him to focus solely on the present moment, on the next rotation of the pedals, solidifying his determination to reach the distant horizon.
1067	7047	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is very hot and it is summertime. The cyclist wouldn’t have gotten so tired and exhausted if he wasn’t in a “ghost town,” with the “sun beginning to beat down.” It was in Nevada during June, so it was very hot; the water was also 100 degrees! The text also states there were rolling hills and tumbleweeds, so it must have been a desert kind of area. The trip was also a very long one, “about forty miles into the pedal,” causing him to be tired and dehydrated. As you can see, the setting, with its intense heat and isolation, significantly contributed to the cyclist's exhaustion on this long desert ride.
1068	7048	3	3	The features of the setting are very important for cyclists. If the setting is wrong, they could be in many dangers, such as collisions with vehicles or pedestrians, or hazards due to poor road conditions. It is really important to have a clear setting, encompassing well-maintained roads, adequate lighting, and designated cycling lanes. By ensuring a safe and well-defined environment, we can significantly reduce the risks cyclists face and promote safer cycling practices.
1069	7049	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist horribly! For example, he ran into the worse problems and couldnt really do anything about them. Also, he started out fine, then he started to become dehydrated, which was a huge problem. He didnt have much water left and he was only @NUM1 miles up the road. A loss of water was very affective in June traveling through a desert. Also, the damage of the road was very affective too because hes on a bike and not too good of balance, and he nearly crashed several times due to the uneven terrain. These features could affect the cyclist in many ways because of the weather, temperature, loss of water, road damages and snakes. The cyclist was on a bike and couldnt really protect himself, and he was dehydrated, and tired, making his situation increasingly precarious. The convergence of these environmental factors clearly demonstrates how a challenging landscape can severely hinder even a prepared traveler.
1070	7050	3	3	Throughout his journey, the protagonist in the story encounters obstacles in the setting. First off, he is cycling in the hot, dry, desert. There is no civilization or natural water source, so he faces dehydration. Additionally, the terrain he was riding on proved difficult. He encountered rolling hills that took a lot of energy to ride up. There were even signs for ìrough road ahead.î Another obstacle was a mental obstacle. He came across an abandoned juice factory when he needed an occupied building. These were ironic and mentally frustrating. The cyclist must have lost hope in finding civilization after he found numerous abandoned examples of civilization. This discouragement must have made his journey more mentally challenging.
1071	7051	3	3	The features in the setting would affect the cyclist because they would want to have towns with water so they can restock their water. They would want water even more after going up hills, especially on a hot day. They would also want a place to get something to eat and maybe rest their legs, allowing them to continue their journey refreshed. These features are vital for a cyclist undertaking a long journey.
1072	7052	3	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because of the intense heat and lack of water. Also, the rough road ahead was a significant challenge. Another problem was the dry air, which would dehydrate him faster, and the presence of snakes everywhere in the desert added a constant threat. The hills were a big problem too because of the heat and no water, making them difficult to climb. Finally, the other problem was his despair, knowing he was likely going to die and that scavenging birds would eventually consume him, leaving nothing behind. This confluence of harsh environmental conditions and the cyclist's grim acceptance of his fate demonstrates how powerfully the setting affected the cyclist's physical and mental state.
1073	7053	3	3	The hot, dry, desert setting affects the cyclist in many different ways, ìI was traveling through the high deserts of California in Juneî (@NUM1). The cyclist is very hot. He was thirsty but, ìA tarlike substance ooted out, followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of zoo (@NUM2). The water was barely even water, so he didnít have much to drink until the next town, exacerbating his dehydration. ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hillsî (@NUM3). Flat road is much easier to bike on then hills, requiring less exertion. He was thirstier and more tired after biking on hills. ìA sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could still be seenî (@NUM4) on an old welchs grape fruit factory. This makes the cyclist envious of the young boy and the refreshment he's enjoying. It also discourages him, reminding him of what he lacks. In conclusion, the water being bad, the terrain change, the picture of the young boy, and the fact that the cyclist thirsts for drink makes him tired, hot, envious, and generally exhausted.
1074	7054	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has water and plenty of it, the setting seems to be smooth, easy riding. This means that he doesn’t have to use much water, but he still uses some because anyone that rides @NUM1 miles on a bike will need plenty of water no matter what the terrain is like. The features of the setting affect the cyclist toward the middle and end of his trip greatly because it gets rough and hilly and so he needs more water that he doesn’t have. And since he was planning on being able to get water at the first stop he didn’t conserve it as well, so this left less water for him to have when he really needed it. He then became dehydrated after his first stop, and he didn’t get any more water there so it caused him to dehydrate, hindering his progress significantly. So it seem that the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has plenty of water and doesn’t really need it the terrain is smooth and easy to ride but as he drinks his water the terrain gets rougher and worse. So the features of the setting affects him greatly in that they don’t help him they just get worse when he needs it to get better, ultimately exacerbating his challenge and testing his endurance.
1075	7055	3	3	There are many ways that the features affect the cyclist. One is that he is already scared to go up this really big hill. Another is that as he is going up this big hill it's hot, there are snakes, he's scared and tired. Almost all of his energy is gone, his legs burning with each rotation. He just wants to stop but he is determined to go up this hill, pushing through the pain. He also knows that it can't be that bad because he can just relax all the way back down, a small comfort that fuels his resolve.
1076	7056	3	3	"After reading, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” I noticed that the setting of this adventure affected the narrator. First of all, the heat caused the narrator to be uncomfortable and thirstier, as the sun beat down relentlessly. While on the move, he refers to the trip as a “water-depleting” one; this quote shows that he was lacking water and that this was a major problem, impacting his focus. Also it refers to the road as “rolling hills"", and this shows the reader that they seem to go on forever, creating a monotonous landscape. This lowers the narrator’s hope of getting there quickly, making the journey seem even longer. Also the desert gives the author low hope of reaching his destination, with its barrenness suggesting a lack of resources or respite. The setting affects the narrator both physically and mentally, impacting his well-being and outlook."
1077	7057	3	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist because it kept him going because he was all alone and had no help. First, just the fact that he was by himself kept his determination high. The isolation meant he had to rely solely on his own strength and resolve. If he would have had a partner they could have stopped and took a break or shared the water. Next, the fact that there were no buildings, houses or anything in sight affected him. The desolate landscape amplified his sense of isolation and the need to persevere. He got a bolt of strength just from seeing a building ahead. If there had been building he could have stopped and asked for more water and rested. The fact that he was in a desert in California in the middle of June really affected him. The intense heat and arid environment presented a constant physical challenge. He had no determination there because there was nothing he could do to better the situation in his cause. He even at one point felt that he might die. In conclusion the setting really affected the cyclist because it determined his endurance and will power.
1078	7058	3	3	"Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. For example, he asked the older guys, ""that haven't left their porches since Carter was in the office,"" where the next place was to get water. Also, he was out in the middle of nowhere. It was also in June where the weather was warm, and he didn't have a lot of water, which made the journey more challenging. The combination of isolation, heat, and limited resources created a difficult situation for the cyclist."
1079	7059	3	3	"Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, he was in ""high desert of California in June."" This affected him in many ways. It makes him become very dehydrated due to the intense heat. He had to conserve his water and chew on pebbles to get any spit to collect in his mouth, just to relieve his parched throat. Also, the road became very rough and uneven. The new terrain made him have to push himself harder and lose energy quicker as he struggled against the unyielding ground. The last feature would be the distance he had to travel. He had to travel a lot further than he had planned to. This again affected his energy and spirits with thoughts of possible death and not being able to make it to his destination alive. Those are just some of the ways the features of the setting affected the cyclist, both physically and mentally, testing his limits of endurance."
1080	7060	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Since the cyclist was in the middle of no where, he couldn’t get any water. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst,” he was so thirsty that he barely had any energy to keep going, “The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke,” it was hot out and he had no water so this affected his energy. He tried to recall how far the next town was, but his mind was hazy from the heat and exertion.
1081	7061	3	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist. The harsh terrain proved a challenge when his water supply was low and all towns had been abandoned, leaving him no refill. The relentless heat was also a significant factor, quickly creating weariness and fatigue. On the bike ride, he experienced a glimmer of hope at an old water pump but was quickly disappointed when the hot liquid tasted of battery acid. The setting, with its arid landscape and scarcity, set the conflict and helped achieve the tone the author was looking for to affect the cyclist, emphasizing his struggle against a desolate environment.
1082	7062	3	3	The settings effect the cyclist by the roughness of the ride. First, they go over a bunch of rocks, and the tire could pop. Next it could be smooth and easy, offering a welcome relief. Also, it could be far away from towns and difficult to get back, leaving the cyclist stranded. There could be a lack of water making you dehydrate, impacting performance and health. That is how the setting around the cyclist could effect him, highlighting the importance of preparation and awareness of the surrounding environment.
1083	7063	3	3	"The setting presented in the story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,"" would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summer’s day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, ""wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke"" (Kurmaskie). This shows how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories, adding to the desolate atmosphere. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high, considering the environmental factors and isolation. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those surroundings alive."
1084	7064	3	3	The desert area of California was making him dehydrated. The long trip required careful water management, and he had enough to reach his destination only if he took the mapped route. The old men, who he thought hadn't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office, told him a shortcut. He followed their advice and ended up almost dying from heat stroke and dehydration. If the cyclist would have followed the map, he could have stopped off at a store for more water, assuming the desert setting was as unforgiving as it proved to be. Ultimately, trusting the locals' ill-conceived shortcut jeopardized his journey and his health.
1085	7065	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting was a dry California desert, for if it had been a busting city, the events in the story would have not happened. The author asked a group of old men for directions to Yosemite National Park, and, ìlike a foolish youth,î followed their advice. Everything started out fine until he reached the second town. He ran almost dehydrated and ìin an ironic twistî he reached an abandoned grape juice factory. Almost all hope was lost for him until he rounded the bend and came across his new hope: ìGary and Wilberís Fish camp-if you want bait for the big ones, weíre your best bet.î In the end he learned to stick to a map instead of old people who ìhavenít left the confines of their porches, their car, or their office,î showing the importance of reliable navigation in such an unforgiving environment.
1086	7066	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because first he realized that getting advise from people that no longer drive or even leave of the porch would be unuseful. When the author say ìold timers who havenít lest the confined of them porches since carter was in officeî that what he is explaining, highlighting the disconnect between their outdated knowledge and his current experience. He then say ìI rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my faceî he was refering back to how hes on the rode alone riding the bike and theres not a car insight any where around, emphasizing the freedom and solitude he found. The curbs of the turns where so sharp that only a bicycle could make them as safe as he did ìHe whipped the sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasnít mirage and tried not get to excitedî This unique situation would have made many people excited about the long lonely cicle by his self. Ultimately, the setting, with its lack of traffic and challenging turns, contributed to the cyclist's excitement and sense of accomplishment.
1087	7067	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making his way to the Yosemite National Park a longer, more difficult, and dangerous way to go. He takes the dare of going that way, defying the warnings of some old folks that he says “haven’t gotten off their porches since Carter was in office.” Despite their potential wisdom, there would be a reason to disregard their advice, even though their experience might be valuable; the cyclist’s youthful exuberance and desire for adventure outweigh the perceived risks in his mind. Therefore, he continues undeterred, highlighting a generational difference in risk assessment and the allure of the unknown.
1088	7068	3	3	In the setting there are no cars and no buildings meaning no help available. The cyclist, weary and parched, was tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water. The relentless sun beat down as no one was around because it was the desert. The cyclist was dehydrated but kept going, driven by the hope of reaching his destination. The road was straight for a long while, but almost to the end there were many hills, testing his strength. Along with having to bike up the hills, his vision blurred from the heat, he almost ran into a snake, startled by its sudden appearance. The weather was hot and unforgiving; he had no water, he could have died if he didn't push through. Despite the odds, he persevered, his determination ultimately seeing him through the arduous journey.
1089	7069	3	3	"The features in the setting in the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" greatly affect the biker. For example, the heat is constantly drying the biker out, making the ride physically taxing. Also, at the first town, the old water pump proved to be a hopeless cause with water that tasted like ""battery acid"", offering no respite from the thirst. Even after that, there were more problems. There was a sign that posted a max speed limit, a cruel reminder of how slow he was going. The biker was doing about one-fifth of that speed. This affects his mood, and he realizes that it will be a long ride, both physically and mentally. The pebbles that he found help him out marginally. He remembers reading that sticking pebbles in your mouth calms your thirst, a small comfort in the vast landscape. Finally, the bait store gave him the relief that he needed at the end of his trip, marking the end of his struggle. In conclusion, the setting makes the rider's journey a difficult one, but in the end, the bait store had just what he needed, providing a welcome conclusion to his arduous journey."
1090	7070	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example, there were no towns close nearby. One reason this affected the cyclist is because if the towns were near each other and he ran out of water, there would be stores close by to replenish his supply. In addition, he could have a heatstroke and there would be no one around to get help from, and he could easily die from the exposure. In my point of view of the reading, I believe where he was located is what affected him mostly, because the scarcity of resources and isolation significantly amplified any potential risks he faced.
1091	7071	3	3	The hot weather is dehydrating the cyclist, who can’t find more water. The sun beats down relentlessly. The hills and rough terrain are draining the energy he has. Each uphill climb feels like a monumental effort. The heat is so intense he has to break the road down into smaller segments, focusing on the individual milestones he wants to get to. He gets drained physically and emotionally, the isolation amplifying the struggle. He has a hard journey, testing his limits and pushing him to his breaking point.
1092	7072	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist on how the nature of life he was hydrated or not. On the posts “Do not exceed posted speed limit” is after “wide rings of dried sweat clinched my thirst, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June”. This shows that he is dehydrated from the sun, a feature of the setting, leading to his physical distress. “a tarlike distance surged out, followed by cockish water feeling somelane in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This reinforces that the cyclist knows there is no accessible, drinkable water in this location, further emphasizing how the environment directly contributes to his dehydration and perilous situation.
1093	7073	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist from the essay ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, ìby Joe Kurmaskie had many obstacles to overcome. When he first showed the old men his map he was probably thinking to himself, ìmy gosh, what did I get myself into?!î Because the cyclist trusted the shortcut the old men told him about he had a lot of doubt, anger and determination later on during the day. The sun beating down intensified his frustration. It was really hot and he was running out of water making him worried he was going to get dehydrated and die because he was starting to think he was getting lost. The hills also affected the cyclist by making him tired and slowing his progress significantly. In conclusion, the cyclist, in the end, found a little store by all the determination and effort he put in.
1094	7074	3	3	The setting where the cyclist is at is in a desert, and it can affect him because he could get a heatstroke. The text states that he is lacking water and if you get too dehydrated it's not healthy and you die from it. However, when the wind is against his face, it can cool him down, along with the sweat. As long as he has some liquid left, it should be okay.
1095	7075	3	3	"The setting of this story is a dry, hot desert in the middle of June. These features of the setting effect the author, because it shows how he starts off strong and determined and is left weak and doubtful. In the beginning of the story, the author says, “Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” This is showing the reader the confidence he has with himself before starting his trip. Later on in the story, he describes the setting as “the high deserts of California in June.” He is describing the heat and what he is facing. It goes on to tell how he is dehydrated and worn out, highlighting the harsh conditions. But he comes to a town, ""cool water dripping from my head as I slumped against the wall."" He is relieved, demonstrating the impact of escaping the oppressive environment. As the setting changes, the author's attitude changes as well, illustrating how the environment can dramatically influence one's physical and mental state."
1096	7076	3	3	Different features of the setting affect a cyclist; for example, temperature really changes everything. If it’s too hot, you’re going to get tired really easily, due to increased perspiration and dehydration. Then again, if it's too cold, breathing gets really hard and muscles can stiffen. The biker in the story was in a desert area in June, so it was really hot and tiring, making hydration crucial. Also, the terrain affects a cyclist. If the road is filled with hills, getting up those hills is difficult, requiring more energy and strength. If it’s all downhill, it’s really easy, but all uphill is hard; level terrain is fairly easy, allowing for consistent speed. The cyclist in the story was in level terrain, then it turned into a lot of hills, which tired him out considerably, impacting his overall performance and endurance. Therefore, the environmental conditions and the landscape significantly determine the cyclist’s experience.
1097	7077	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because he is faced with roadways he is unsure of, making navigation difficult. The weather is hot and dry, which can lead to dehydration and exhaustion during his ride. Furthermore, the presence of wild animals poses a potential safety risk, adding to the challenges he must overcome. These environmental factors collectively impact his journey and well-being.
1098	7078	3	3	The setting has a great impact on the condition of the cyclist. First, it is a very hot dry in June, with the sun beating down mercilessly. The cyclist is maneuvering his way through high deserts in @LOCATION1, where the arid landscape stretches out before him. He comes across many steep hills that he must climb over, straining his muscles, and then carefully maneuver his way down the other side, testing his brakes and control. With all of these obstacles and the heat slowing him down considerably, sapping his energy, he will need water but is already low on his supply, making his situation increasingly precarious.
1099	7079	3	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the narrator is faced with the challenging and perilous desert he must cross. He wasn't traveling in a car, he was riding a bike, and crossing a desert on foot is tiring enough, let alone on a bike. ""The speed limit was 25. I was doing a water depleting 5. Sometimes life can be so cruel."" In the horrible 110 degree heat the narrator gulps down his water bottles at such a rate that he’s at risk of running out. Not only that, but he’s been pedaling for such a long time that he could pass out from exhaustion or, ""I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades."" So I would say the narrator was pretty hassled by his surroundings, and his journey was fraught with danger and discomfort."
1100	7080	3	3	"The setting affected the character in ways that would usually affect people. When he got into the first town he had ran out of water to drink but the town’s water he was in now tasted like battery acid so that’s not safe to drink. As he started to head out the scenery changed. “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is hinting at the fact that maybe this town he is going to be abandoned or not used. He saw a huge rattle snake and tumbleweed, which are usual signs of a desert, further isolating him. It was hard for him to keep his balance as he says, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” He ended up getting to the point where he had to put rocks in his mouth to trick his mind that he wasn’t thirsty anymore, a desperate measure highlighting the severity of his situation and the unforgiving nature of the environment."
1101	7081	3	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because at first he had to watch out for the snakes that usually crossed the roads, then the streets were crooked and bumpy, so the road structure throw him off a bit, and he was riding his bike in June and it was very hot, and he had lack of water so he thought he was going to have a heatstroke. These environmental factors significantly impacted the cyclist's energy and concentration. These things affected how the cyclist performed on his bike, ultimately hindering his speed and overall enjoyment of the ride.
1102	7082	3	3	"The cyclist is riding through the high deserts in California. In this environment everything looks the same for miles. The cyclist is dehydrated and is getting worse because he has no protection from the sun. It is hard for the cyclist to keep in good spirits because he is not even coming across any towns or sources of water. The cyclist says “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’"" This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This made the cyclist doubt the old timers directions. In the wide open desert, the cyclist was only coming across something after at least twenty miles. The heat, lack of water, and lack of civilization made the cyclist think he was “going to die and the birds would pick [him] clean."" When the cyclist spots the abandoned Welch’s factory, the cyclist says they used what seemed to be their last bit of energy. The conditions affected the cyclist, and the cyclist found it hard to remain positive given the circumstances of the challenging desert terrain."
1103	7083	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist by showing that he is a little angry. He states that “I don’t remember the saying ‘don’t take candy from strangers.’” So we know he is upset about something. He is mad about the fact that this one older man tells him directions on how to get somewhere, and it’s wrong, and the man figures that out halfway through the story. He also said that “the old man hasn’t been off his porch since Carter was in office,” so he needs to get his directions up to date. It is clear that the cyclist's frustration is fueled by the outdated advice, leading to a negative attitude at the beginning of his journey.
1104	7084	3	3	In the story ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî the settings affected the character because he thought he wouldnít make it to the park because of the way things looked around him. The desolate landscape, with its implication of danger, heightened his anxiety about time. Because of the rolling hills and snakes he didnít think he would make it any where and thought he was going to die. Thatís how the setting affected the character, creating a sense of foreboding that significantly influenced his perception and actions.
1105	7085	3	3	"While the cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park he listened to some old men who gave him directions for a shortcut. When he began his trip everything was fine. But then he found that along the ""shortcut"" there was no building. By the time he figured out that the old men were mistaken, he had almost run out of water. There was nothing around that he could drink, not even a puddle. He was getting very thirsty. The fact that he was in the deserts of California in June didn't make his task any easier, as the sun beat down relentlessly. About halfway through his ride he ran into rolling hills, which made his trip even harder, forcing him to dismount and push his bike. Towards the end he found a building and he used all of his strength to get to it, just to find that it was an abandoned juice factory. This made going without water much harder, as well as he gazed at the picture of the boy who was drinking juice on a faded billboard. In the end he finally made it to a paint shop where he guzzled all the water he possibly could, finally quenching his desperate thirst."
1106	7086	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. For example when he was riding on the road he would pick a destination and ride to it. Then he would take a break. If this destination was a building he would be strong willed and determined, pushing himself to reach the solid structure. If it looked like their was nothing ahead but hills, he would just ride and wait to fall over dead without a care in the world, the endless slopes sapping his motivation. Ultimately, the landscape dictated not just his route, but his very spirit.
1107	7087	3	3	One ramsackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnít hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubled and forlorn. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind to break the desolate landscape. With any luck, Iíd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. Rough road ahead if he didnít take the old mans advice; he would have enjoyed his bike ride if he had heeded the warning, and he needed a new map to navigate this forsaken place.
1108	7088	3	3	The features in the story affect the cyclist by not having anything to drink. The person was going to a place far away without any food or water for miles, and this lack of sustenance could have been deadly. There is another feature that affects the cyclist, and that is the isolation, with no one around for miles. If he collapsed out there, no one would know for days, delaying any potential rescue. I know this because in the story he said, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind.” That says it all about the desolation of the location. The last feature is that it was hot. I know this because it says, “I was traveling through high deserts of California in June.” It is hot in June, and it is even hotter in California, and the heat makes the journey significantly more dangerous due to the risk of dehydration and heatstroke, compounding the lack of available water. These environmental factors create a precarious situation for the cyclist.
1109	7089	3	3	"People who travel will almost always encounter difficulties. For the main character in this story, this is very true. His first mistake was when he took directions from the ""old-timers""; by doing that, he travelled extremely far out of his way. In the story he talked to the old men on the porch. He said, ""what I shouldn't have done was to let them see my map"". Another problem he faced was when he began to run out of water. This caused a problem for him because of dehydration. In the story he said, ""The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips."" Also, another problem he encountered was the desert area that he was riding through. This caused a problem for him because there wasn't anybody around to help him if he needed it. In the story he says, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, cars, or structure of any kind."" By reading this story, we’ve realized that people encounter problems everywhere; however, any problem, no matter what size, can be overcome, as the main character's resilience shows us the possibility of triumphing over the challenges that arise during travel."
1110	7090	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because on page @NUM1 it talks about how the cyclist had to go down a hill then find a factory for juice. If the cyclist didn't find any building, he would have kept going down the hill and wasted the little bit of energy for later. Ultimately, the setting directly influences the cyclist's resource management and route.
1111	7091	3	3	Since the cyclist was really thirsty, the setting was not very appealing considering it was a desert. You could tell she was stressing because she was sweating and having a trouble time trying to pedal; each rotation felt heavier than the last, a testament to her growing exhaustion and the unforgiving heat.
1112	7092	3	3	The setting effects the cyclist in away that most people canít tell cycling forty miles on maybe a gallon of water is hard expecialy in California ìI had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in Juneî The effect on his body would be rather devastating, potentially leading to severe dehydration and exhaustion, given the intense heat and physical exertion involved.
1113	7093	3	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in that when he is riding he has very little water. Also he takes advice from old men, and he meets up with a Snake and he goes down a dirt road; he has no water at the time there. The conclusion is that he comes off the dirt road and joins the main road that he travels. Also he promised to stick to it in the future. That is how you should stick to things in the future.
1114	7094	3	3	The biker has many features in his story. For example he has descriptive words that put pictures into my head. For example “One long, crippling hill” I can picture it in my head. “There was no one in sight.” All of these parts of the story put pictures in my head. That’s a good thing, for example you want the reader to understand it, and by having describing words it helps bring the scene to life.
1115	7095	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One way is that the ìrolling hillsî in July let the rider get more tired. Another way is that of water from severe heat which can lead to dehydration. And finally the path you take along the way and how many stops you make along the way influence the ride. The heat, lack of water, rolling hills, and the advice you get can result badly by affecting the outcome. A rider should make a plan and use determination to get to where they need to go, understanding the environment is key to a successful journey.
1116	7096	3	3	The setting in the story reflects upon the cyclist. In the story a cyclist is riding his bike and takes directions from some old men sitting on a porch. Later he realizes the old men probably had no idea that things change overtime. He says ìNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who havenít left their porches since carter was in office.î(Kurmaskie). The cyclist takes the old-timers ìshortcutî and it takes forever to reach his destination. At the end he reaches his campsite and another person askes him for directions. This time the cyclist says ìYes, sir! I own a very good map,î and ìIíd always stick to it in the future.î The cyclistís message is to follow a map, something you know is right, not a person that might be lying or irresponsible. Ultimately, the cyclist learns a valuable lesson about relying on verifiable information rather than potentially outdated advice.
1117	7097	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated and hot. He was in deserts on a bicycle with his water support running low and the sun beating down mercilessly, and the rough road with plenty of hills made it hard for a bike to overcome. He kept going though the heat was outrageous, radiating off the sand and baking his skin, and dehydration was beginning to overcome him, making each pedal stroke a monumental effort. Despite the challenging environment, the cyclist pressed on, battling the harsh conditions.
1118	7098	3	3	I think the boy should ask you directions for the place where he is going. He can reach the place without water, but that is not a good thing to do; he might get dehydrated and feel unwell along the way. Therefore, seeking proper guidance is the wiser choice.
1119	7099	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclistís mood throughout the essay. Joe @CAPS1 starts with being happy and confident to determined yet helpless and then to relief. Joe writes, ìThings began well enoughÖ flat roadsÖî This quote suggests that in the beginning, everything was okay. He started out with a ìsmile on the face.î (@NUM1) @CAPS2, things start to change @CAPS1 hits changing terrain. He writes, ìÖI noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.î This quote states the changing terrain, contributing to his shift in mood. He starts to lose water to keep him going, yet he pushes himself to the next ìtownî. Finally, when the author reaches ìGary & Wilberís fish campî he is relived when he sees an old guy sitting. The two men say, ìknow The best way to get There? ìYes sir! I own a very good map.î This reveals that Joe didn t ask for more directions which was his first mistake, further highlighting his helplessness. In addition, changes in setting can change a person's mood and attitude, as demonstrated by Joe's journey from initial joy to eventual relief.
1120	7100	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is in the desert and it is in the summer. It affects the cyclist because he is riding a bike. For example, in the story he is running out of water. He is starting to get dehydrated. The harsh desert environment, combined with the physical exertion of cycling, leads to this dangerous situation, emphasizing how the setting directly impacts his well-being.
1121	7101	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the mood and how every change happened. For instance, when the setting changed, the cyclist felt different and it really affected him. Like if the setting was all sunny in a nice town, then he would feel good, perhaps even invigorated and optimistic about the ride ahead. But if he was in a dark town, perhaps one with run-down buildings and a gloomy atmosphere, he wouldn’t feel very happy. He might even feel apprehensive or discouraged. So the setting really affected him, influencing his emotions and potentially even his performance.
1122	7102	3	3	After sometime into his trip he mentioned “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I believe that this setting had gotten him determined to keep on pedaling so he could live. But then he started to think he might die, but he wasnt sad or upset, he was happy. He had sort of chuckled to himself, because of the fact that he might die because he listend to some old men. In my opinion I think he was having the time of his life peddeling through this setting of California, embracing the challenge and finding a strange joy in the face of potential danger, highlighting the profound impact the journey had on him.
1123	7103	3	3	Where cyclist was gave him more disadvantages, then advantages. The advantages were their were hills to go down. Disadvantages hills to go up, water running out when he is in the middle of no where, very hot out, and is lost in the desert, doesnít have much hope until he see's the factory. Biggest disadvantage is he is on a bike, and not in a car. So he has no air conditioning and has to pedel to keep going. But being in the desert on a bike with no water, and you are last, is quite bad. He is very lucky that he made it up the hill or else he wouldíve died out there. And he thought he was seeing things good thing he checked it out. I think for future refrence ride in a car, donít use a bike in the desert, its not to smart, given the circumstances he faced.
1124	7104	3	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist because when all the cyclist is worried about is finding a place with water all he's doing is getting scared and panicking. In other words, when he's looking around, the setting he sees is like desert and no buildings. The story says, ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June"" when he sees that he panics and thinks he's not gonna make it which affects him mentally. This harsh environment, characterized by its aridity and isolation, amplifies his fear and desperation, ultimately impacting his psychological state and hindering his ability to cope effectively."
1125	7105	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in different ways. The woman who had listened to the older men to get where she was going had made her run out of water and almost died of thirst. As she was going to this place, she had seen a snake; ""At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake – it really did look like a diamondback"" (@NUM1). She started to hallucinate, seeing things that weren’t there, further demonstrating the harshness and isolating effects of the environment on her physical and mental state."
1126	7106	3	3	"He was affected by lack of water, the hills, a snake in the way, and the condition of the road. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, explaining how the lack of water was a problem. The hills affected him, as they were ""crippling."" The snake was a long ways on the road, and he didn’t know how to get past it. Finally, the roads were rough, and you shouldn’t go over the speed limit of 55 mph. So, he was affected in a lot of different ways, highlighting the multiple challenges he faced."
1127	7107	3	3	"The features of the barren desert path make the cyclist quite nervous, but they also make him determined to escape them. He passes ìghost towns,î ìabandoned buildings,î and diamondback snakes. These are images traditionally associated with being lost in the deserts, and would be enough to instill fear in most anyone travelling alone. The author even remarks that sadists are probably finding his story pleasing. He often mentions fears of ìdroppingî dead, being eaten by vultures, and, at one point, even wishing death upon himself via choking albeit jokingly. And yet he was determined to live. In spite of the odds stacked against him, he moved on, even after losing ìwhat (he) believed to be (his) lost burst energy."" He even maintains a sense of humor throughout, writing of a diary entry that would be left behind that remarks on the wisdom of old men. In the end, when he finds a place to rest, he turns it all into a lesson heíll surely abide by: follow the map! This journey, though fraught with peril and existential dread, ultimately reinforces his will to survive and learn from his mistakes."
1128	7108	3	3	"The cyclist is affected by the heat, the hills, and the lack of people. For example, the cyclist was growing short on water and had ""wide rings of dried sweat on his shirt,"" and he could ""drop from heatstroke."" The hills must have forced him to use more energy, draining him further. Lastly, the lack of people exacerbated his situation. If the towns still had people, the cyclist wouldn't have been as affected by the setting, as he could have potentially resupplied or sought assistance."
1129	7109	3	3	Features of any setting affect what you do and how you do it. Features affect the cyclist by water, help, and safety. The cyclist's desperate need for water is highlighted when he sucks on a rock to circulate his saliva, attempting to alleviate his thirst. The rough terrain and the outdated, abandoned road, recommended by the old men, leave him isolated, unable to find directions or confirm his route. Encountering a snake along this desolate path underscores the danger; a bite, far from civilization, could prove fatal due to the lack of immediate medical help. Similarly, the risk of heatstroke is magnified by the absence of water and assistance. Safety, help, and water are critical factors, and these environmental features significantly impact the cyclist's journey and well-being.
1130	7110	3	3	The features of the setting make the ride for the cyclist very hard. It has a lot of hills, which would make him use more energy. Also, it is a desert, so it is very hot and dry. This makes the author need more water than he normally would. The author said “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The author knew that it was very dangerous to travel there without water; he said “I could drop from heatstroke.” If the setting had been cooler there would not be so much danger, and the cyclist’s journey would have been significantly easier and safer, underscoring the harsh impact of the desert environment on his ride.
1131	7111	3	3	The cyclist’s features around him affected him negatively. He was cycling through “the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His water bottle was slowly running out and the only town he came to that had water had water that tasted like battery acid. Events seemed pretty bad, until the speaker became elated when they saw a @ORGANIZATION1 factory. The author was thirsty and the side of the building had “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The building was abandoned. The speaker then states “Somehow I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope” (Kurmaskie @NUM3). He lost hope after that landscape, and he pretty much gave up, as the mirage of refreshment only deepened his despair. The landscape or features affected the author very negatively due to the lack of water, ultimately crushing his spirits.
1132	7112	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because there were lots of hills, making the ride physically demanding, and very little water, leading to dehydration and fatigue. These environmental challenges combined to significantly impact the cyclist's performance and well-being, turning what might have been a pleasant ride into an arduous struggle.
1133	7113	3	3	The cyclist in the story “Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, is heavily affected by the features of the setting in the story. First is the “shortcut” that is suggested to get to Moab, which naturally just ends up separating him from all other people and putting him in the middle of nowhere with a limited supply of water. His water shortage is the second thing that affects him because it makes him despair and feel that he is about to collapse and die. In the story, he says: “It really didn’t matter. I was going to die and the lizards would pick me clean.” This shows that the features of the setting made him feel hopeless, highlighting how the harsh environment directly contributed to his feelings of desperation.
1134	7114	3	3	"Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie. One feature that affected the character was the heat of the sun. The narration states ""The sun was beginning to beat down."" This increasing heat likely added to the cyclist's physical exhaustion as he continued his journey, making the ride more challenging."
1135	7115	3	3	"The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in the story ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî. In the story it says, ""I was traveling through the high desert of California in June."" This is telling the reader that the weather was hot and you need a lot of water here to survive, especially if you are riding a bike or working. The relentless sun beating down would make any physical activity extremely challenging. Later on in the story it says, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This quote gives the reader information and tells us that the cyclist is having a hard time surviving through the harsh features of the setting. In California deserts I know from prior knowledge it is hot and dry, especially in the summer. If you are working outside, like the cyclist in this story is, and you do not have water to drink, you will get dehydrated which eventually leads to death. The author does a good job showing the readers how the setting affects the cyclist and highlights the dangers of the environment."
1136	7116	3	3	In the essay ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. One thing is the water situation. There is little water and it is boiling hot from the sun. He cautiously took a small taste of it. He said ìIt tasted like battery acide.î To me if the water is hot donít taste it. Another thing is the land's terrain. The land went from straight and flat to hilly and inclined. That started slowing him down and increased his exertion. Last, is the change in day time. It started turning dark and he was still biking and pushing on. He wanted to get as far as he could before the complete darkness set in. The environment's challenges, from scarce, bad-tasting water to the demanding landscape and encroaching darkness, all put immense pressure on the cyclist.
1137	7117	3	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist when he got tired very easily because he was biking in the desert in June. The scorching sun beat down relentlessly, draining his energy. There are no rivers in that desert so he couldn't get water. His throat was parched, and each pedal stroke felt heavier than the last. It is so hot out there that he couldn't see very well because of all the sweat that went into his eyes, blurring the already hazy horizon. Also, there are no people out there because of how hot it is, so he knew he was completely alone in his struggle against the harsh environment, making his situation even more dire.
1138	7118	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit î the setting affected the cyclist. The setting affected the cyclist mentally and physically; when the sun was shining and the road smooth, he had a positive outlook and was full of energy. Later in the essay, as the weather turned and the terrain became more treacherous, the cyclist grew weary and distressed, his initial optimism fading with each difficult mile. The external environment directly mirrored and influenced his internal state, demonstrating the powerful connection between surroundings and well-being, ultimately impacting his journey.
1139	7119	3	3	A cyclist always has to face many problems such as the weather, like strong winds or heavy rain, and the condition of the road, including potholes or uneven surfaces.
1140	7120	3	3	"The features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. The first way the features in the setting affected the cyclist is that the whole trail was deserted, leaving him alone with no water. In the story it says, ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time – say, before the last world war – but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town,"" which explains that he was alone and that the first town he visited was deserted, contributing to his growing thirst and isolation. These inhospitable conditions of the setting clearly had a detrimental impact on the cyclist's well-being and journey."
1141	7121	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist, as the lack of water made him tired and a bit delusional. The lack of shade increased the rate of dehydration. The rough road made it hard to balance. And the snack slowed him down. He thought that he was going to die, fearing the harsh environment would ultimately defeat him.
1142	7122	3	3	"The setting of the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" is very important to the events that occured in the story. For example the story was set on a highway set at @NUM1 which the cyclist was only able to do @NUM2. This is signifigant to the events of the story because since he was doing @NUM2, which by the away is a lot for a cyclist and it led to almost dehydration. Plus it was hilly, adding to the physical strain. This led to the excution of the cyclist, so one could see that setting is very important to the outcome of the story."
1143	7123	3	3	The setting is in a California which isnít really the coolest of places to be, temperature-wise, especially during the scorching summer months.
1144	7124	3	3	"At the beginning of his journey, the cyclist is relaxed and enjoys the features of his environment. He says, ìI enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening.î At a campground in @LOCATION1, the setting is calming and relaxing. At the first town, the setting is shocking, but humorous to the cyclist and he starts to get nervous. After looking around he says, ìthis sight was trowolingî. The cyclist's trip gets worse when he reads about the next town: ìflat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This part of his journey affects him the most, leaving him physically drained. His environment and the features of the land have made him tired and thirsty. The setting has a major role for a cyclist, influencing not only his physical state but also his overall experience."
1145	7125	3	3	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead; Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting is integral to how the cyclist feels and behaves. The cyclist feels a growing desperation as the setting around him gets progressively more bleak. In the beginning of the trip, the cyclist encounters a ghost town. ""I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" The cyclist is still thinking positively at this point in the essay, demonstrating a resilience fueled by the initial novelty of the journey. A while later, the cyclist comes across another abandoned set of buildings. He feels that this sight is ""troubling."" The cyclist is worried, he is not yet depressive and pessimistic, but the increasing desolation is clearly starting to wear on his spirits. Farther down the road, the terrain of the road changes, and he sees the sign that gives the essay its name."" The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting 8. Sometimes life’s can feel so cruel."" The cyclist’s surroundings get progressively worse as he rides on, but eventually he finds a place with working water. He is so overjoyed by this building that he wants to find the owners, and kiss them. This profound shift in emotion, from despair to elation, underscores how deeply the environment shapes his internal state, proving the setting's crucial role in dictating the cyclist's feelings and actions throughout his arduous journey."
1146	7126	3	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist is he is riding a bike through the dessert. He says “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” So he was scorching hot peddling a bike. The road became bumpy and rutty. A sign had said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted Speed limit.” The speed limit was @NUM1 and he was going @NUM2 so it must have been hard to get over all the bumps. The lastly he comes across a poisonous snake that blocked the majority of the pavement in front of him. So him dehydrated trying to get around a snake would be terrifying. So on his journey the setting doesn’t help him much.
1147	7127	3	3	The cyclist ran into many issues in his/her travel to @LOCATION1. They had to dismiss many hardships such as lack of water, being lost, immense desert heat, plus minor things like snakes and road conditions. The setting of the California desert in June was the most intense hardship, compounded by the crucial lack of water. Though the heat started preying at the cyclist’s brain by making them see mirages, etc. The heat and entire setting made the cyclist’s travel much harder, ultimately testing their endurance and resolve.
1148	7128	3	3	The setting affect the cyclist because in the hot heat of California in June which nobody wants to be outside. But first, was the heat which took a lot out of his body while trying to keep it cool. Then came the factor of which he had very little water when he reached the first town and in the story it said, ìA tar like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.î So now he has no cool water to drink when he says, ìNot two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î So the cyclist has very little water is not having to endoor the hardest part of the ride, making the physical challenge even more daunting. Then later on he makes a mention to change a paragraph if he loss consciousness. Also he talked about him might getting a heatstroke. Hinting to the fact that the setting he was in was affecting him in many different ways, pushing him to his physical and mental limits.
1149	7129	3	3	"The setting of the essay ìDo not exceed posted speed limit,"" is very dry, sandy, hot, and deserted. On his way to Yosemite he takes a ìshort cut"" so he goes through the desert. When he first leaves its in a hot and flat part of the desert. His mood is high and he has confidence. ìThings began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile of my face.î With this he arrives at the first ìtownî but he isnít worried he has plenty of water he moves on. The terrain starts working against him in his search for water, ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills a large high way sign jumped out at him. It read: Rough Road Ahead : Do not Exceed posted speed limit.î This lowers his confidence, especially because everything is deserted and if he has a heat stroke no one would be around to find him. He keeps up his determination when he sees the factory yet he moves on. When he sees the first camp he is overwhelmed with relief and the terrain flattens out again. When asked if he needs direction he says he has his own map so he can stick to the terrain he knows is best. He can keep his hopes for himself and follow a true set of directions, maintaining control over his journey despite the harsh environment."
1150	7130	3	3	Anyone who has ever rode a bike knows how relaxing it can truly be, but when you are forced to ride miles and miles on unforgiving terrain without any water, relaxation feels like an oasis, especially going through beat-up roads with dryness all around you really puts a damper on your experience, as it extends your need for thirst by enhancing the amount of dryness in the air and the amount of energy you are having. The ability to block all of that out and trying to focus on something easier to handle is exactly what you want to do in these situations, that unforgiving terrain can really build character into a cyclist, but adding the fact the amount of water he had was none, and the dryness around him, it sounds like torture. I can only hope that if I ever become a cyclist, I never have to endure this kind of situation.
1151	7131	3	3	The cyclist, Joe Kurmaskie, had a rough time traveling to Yosemite National Park. Granted he was misled, but if the conditions of the terrain and if the climate were working for him it would've made life a whole lot easier. Not only was it hot, being in a desert in California in June, but he only had one water bottle. One water bottle wouldn’t have lasted a little longer if it was a straight shot through, but it wasn’t. The roads went up, down, there were hills, there were towns-ghost towns at that. The only water he could pump from the pump was scalding hot and tasted acidic. Also, he wouldn’t have lost as much energy if it was a straight shot. It’s easy to say that he literally roughed it, having to resort to putting rocks in his mouth to circulate saliva. All in all, he was very determined to work through the very unfortunate conditions he had working against him, and very lucky to survive it.
1152	7132	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the fact that he is pedaling a bike through the high deserts of California in June makes the intensity level of the story very high. The scorching sun beating down and the dry air make each pedal stroke a monumental effort. If it would have been springtime and there was a nice breeze, it would be different; the ride would be more pleasant, and the physical challenge diminished significantly, altering the narrative's tone. Therefore, the harshness of the environment directly shapes the cyclist's experience and the overall story's tension.
1153	7133	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by lack of water, a poisonous snake, and the condition of the road. For example, the lack of water affected the cyclist because he couldn't make it without water; he could have passed out if he didn't have water, especially under the hot sun. Another example of how the setting affected the cyclist would be the poisonous snake; if he had gotten bitten, he could have died because there would be nobody to help him in the remote location, and antivenom might not be readily available. And the last example of how the setting affected him would be the condition of the road because it made it tougher for the cyclist to get to his destination with hills and windy rounds, slowing his progress and increasing his exertion. This is how I think the setting affected the cyclist and presented significant challenges to his journey.
1154	7134	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that if it's hot and you're riding a long way you need a lot of water so you don't get dehydrated, potentially impacting performance. Also, it can affect your vision because you're looking at the sun, possibly causing glare and impacting visibility. Another way cyclists can get affected by the setting is because what if the road is all bumpy and just not in good shape; it can affect the way they ride their bike, leading to discomfort or even accidents. The environment clearly plays a crucial role in a cyclist's experience and safety.
1155	7135	3	3	"The story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by @PERSON1 had some statements that were kind of pointless to put in. One sentence in the essay had a couple of words that don’t need to be used. In the sentence, ""about forty miles into the pedal, I arrive at the first 'town,'"" I don’t think ""into the pedal"" needs to be in there because it’s not describing anything relevant to the arrival at the town. Removing it would make the sentence more concise and direct, focusing on the distance and the destination."
1156	7136	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is, the setting. The cyclist is out in the dessert, in two-hundred degree weather, with very little water. Also, the cyclist didn`t have a map and he asked someone that hasn`t left their porch since Carter was in office. ''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn`t been off their porch in decades.'' This quote talks about how the setting can affect him. The extreme heat and lack of resources, exacerbated by poor directions, created a dangerous situation. Also, he listened to someone that didn't know what they were talking about. In conclusion that is how the features of setting affected the cyclist.
1157	7137	3	3	The story unfolds in a harsh, desert-like setting, a sweltering expanse where the protagonist pushes his physical limits to survive. The road is unforgiving, a gauntlet of rough terrain and sharp turns that demand constant vigilance. At one point, a surge of adrenaline fuels him; he pedals with fierce determination down a steep hill, then savors a moment of respite. This desert environment with its challenging road conditions forms the backdrop for his struggle, highlighting both his resilience and the brief moments of relief he finds.
1158	7138	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because the condition of his surroundings was hot, so he got dehydrated more quickly and needed more water to compensate. There were a lot of hills, meaning he had to pedal harder and use more energy to get up the inclines, testing his endurance. Because there were no cars, buildings, or smog, just nature surrounding him, it was a peaceful and relaxing ride on the bike; that's how the setting affects the cyclist, both physically and mentally, creating a challenging yet serene experience.
1159	7139	3	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in a great way. His journey would not be as difficult if these factors had not crossed his path. Climate, location, and population all have an effect on the cyclist. In the story, it is told that the cyclist is in the dry climate in California, in the heat of June. There is also a lack of water, so he must pace his sips carefully. Therefore, there are also few towns, making it hard to get good advice and supplies. The cyclist also comes across a snake, making him affected by native wild life. The dry climate and lack of water affect him by causing doubt. The cyclist is constantly worried about passing out and dying of dehydration. The cyclist also gets doubts when he sees the road signs reminding him how slow he is going. The snake also has a depressing effect about his dangers on his journey. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist and his mental resolve. His journey does teach you though, that through determination you will be rewarded. You have to want things bad enough and put the effort into it. The author also teaches you to always have a positive attitude to get success, showcasing how internal strength can overcome external challenges.
1160	7140	3	3	The features and settings affected the cyclist because of all the dangers of doing it, like sunstroke and dehydration. He took advice from old people to do it, hoping their experience would guide him. But even though it started out good with clear skies and a manageable pace, almost nothing last forever. He's riding a bike in the middle of summer with little water and in the desert, the heat radiating intensely. He runs into towns that are abandon and the next town is only @NUM1 miles are litheraly going to be rough roads ahead, filled with rocks and sand. But when he did get to the town that was abandon to, despair threatened to consume him, until he found hope and seeing a man in a chair, a sign of possible help. The cyclist's journey is a testament to the fleeting nature of initial advantages, and the challenges that arise when venturing into harsh and unforgiving environments, yet hope persists.
1161	7141	3	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not being in town. I say this because the cyclist talks about ""old timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office."" This suggests isolation and a rural environment, so that means he doesn't know where he's at, emphasizing his unfamiliarity with this particular, out-of-the-way place."
1162	7142	3	3	In the cyclist's journey to Yosemite, several factors hinder him from reaching it. The first is obviously the false information given to him by the elders regarding the correct path. The second is that because the information wasn't true, the cyclist had an insufficient amount of water for the actual, longer journey. This made him dehydrated and weakened. The last is the fact that the route given to him included obstacles such as snakes slithering across the path, dangerously rocky roads that threatened his tires, and unsettling old ghost towns and abandoned buildings which made the cyclist less confident and more fearful. Those are the features of the setting which significantly affected the cyclist's progress and overall well-being, ultimately contributing to his struggle.
1163	7143	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because he should have stuck to his own map, considering the terrain. He should have also packed an extra bottle of water, given the potential for heat and exertion. He should not take any advice from people that haven't left the porch in years, as their knowledge of current conditions is likely outdated. Therefore, adapting to the setting requires preparation and reliable information.
1164	7144	3	3	"The setting affects the cyclist's mood in the story. The cyclist takes a shortcut with many abandoned towns and buildings, as well as a bumpy terrain. When he came to a fork in his path that had a water pump, he immediately began to pump it; the water was not good for drinking. He was determined to make it to the next town. ""I could make that,"" he said. Because of the ghost town and the old pump, he had to continue on. When the cyclist came to a sign in the road warning him about the road ahead, he began to get depressed, ""I was sad."" Finally, when he reached Miller's and Johnson's Fish Camp, he was thankful and wanted to show his gratitude. The setting can affect a cyclist by his mood; at first, the cyclist is determined, but as the setting gets worse, his mood and hopes go down the drain. At the end, when the setting is bright, so is his mood, demonstrating how powerfully environment influences emotional state."
1165	7145	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was thirsty and it was hot, the sun beating down relentlessly, and he was almost out of water. He almost died because when he was drinking the last of his water, desperately gulping it down, he hit a bump and spit got lodged in his throat, causing him to choke. Adding to his misery were the tiring hills; it seemed to never end, each incline sapping more of his dwindling strength. Thus, the harsh environment pushed the cyclist to his physical limit.
1166	7146	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he wasn't prepared in the beginning; the cyclist got directions from an old man who hadn't left his porch in years, so he wouldn't know what had changed. Then the cyclist starts his journey with not a lot of water. When he got to the second town, ""I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills."" This quote means that he wasn't expecting hills; he thought it was going to be a flat way. Also in the @NUM1 degree weather with a limited water supply, he couldn't ride up and down hills easily, making the journey more difficult. Going down the hills gave him a break, a brief respite from the arduous climb. That's how the cyclist was affected by the setting's features, highlighting the impact of the unexpected terrain and harsh conditions on his unprepared journey."
1167	7147	3	3	"A lot of factors affected the cyclist. Temperature, terrain, and directions all gave the cyclist doubt. The temperature through the high deserts of California left the cyclist feeling hot, parched, and irritable. Through the story, he had all but a few sips of water left. Knowing you're running low on water ""to feel sorry for himself."" The cyclist had biked so far the terrain started to change from flat to ""rolling hills."" This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levels before. Lastly, the feeling of hope could have affected him the most. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome. Having just leisurely taken instructions by an old man cost the cyclist hours of torture. The author did a great job using hyperbole to exaggerate the cyclist's feeling of lost hope. He also used very detailed text to paint the reader a picture. These literary elements made it easier for me to understand the effect the temperature, terrain, and hope had on the cyclist, showcasing the author's skill in conveying the cyclist's internal struggles."
1168	7148	3	3	The features of the setting really affect the cyclist. He is led into false pretenses by the immediate surroundings. Little does he know that it would bring him into danger? When he comes to a rock in the road and finds that the water pumps are not good he is in serious danger. In the reading it says ìThe sun was beginning to heat down, but it hardly noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.î The setting let the cyclists mind wonder so much that he didnít even realize the heat. This shows how the beautiful environment masked the potential threats, ultimately contributing to the perilous situation he encountered later on the trail, highlighting the deceptive nature of his surroundings.
1169	7149	3	3	In the short story, ìDo Not Exceed Posted speed limit,î by Joe Kurmaskie, expresses the features of the setting like the lack of water, and can not find help to the end affects the cyclist in the story. The barren landscape and absence of assistance amplify his desperation. During his time of need the cyclist says, ìIt didnít really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise old men their wisdom.î The cyclist has a lack of necessities in the features around him and is letting his pride fall down; giving up on hope. This quote showcases his acceptance of fate, highlighting the psychological impact of the harsh environment. When the cyclist finds hope, ìAnd drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.î The cyclist was astonished of what he had stumbled onto and appreciated that he was still alive. The cyclist should not have taken the old peoples advice for granted, but will now look onto peopleís sense of directions, showing a newfound respect for the wisdom he initially dismissed, demonstrating how near-death experiences can alter one's perspective.
1170	7150	3	3	Setting affects many things in stories. The setting in this story affected the cyclist. The setting was very hot and it slowed him down a lot. For example he said he was doing 55 miles an hour, but with the heat, he could only manage 40. The extreme weather clearly had a negative impact on his speed and performance. The story highlights how much the environment can impact a character's capabilities.
1171	7151	3	3	The setting in the story was the high deserts of California in June. At first, the cyclist had seemed really confident and excited about his journey. It was during it that he had changed his mind. The cyclist was running low on his water supplies, so he stops and pumps water from this water pump, but all he gets is this acid taste. So he is on his way to the nearest town which is @NUM1 miles away, and he thinks he can make it. So he is heading towards the nearest town when the terrain starts changing. It changes from flat road to short rolling hills. During this time, the cyclist starts losing hope. He thinks that he is going to die of dehydration and the birds are going to pick him apart. Then, when he thought he couldn’t make it, he saw a sign that said ìGary and @CAPS1 fish camp.î He ran into the shop and took long drinks from the sink in the bathroom, and when he went out of the store an older gentleman asked him if he needed help, and he said no, I have a really good map. The hot temperature and rolling hills have a negative effect on the cyclist; he goes from being confident to thinking he is seeing mirages and dying. It states in the story ìI wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnít a mirageî and ìI was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.î So this brought self-doubting behavior, as the harsh environment and physical challenges eroded his initial optimism and replaced it with fear and desperation.
1172	7152	3	3	The features of the setting where the cyclist are affect them very drastically. They need a water supply, and if they don’t have one, they might dehydrate or even die from heatstroke. They need shade trees because it keeps the sun from beaming down on them so hard, reducing the risk of sunburn and heat exhaustion. They also need to cycle when it's not as hot outside, like early morning or late evening, so that just in case their water gets low, there is a better chance of survival. It would be great if there was someone with you to help if you get hurt in a fall or have a mechanical issue with your bike. There should be buildings nearby just in case of an emergency requiring assistance or shelter. It might even be good to carry a cell phone to call for help if needed. These environmental and logistical considerations are crucial for cyclist safety and well-being.
1173	7153	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more than one way. The first features were a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnít hold in the lamest mule. These items gave the cyclist a feeling of doubt. They made him begin to think he had taken the wrong route when he saw these things were outdated. Then, he couldnít get any cold, clean water out of the pumps to save his life. This lack of refreshment was the first obstacle which affected him. The next features of the setting which caused a problem were the tumbleweeds and ""a ridiculously large snake."" They made the cyclist scared and caused him to go around these things, wasting energy. You can tell he was scared because he quoted ""I eased past."" When the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, the cyclistís journey became exhausting, never ending, and difficult, further draining his strength. Two more things affected the cyclist. These two things consist of the signs. One of which read ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" and the other ""GARY AND WILBER'S FISH-IF you want bait for the big ones, weíre your BEST BET."" The first sign affected him in a negative way and caused him to become a little angry and frustrated because he was tired and dehydrated, and the rough road ahead gave him no hope. The second sign led him to water, which was the one thing that would make things better, so it had a positive affect, providing much-needed relief. Therefore, the cyclist's experience was significantly shaped by the environment, both negatively and positively, throughout his journey."
1174	7154	3	3	"The setting affected the cyclist: due to the changes in terrain. A rough spot for the cyclist was when the terrain changed from a flat stretch to rolling hills. The author wrote, ìI tolld on""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was pushing through the rough and it was not an easy stretch to get through. Another place in the cyclist's trip that was difficult was when he saw the abandoned juice factory. The narration states, ìover one long, crippling hill, a building came into view""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The context clues that provide information that it wasn't easy are the words ""long"" and ""crippling."" The impact of those words provide feelings of being drug on through the rough setting of the cyclist's trip. These specific word choices effectively highlight the challenging environment and the cyclist's struggle to overcome it, emphasizing the difficulties presented by the terrain."
1175	7155	3	3	The cyclist had experienced some hard obstacles on his ride to Yosemite. He had gotten directions from a group of old men who hadenít gone the places they told him about in a long time. Where they said there would be a town it was more like a ghost town. The day that the cyclist was riding was very hot and he was riding through the desert, which made it worse. Because of the heat he was drinking his water regularly to stay hydrated. This meant he was running out of it fast, and since the old men had given him directions through places that were no longer open, he couldnít get more water. The cyclist also had to go over roads that were in bad condition, which slowed him down even more. All of those environmental features at the setting affected the cyclist a lot on his trip.
1176	7156	3	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. In the beginning, he cannot get water and becomes dehydrated, which saps his strength as he pedals under the relentless sun. Then, he goes on a rough ride and loses more energy as the jarring terrain forces him to work harder to maintain his balance and speed. Then he finds the bait and gratefully drinks the water, replenishing his depleted reserves. All of these greatly affect the cyclist's condition, demonstrating the significant impact the environment has on his physical state and ability to continue.
1177	7157	3	3	The setting of the cyclist’s journey affected him because he was in a hot desert in California. This affected him because he had to ride a bike through it, and the heat took a lot out of him, making each mile a struggle. He didn’t have a lot of water because there were no rivers or water supply due to the desert surrounding him, adding dehydration to his difficulties. At the end, he finds a store, which affects him greatly because he gets a cool drink and some supplies, which helped him recover his strength. So, in the end, his surroundings both destroyed him and then relieved him, demonstrating the desert's power to both harm and, unexpectedly, provide.
1178	7158	3	3	The bicyclist was riding to Yosemite National Park and on the way ran out of water. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Then, hills came into play which makes you more tired and thirsty. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. The rider didn’t think he would live; he felt the sun beating down, and his throat was parched. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean,” he thought, imagining the vultures circling. But finally, he spotted a small ranger station, a beacon of hope in the arid landscape. He rushed inside and drank deeply from the sink, gulping down the cool liquid. Refreshed and revitalized, he continued his ride, the fear of dehydration now replaced with a renewed sense of determination, and he finished his ride.
1179	7159	3	3	In the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affected the cyclist a lot. At first, when the cyclist set off in the morning, the conditions were great. It was breezy with shade from trees and rivers. Then, after a few hours, the cyclist was in the desert with bumpy hills. In the story, the speaker states, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The condition of the roads and not having water really affected the cyclist. It took more energy to get up and down the hills without any shade, which meant that he needed more water, which he didn’t have any. This change in the landscape, from flat, shaded paths to a hilly, exposed desert, significantly drained his energy and resources. The demanding terrain, coupled with the lack of readily available water, exacerbated his dehydration. The condition of the setting really affected the cyclist, and if it was easier to bike, they might have not been so dehydrated, highlighting how crucial environmental factors were to the cyclist's physical state and overall experience.
1180	7160	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by disturbing them to ride on the road, limiting their speed, and making their distance longer than the original travel plan. For example, the features at the setting disturb the cyclist’s road travel because signs dictate permissible routes, such as ""no entering"" or ""one way"" signs. Second, speed is limited because posted speed limits, such as @NUM1, restrict cyclists, increasing travel time. Third, distance increases, impacting travel plans and speed. A ""Rough road ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit"" sign exemplifies this. Therefore, setting features significantly affect cyclists during their journey."
1181	7161	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they doubt or lessen his chances for survival, but the cyclist is determined so he survives. The harsh, unforgiving terrain, with its steep inclines and treacherous descents, constantly threatens to throw him off balance. The scorching sun relentlessly beats down, dehydrating him and sapping his strength. Yet, despite these formidable obstacles that diminish his prospects, the cyclist presses on, fueled by an unwavering resolve to overcome the challenges and reach his destination, ultimately proving that determination can triumph over adversity.
1182	7162	3	3	"In the essay, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature that affects him is his lack of water: ""The water bottles contained only a few tantallizing sips."" The lack of water made him very desperate, especially when he came to the Welch's grape juice factory. The building—abandoned years earlier—had been a Welch's grape juice factory and bottling plant. This desperation, after he had come to the abandoned factory, was followed by disappointment and a vague sense of hopelessness expressed by the phrase, ""I hung my head"" after he had found the abandoned factory. This broken promise of potential refreshment, offered by the sight of the factory yet ultimately unattainable, further emphasizes how the setting actively contributes to the cyclist's emotional and physical state. These are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist."
1183	7163	3	3	No water, rough terrain, bad info—all are reasons why the boy isn't doing so well. I said no water because he is dehydrated but needs to conserve his water. Also, he could die from heat exhaustion, a serious risk in this environment. I also said rough terrain because he could fall and get hurt, with no one around to help him if he twists an ankle or worse. And to top it off, he took info from old people that didn’t know what they were talking about, leading him astray with outdated or inaccurate advice. These all contribute to his predicament.
1184	7164	3	3	In the story by Joe Kurmaskie it tells about a cyclists challenge through the heated deserts of California in June. The cyclist had started out with confidence, followed by determination, then relief. The setting affected the cyclist physically and mentally. First, listening to the old men was stupid, then taking the trip not certain if you would have enough water, and lastly traveling through the desert in June. He started getting a little doubtful with himself as well, that won’t help much with bringing success of the trip. Once he had made it to a fish camp an old man even older then the men who gave him the false information told him he knew how to get to Yosemite, but the young man did the best thing and told him he already knew how to get there, resisting more bad advice. He didn’t need to be traveling out in the desert heat for hours that’s just unhealthy, and by trusting his own instincts, the cyclist ensured his safe passage and the ultimate completion of his challenging journey.
1185	7165	3	3	A cyclist is affected by many things when riding, most being features of the setting. One feature of the setting that can have an affect is the terrain. If the terrain is rough then the cyclist could have a more difficult time maintaining control of the bike, especially if he is not a professional rider. For example, the author of the essay on page @NUM1 titled: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, had a hard times on the rougher roads partly due to his level of experience. Another aspect of the environment that can have an affect on a cyclist is the climate. Most people who go cycling and know anything about the sport know how to dress for it to keep their body at a comfortable temperature but sometimes the weather plays tricks on us. The cyclist could get caught in a sudden heat wave or a sudden drop in temperature, ultimately affecting the cyclist's overall performance and safety.
1186	7166	3	3	The features of the setting enhance the cyclist’s desperate spirit. Throughout the whole journey the cyclist is by himself and there are no people, cars, or buildings around. This isolation intensified his desperation, as a fall or dehydration would leave him helpless and alone. Also, he came upon things such as “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant” which initially raised his hopes for respite, but would soon crush his spirits upon realizing they offered no aid. These events fueled his growing desperation because he had no external support and nothing to fall back on in a life or death situation, ultimately underscoring the harsh reality of his solitary struggle.
1187	7167	3	3	"In the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First of all as he was riding about @NUM1 miles up the road, he saw that the terrain was changing and that scared him; he says ìThis sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly ì(kurmaskie @NUM2). He is saying that as the things around him began to change, the more his anxiety rose. And he kept drinking a lot of water just to try and calm his nerves. Another example is after he had left the sign that told him not to pass. He says ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (kurmaskie @NUM3). This is also an example of fear that started over coming him, when he saw even more changes in the landscape. He wasnít going to stop because of the road changes and the fact that his water was almost gone; he still had the courage to go further. The setting brought him fear, yet despite this mounting apprehension, he persevered and made it through."
1188	7168	3	3	The cyclist had run out of water. He had mentioned it tasted like battery acid, a final, bitter dreg. The surroundings affected him, looking around and not seeing anybody for miles. That brings despair. Also, a desert with the hot sun beating down on him, with just sand and cactus all around added to his feeling of hopelessness. Now, if you saw that, you would think of no water or shade because the desert is put to image when you hear those descriptions, amplifying the sense of isolation and desperate need. The combination of the harsh environment and lack of resources would naturally lead to feelings of despair and a heightened awareness of his precarious situation.
1189	7169	3	3	"The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. In the story, the arid landscape offers no water for the cyclist, contributing to his physical weakness. Mentally, he is greatly affected by the harsh environment. For instance, seeing the abandoned Welch's factory and the image of a boy ""pour a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth"" deeply impacts him. This vision of refreshment only serves to intensify his thirst, causing him to hang his head as he rode on. Overwhelmed by the desolate surroundings, he even contemplates the possibility of dying there. This interplay between the setting's features and the cyclist's internal state illustrates how profoundly the environment shapes his experience."
1190	7170	3	3	"I believe the first photograph closely relates to the story ""As Worry"" because the author's son suffers a lot. It shows what he and his friends look like @MONTH1. Also it shows the surf boards, emphasizing that they are surfers. That is what I believe about the first picture. The second only relates a little because it has a surfer surfing. So, in conclusion, the first photograph is more accurate to the story than the second photo."
1191	7171	3	3	When the bicyclist was trying to find Yosemite he stumbled into a million settings. One in the beginning was when he was talking to the old men on the porch, and they sent him off into the distance of nothing but desert. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted him. It was desolate and only him. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed his path, a sure sign he was off course, and a ridiculously large snake – it really did look like a diamondback – blocked the majority of the pavement in front of him. Tumbleweeds usually mean desert. He also saw the @CAPS1 grape juice factory and the bait store where he finally found someone else to give him directions, showing the unexpected turns in his journey. The variety of these disparate locations highlights the bicyclist's misadventures while trying to reach his destination.
1192	7172	3	3	In the story rough road ahead the cyclist is affected by the setting in many ways. Because he was in a desert in June it was very hot, so he got thirsty and had to ration his water carefully. Also because of the heat he could have dehydration or heat stroke, making the ride even more dangerous. Lastly because it was a desert the wild animals like the snakes and lizards could hurt or poison him, and he could die; this constant threat added to the cyclist's challenges, showing how the setting of the story affected the cyclist.
1193	7173	3	3	The cyclist in ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by @PERSON1 suffers from hardship while riding through the desert. The features of the setting affected the cyclist by having no water to drink because it was a desert; there was no vegetation, meaning no water, so he was becoming dehydrated. Also, the setting of the towns he went to had no living organisms or people, so he couldnít quench his thirst there. In one town there was a spigot, but the water was gross and hadnít been pumped in a while, making it undrinkable. Then he comes to the Welchís juice factory, which was abandoned, and from there he thought he was done for, but then he finally came to a shop where there are bathrooms where he drinks water from the sink and he is relieved. Also, the rocky roads affected him because he barely had any water left, and rocky terrain tends to take more strength and endurance, further depleting his limited resources. Ultimately, the harsh desert environment and its lack of resources pushed the cyclist to his physical and mental limits, highlighting the critical role of the setting in shaping his arduous journey.
1194	7174	3	3	"In the passage DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the desert’s features did not have any positive affects on the cyclist. The desert contained ""rolling hills."" When a cyclist goes over hills it takes more energy due to the laws of gravity. Because the cyclist used more energy to go over the hills, he only had enough energy to ""feel sorry"" for himself. The more hills, the more energy lost, the more tired he became. The desert was also hot, and dry. Obviously, since he was in the ""deserts of California in June,"" the weather would make him become thirsty. He did stop for water, but a ""tarlike substance"" came out instead, further adding to his discomfort. When he again stopped later for water, it was ""cool"" and most likely refreshing, providing much-needed relief. Riding his bike in the hilly, dry, hot desert, the cyclist understandably became tired and thirsty, demonstrating how the desert environment negatively impacted his journey."
1195	7175	3	3	The features of the settings effect the cyclist by obstacles in the settings. A obstacle is a object in the way of you and were your trying to go. Some obstacles in the story such as hills, forks in the road, and also rough road. In the story “Road Ahead Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the rider runs into a large highway sign jumped out at me it read: Rough road, presenting a challenge to navigate and potentially causing discomfort or damage to the bicycle. These environmental factors all influence the cyclist's journey.
1196	7176	3	3	In the story, ìDo not exceed posted speed limitî, the setting affects the way that the cyclist rides. In this story, the setting is out in nowhere with no water, and all he can see is roads. This affects the cyclist because he is hungry, thirsty, and now he's about to go down a really steep hill with fear of crashing and seriously insuring himself with noone around to get help. The desolate setting of nowhere significantly amplifies his anxieties and influences his cautious approach to the descent. The environment's harshness and isolation directly contribute to his heightened sense of vulnerability and the need for extreme care while navigating the dangerous hill, which is a reminder that the setting is a major player in influencing his actions.
1197	7177	3	3	The features in the story tell me that it was in a very dry, not populated area. It says that there were rolling hills, in a desert of California, and that it was dry. I think those things affected the cyclist by dehydrating him. Going up and down hills can be very tiring, especially when you don’t have a lot of water left, and need to save some. The quote “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” tells me a lot about the story. The cyclist's frequent water consumption indicates the severity of the heat. In a desert in California in June during the summer is a very brave and stupid thing to do. It’s twice as hot during the summer, which can make conditions extremely dangerous. Therefore, the setting plays a crucial role in creating the challenges faced by the cyclist.
1198	7178	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not having good directions from old timers. In the text it says, ''Never accept travel advice, from a collection of old timers who havenít left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office,î this means that the cyclist did not have good directions. Because the road might of changed and the old timers do not know because they been sitting on there porches all the time, meaning their information is outdated. This is why I think the setting affects the cyclist.
1199	7179	3	3	Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.î It talks about a gentlemen who is riding a bike to ìYosemiteî and he does not know exactly how to get there. So he stops and ask some old folks and he says ìNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who havenít left the confines of their porchers since Carter was in office.î They are not familiar with the changes. After he leaves the old-folks he continues on his long, hot journey, pedaling onward with the advice he perhaps should have questioned. He begins to run out of water and so he begins to panic, realizing the severity of his situation in the desolate landscape. Next he comes to the sign that said ìRough.
1200	7180	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is so hot the cyclist keeps drinking and sweating water, so he is really worn down from dehydration and fatigue. Also, just the feeling of how unsafe it is out there is unsettling. Like how he saw a ridiculously large snake, or how it just kept getting hotter as the sun relentlessly beat down, all contributed to his mental and physical exhaustion.
1201	7181	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î the features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist. The setting and the features affected him not only physically, but mentally as well. The setting caused him to doubt himself and the men and also it kept him from having the energy needed to get to where he was going. Where the cyclist was riding, in California, affected him physically. It was hot, and he had no water. This caused him to become tired and frustrated, sapping his physical strength. The setting affected him emotionally as well. He started off fine, but as he went on, and as the road slowly changed to hills, he began to get frustrated and angered that he listened to the men. As he saw no buildings in sight for many miles, he began to lose his determination as well as hope. Lastly, when he saw the sign ìGary and @CAPS1 Fish Campî he started to regain hope and become less frustrated. The setting and features of the essay affected the cyclist not only physically, but mentally as well. He started off determined, then as the setting changed he became doubtful and frustrated. In the end, he turned out satisfied as the setting seemed more hopeful, demonstrating the powerful influence of environment on both body and mind.
1202	7182	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The text first mentions that, ìthere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.î This shows that the cyclist felt insecure and the isolation was starting to upset him. Another example from the text that describes the cyclist is, ìOne ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnít hold in the lamest mule greeted me.î You can see through the cyclist's description that he was frustrated with the dilapidated state of everything, including the useless water from the pumps. This also could have sparked fear in the cyclist because he was running out of water. He was terrified that since the water tasted like, ìbattery acid,î that he wouldnít last much longer in the harsh landscape. In conclusion, the features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist's mental and physical state.
1203	7183	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey. The rusty water pump, highway sign and abandoned juice factory all seemed to make his trip more difficult than it already was. First of all, when the author stumbles along a ìramshackle shedî surrounded by ìseveral rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnít hold in the lames muleî, he is anxious to check the pump for well-needed water. When he finds that he is out of luck and cannot drink the bitter tasting water, his hope droops a little. It is as if the sun were taunting him, telling him that he canít make it. Secondly, he passes a large road sign reading ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî. Once again he begins to feel hopeless, but then turns his angst into determination to finish his journey. He says ìsometimes life can be so cruelî as he notices the speed limit to be 25, but he continues on, pedaling hard. Lastly, the author sees a lone building in the distance and almost doesnít believe his eyes. It turns out to be not only his last hope for water, but an abandoned grape juice factory. He reflects on the irony of his position by saying that his situation ìshould please all sadistsî reading about it. Therefore, the features of the setting affected the reader by highlighting the negativity of his situation, which in turn drives him to continue pedaling.
1204	7184	3	3	In the essay ìDo Not Exceed Speed Limit,î the features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. One way it affected him was that the temperature was very hot, and by it being hot outside his water wouldnít stay cool. This is a problem because you need nice, cool, refreshing water to stay hydrated, especially during strenuous physical activity like cycling. Another way was when he hit a fork in the road; he didnít know which way to go. All he saw was one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnít hold the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling, leaving him uncertain and adding to his physical discomfort. Last but not least, this water pump wasnít working very well, so he got down on his hands and knees and started pumping. The water wouldnít cool down. He tried a drop or two, and the water tasted like battery acid, making it undrinkable and further jeopardizing his hydration. Those are some features of the setting that affected the cyclist on his journey, highlighting how the environment presented challenges to his physical well-being and navigation.
1205	7185	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways. First the rolling hills make it hard to pedal over the land. ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" shows that the terrain was changing into a more difficult course. The cyclist's muscles surely burned with each upward push. ""One long crippling hill,"" also shows how the hills had an effect on the cyclist, draining his energy. Another feature of the setting was the desert and the high temperatures. This caused the cyclist to become dehydrated. ""Trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state"" and ""I could drop from heatstroke"" show me how hot the cyclist was, and how the environment threatened his physical well-being. One final feature that has on effect on the cyclist was the old abandoned factory. The sight of the boy with a refreshing glass of juice makes the cyclist lose hope and he doubts he will survive. ""I hung my head"" and ""abandoned factory of juices and dreams"" tell how the cyclist lost all hope at the sight of the building, a symbol of what he desperately needed but could not have. All of these features of the setting have negative affects on the cyclist, both physically and mentally, making his journey increasingly arduous."
1206	7186	3	3	The setting of the area where the cyclist was biking effects him because it makes him weaker. Since the cyclist takes the long route, He is in the desert for a longer period of time. Being in extreme heat can cause a person to suffer from major dehydration. We know this was the case for the cyclist because he says, ìÖbut not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. Iíd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirstÖî This quote is saying that the cyclist put stones in his mouth to get his mind off of how thirsty he was. I think this quote is explaining exactly how dehydrated the cyclist actually was. If he was willing to put filthy stones in his mouth to help him get through his dehydration, he was pretty thirsty. Another thing that effected how thirsty the cyclist got was how hard he worked which was also a feature of the setting since during the end of his trip, he met rough terrain, he exerted more energy which made him sweat even more than he was. This made him even more dehydrated. This story is explaining how the features of your environment can either make or break you.
1207	7187	3	3	There are several features of the setting which affect the cyclist; one is the fact that he is traveling on a hot day in June. ìand the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.î The heat was getting to the cyclist and he was scared he might get heatstroke. The terrain was also not very ideal for a cyclist on a hot day. ìI noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î The cyclist was tired and the hills were making it worse. ìThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.î The cyclist was running out of water quickly and there was nowhere close to get more. These glitches in the setting affected the cyclist because it was extremely hot, he was running out of water and there was rough terrain. The setting was not in the cyclist's favor, contributing to a challenging and potentially dangerous ride.
1208	7188	3	3	According to the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit'' the features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One way the features of the setting affects the cyclist is that the mountains make the cyclist more tired. Especially because he has no water, then having to go up and down hills really wears the cyclist out and causing him to lead into dehydration faster. The relentless inclines and declines of the mountain road drain his energy, amplifying the effects of his thirst. The features of the setting affected him in that sense. Also the snake affected the cyclist. The snake, appearing suddenly on the road, caused the cyclist to be afraid which added to the fact that the cyclist was dehydrating. The unexpected encounter introduces an element of fear and anxiety, further accelerating his body's demand for resources. Another way that the features of the setting affected the cyclist was the Welch's Grape Juice Factory. The sweet, pervasive smell emanating from the factory caused the cyclist to be even more thirsty and think about dehydration even more. The tantalizing aroma serves as a constant reminder of his parched state. In the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî the features of setting affect the cyclist a lot.
1209	7189	3	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist because in the story the character makes it seem like horrible weather; for example, when he said, ""wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt,"" this is one way the setting affects the cyclist because it almost like your in the story and you can imagine what the character is going through because everything is written in details. The oppressive heat clearly impacts his physical state, making the ride more challenging and highlighting the harshness of the environment, ultimately affecting his experience."
1210	7190	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it makes it hard for him to get to ì@CAPS1 National Parkî. He took advice from some old men to take a shortcut to get him where he wanted to be. On his ride there, he stopped at a ìtownî, which was, to him, considered a ghost town; buildings were boarded up and dust devils danced in the deserted streets. Then he got to a Welchís Grape Juice Factory, but it was abandoned years earlier, its peeling paint a testament to time, and he was becoming weak and dehydrated. He thought he would drop from a heatstroke, the sun beating down mercilessly. At the end of his ride, he reached a fish camp where he gratefully found water to drink. A man asked him where he was going, and the cyclist told him. Then the man asked him, ìKnow the best way to get there?î The man was much older than the other old men that gave the cyclist advice. So the cyclist, now wiser, told the man ìyes, sir: I own a very good mapî. The cyclist realized, throughout the harsh and misleading setting on his journey, that he would never accept advice from old-timers again.
1211	7191	3	3	In the essay ìDo Not Exceed posted Speed Limitî the setting affected the cyclist’s sense of direction. The cyclist knew where he was going and how to get there, a route likely familiar and efficient, but the old men offered their ìshort-cut.î It ruined his own sense of direction because he was taking out-dated directions from ìold-timers that hadnít left their porches since Carter was in office.î Consequently, the landscape, usually a reliable guide, became a source of confusion as he followed their antiquated advice, proving how the specific setting, influenced by these long-stationary figures, negatively impacted the cyclist's journey.
1212	7192	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. I say that because when there is peace and calmness in the environment, it motivates you more to push yourself and enjoy the ride. That is certainly more helpful than when there is a lot going on around you, like noise and distractions, which can be unsettling and impede performance. Therefore, the setting's tranquility undoubtedly played a role in the cyclist's experience.
1213	7193	3	3	Steep mountains, rolling roads, jagged rocks – are all reasons why the setting is affected towards the cyclist. Well the cyclist needs to know what is going on and what will happen in April. For example “Rough Rough: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This setting leads to a lot of changes. So yes the setting does reveal a lot and I guess it describes how the cyclist will react to it also. So yes I think the settings do affect the cyclist through this whole story.
1214	7194	3	3	What l believe that the features of the setting affect the cyclist is that, the old guys in the story remember things back how they used to be but as they say in the book the world is a fluid place things change all the time. So for the cyclist to find his way he had to try and put together the pieces the old guys gave him, knowing the landscape they recalled was no longer entirely accurate. This meant relying on fragmented memories of a past environment. Ultimately, the cyclist's journey depended on reconciling past recollections with the present reality.
1215	7195	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because you wouldn't put the cyclist in the rain or he wouldn't be able to ride the bike as easily, due to the slippery conditions. Another consideration is you wouldn't have the setting be a city when there is nothing around but trees and rivers; the cyclist would need appropriate terrain like trails or roads to navigate the natural environment effectively. Therefore, the setting needs to logically support the cyclist's activity.
1216	7196	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist is that on his way he had to deal with so many things. Like for ex he had trouble with the flat roads that was replaced by short, rolling hills, making the ride more physically demanding. The next thing was there was a sign that was posted he could not ride @NUM1 he had to do @NUM2 and that made him disappointed because it forced him to take a detour. Then a large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of him, causing a moment of fear and delay. He became dehydrated from the exertion and heat. He became sad, hopeless but still had energy to feel himself, showing the psychological impact of the challenging environment, demonstrating how the combined physical and emotional strain tested his resolve.
1217	7197	3	3	There are several features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. One feature is the desert he is biking through. The heat of a desert in June can easily dehydrate someone. When exposed for a long time, exercising, and running out of water, the effect is even greater, potentially leading to heatstroke. In addition, the change in terrain and road surface would have an effect on the cyclist. Traveling on a flat road requires much less effort then climbing hills. If the road is also rough, the biker has to work even harder to push up the hill, expending precious energy. There is also the mental effort of not tipping the bike on the uneven surface, requiring constant focus. Finally, there are not any buildings in sight. When someone is dehydrated but has no water, they are desperate to find some. However, if there is nothing they know of nearby, they will start to lose hope. Once they lose hope they won’t try as hard to keep going and they will lose some of their strength, making the physical challenges even more difficult to overcome. Considering all of the things negatively affecting the cyclist, it is amazing that he managed to push through and reach a source of water, demonstrating incredible resilience.
1218	7198	3	3	The setting in the short story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie is troubling to the cyclist. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the tamest mule greeted me,” made him troubled that he was in the middle of nowhere, a place that seemed desolate and uncared for. The quote, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” shows that he was troubled by having to go over the hills, a change in the landscape that presented a physical challenge. As you can see the setting, both in its isolation and its changing topography, was very influential to the cyclist, contributing to his sense of unease and the increasing difficulty of his ride.
1219	7199	3	3	In the essays, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him hope. The cyclist takes directions by a few old men on a porch. The directions, delivered with slow certainty, seem incorrect at first, leading him further into the isolated landscape. The skeletal remains of a Grape Juice factory, a monument to faded industry, make it seem like he will never find civilization. Yet, even in this desolation, the openness of the road and the sheer possibility of what lies ahead fuels his determination, ultimately shaping his hopeful outlook.
1220	7200	3	3	"The features of the setting around the cyclist affected him to the point of exhaustion and dehydration. The cyclist being exhausted and dehydrated, or tired and thirsty, was beginning to wear as the setting went from being flat to many ups and downs. The cyclist explained the change by saying, ""flat road was replaced by short rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist’s idea presented here is that he was to find new challenges when riding the hills of this Californian desert roller coaster. His water supply was thinning from the heat, and the hills were tiring him beyond reason. Each climb felt steeper than the last, and the sun beat down relentlessly. All this cyclist could hope for was the blessing of a water refill and the shade of a puffy cloud, providing a brief respite from the harsh conditions that were quickly draining his strength and resolve."
1221	7201	3	3	The setting effected the cyclist severly. Biking in the desert, the relentless sun beating down and following outdated directions, nearly got him killed due to dehydration and exhaustion. He also came across several broken down factories and desolate, abandoned towns, their hollow shells a stark reminder of forgotten dreams, causing more dismay. However, he came across a last dusty, isolated stop that saved his life, offering him water and shelter, and ultimately allowing him to recover and continue his journey.
1222	7202	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î the cyclist is affected by his surrounding. At first the man starts out at a reservoir camp ground. His confidence is high, and he is ready to continue his adventure, fueled by optimism and ample supplies. As the day went on and all he could find was abandoned buildings he began to worry a bit; water running low, he come upon ìone ram shackled shed, several rusty pumpsî no sign of life. He realized that his trip was going to be rough, far more challenging than initially anticipated. The environment and risk of death gave him the determination he needed to push forward. Although he was fearful of death from dehydration, he knew ìtravelling through the high deserts of California in Juneî his only chances of survival was to keep going, to relentlessly pedal onward. The man's surroundings were what had pushed him to keep biking until he found the fish camp. If he had not been so aware of his surroundings he might have given up, but not making it out of the desert to ìthe cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemiteî would be too devastating; therefore, his acute awareness and the stark reality of his environment were crucial to his perseverance and eventual success.
1223	7203	3	3	The setting affects the rider because it is very hot, which makes him thirsty. How long the road is affects his mind state, and lastly, the fact that water is in sight, and that affects him too.
1224	7204	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they change the cyclist’s mood towards the ride. For example, in the essay “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” it states, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride plan into distances I could see on the horizon.” The cyclist had to mentally divide the ride into smaller segments because he was having trouble riding since he was thirsty and the ride was very monotonous. This makes the ride seem larger, so it also makes it psychologically harder to ride. Also in the essay it states, ""One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps.” This affected the cyclist because after seeing this possible source of water and later realizing he couldn’t drink it, he felt even more parched, especially since he was running low on his own water supply. When the cyclist notices the Welch’s grape juice factory in the distance, he becomes determined to reach it, offering a tangible goal that boosts his morale. In conclusion, in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist's mood towards the ride is strongly affected by the setting's features, demonstrating how external environments can greatly impact internal states and motivations."
1225	7205	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. When he was going uphill, the increased incline made it harder for him to pedal. The hot summer day was breaking him down with its intense heat. He was getting dehydrated because he had only a little bit of water left in his bottle. It said he was trying to keep his balance in his dehydrated state. He felt like giving up because of the difficult conditions.
1226	7206	3	3	Features of the cyclist affected the cyclist in many ways. One was the heat. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ìI was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.î @CAPS1 that California is called, ìthe sunshine stateî, I can infer that it was very hot. Another feature that affected the cyclist was when he thought he could get some water but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. This is said in paragraph @NUM2. This is how features of the setting affected the cyclist, demonstrating the challenging environmental conditions he faced during his journey.
1227	7207	3	3	The setting features affected the cyclist because it was a conflict. It was a conflict because it was hot and he was lost. It was a conflict that he was hot because he had a limited amount of water, which he couldn't get anymore of because he was lost. The heat causes people to get thirsty, but he couldn't quench his thirst because he was limited in water. Another conflict was that he was lost. This was a conflict because he needed to be somewhere; he had a destination in mind, making his being lost all the more problematic.
1228	7208	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he rode through the heat-scorching desert of California, he rode over 200 miles on bike to get to Yosemite, and he almost ran out of water on the journey. What kept him going on was the promise of cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.
1229	7209	3	3	There are many ways the cyclist is affected throughout the essay by the setting. As he first enters the ìshort cutî that the old men give him he is confident. When he arrives at the first town and sees that it is like a ghost town he does not fret but continues on his journey in confidence. As he got to the second stop his lack of water began to set in, ìI got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water with all my strength. This shows he will work hard and is in need of water. The arid landscape emphasizes his growing desperation. As the cyclist passed another place with no hope of water he placed stones in his mouth because he once heard it helped get your mind off thirst; when he had just about lost hope from travelling through the hot desert with no water he found one last drive in him when he saw a store with water. Though this was a hot harsh setting it created inspiration for him to keep going and push through the hard times and survive, demonstrating the powerful influence of the environment on his perseverance.
1230	7210	3	3	The cyclist in Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit was greatly affected by the setting. There were no buildings or people to the town anywhere. This emptiness meant that there was no help from anyone and he could die without anyone knowing. Also the setting seems to be very dry and have desert like conditions; without water the cyclist would be dehydrated and could suffer from a heat stroke. Also, the setting seems to be very hot. The heat also makes the cyclist physically dehydrated and mentally considers the logic of a heat stroke at the time. Therefore, the harsh and desolate environment directly threatens the cyclist's well-being, amplifying the inherent risks of his journey.
1231	7211	3	3	The features of the setting had greatly impacted the cyclist. The heat, animals, and terrain had slowed him down throughout his journey. The heat had slowed him down because he didn't have enough water to keep his body moving normally, and the snake had slowed him down because he had to sneak around it so it wouldn't bite him. The hills had affected the cyclist because it takes a lot of energy to go up them, when he said he couldn't see anything in sight. In conclusion, the harsh environmental conditions proved to be a considerable obstacle, significantly hindering the cyclist's progress and overall experience.
1232	7212	3	3	"The arid, bare, and rough terrain of the desert affected the cyclist during his journey to Yosemite in the story “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit”. The cyclist’s expedition was hindered due to many obstacles. The dryness was a huge problem during his journey. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This excerpt explains the hot, arid climate of where he was cycling. This climate decreased the rate of travel the cyclist intended to exert. Since the cyclist was riding in the desert, there weren’t many towns present. When the cyclist did approach a town, it was abandoned. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me” (@NUM2). After riding through the desert, the cyclist would have wanted a nice rest stop, but all of them were ghost towns offering no respite. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (@NUM1). Cycling for hours in a hot desert with limited water wasn’t enough of a challenge; the flat land was replaced with hills, further taxing his energy. The cyclist is exhausted from all the other obstacles that the desert confronted him with; the rough terrain affected his journey since his rate was reduced, making progress arduous. In conclusion, many factors negatively affected the cyclist's expedition to Yosemite, prolonging the journey and adding to his physical strain. The dry, bland, and hilly terrain of the desert hindered his journey, diminishing his speed and increasing the difficulty."
1233	7213	3	3	I believe the setting of an area can affect the mind when put in certain situations. In the reading, the man is cycling and he sees no one; he is almost out of water and can't see a house or a person as far as he can see. This is scary and gives the feeling of helplessness, but if he were in @LOCATION1, perhaps a bustling city center, and passed cars, people on the street, and shops, he would be calmer. He could get water at any building along his ride; the temperature might be colder there, so he would drink less and go further. This difference in environment and accessibility would significantly alter his mood, providing comfort and reducing the feeling of isolation.
1234	7214	3	3	Well in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limits by @PERSON1 the setting affects you because if you cant see anything for miles and you are running out of water it has a psychological effect on you. You can start to panic like he did when it stopped in the old house and all that came out of the pump was battery acid. The isolation of the setting definitely amplifies the desperation. Also you don't know exactly where you are so that also affects you because you don’t know where to go or if you should turn back or what. The uncertainty of the unknown roads adds to the mental strain. If I was this person the barren features around me would have a significant effect, heightening the feelings of helplessness and anxiety.
1235	7215	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the beginning of the essay she was happy, believing she was getting a shortcut: ""I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a ìshortcutî that was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park."" He thought he knew where he was going: ""I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" When she entered the first town, ""this sight was troubling."" Getting down on her hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all her strength, she was beginning to get worried as she ran out of water; the next town was ""only eighteen miles down the road."" He was now at a dehydrated state: ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" Then he saw a building, but it was no longer open. Getting back on his bike, his thoughts had changed; he was now upset and expecting to die. He then saw a store, ""Gary and Wilbers Fish Camp."" He went in, drank cool water, and then on used his own map, rather than old guys' directions, realizing the importance of reliable information in navigating challenging environments."
1236	7216	3	3	There were many features of the setting that had affected the cyclist. One of the features was the lack of water. This had made the cyclist dehydrated and not think right. It had also made the cyclist have less energy. An example is, ìI eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.î Another feature is the heat. The heat had made the cyclist thirsty and sweaty. An example is ìI wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnít a mirageÖî The setting also featured high deserts of California in June. An example is, ìI had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.î Thus, the demanding environmental features significantly challenged the cyclist.
1237	7217	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî, there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. The first feature that affected the cyclist was the desert terrain; it was very hot, and there were no trees to provide shade. This affected the cyclist because he got very hot and thirsty. So he drank more water than usual to combat the oppressive heat. Secondly, he was running out of water because he was drinking more than usual, so he had to conserve his water, which was making him become dehydrated and weakening him. That all the towns we passed through were ghost towns with no running fresh water, so this extremely disappointed him; it also furthered his dehydration and lowered his morale. Just when the cyclist was losing hope, feeling the effects of the sun and lack of water, he found a small bait shop and got into the shade and finally got water to drink. So after all those disappointments, he found hope in the small bait shop, which gave him the strength and mental boost to continue on with his journey to Yosemite National Park, showing how the environment, both harsh and unexpectedly helpful, played a crucial role in his experience.
1238	7218	3	3	The features of the setting made the cyclist's journey even longer and more strenuous. The reason it being in such a remote area did not help. For example the people who still lived in that remote area were probably as old as the cyclist's grandparents and the directions were horrible, often contradictory and faded with time. Also, the fact that there were no new shops or areas or rest for the cyclist to go to; the water pump he found was old and nasty, covered in rust and grime, and the only building he saw was abandoned, its windows boarded up and paint peeling. Another factor was the rough terrain. It being froit the cyclist was already very fatigued by lack of water and tiredness the terrain was long, bumpy and just horrible all together, with loose gravel and steep inclines that challenged his every push. Finally, the last factor was where he was bicycling in California on a sweltering summer day and he being on a bike which had no n.c(but which bike does) did not help at all, as the sun beat down relentlessly, turning the already challenging ride into an endurance test. These are how the features affect the cyclist's journey, compounding his difficulties and pushing him to his physical and mental limits.
1239	7219	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the rougher the terrain got the more the cyclist had to strain to make it. For example, when the terrain turned to hills, the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills which caused him to use more of his energy and deplete his resources faster. Also, if the terrain was flat and smooth, the cyclist had less problems making the long journey and could maintain a steady pace. For instance, if the cyclist had less strain on him then he would not be as tired and would not drink as much water, allowing him to conserve his supplies for longer stretches. In conclusion, that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
1240	7220	3	3	He wouldn't know if he would be facing favorable weather or a difficult road. @MONTH1 might bring something bad, perhaps damage to his bike or one of his bike's wheels. He might even fall off the bike. He would get so tired that he couldn't go any more, and he might give it up. All of these uncertainties could lead to him abandoning his journey.
1241	7221	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist by the need and comfort of riding down with no infrastructure around or people. That most be the best mood: nice and cool, no cars, and just him and the beautiful sky to ride with. The open road allows for freedom and a focus on the pure enjoyment of cycling. Conversely, if there is infrastructure, he must watch for people and cars and pay attention to street signs and act accordingly. This transition from open road to populated areas highlights how the setting directly affects the cyclist's experience, shifting from tranquility and freedom to vigilance and adherence to the rules of the road. So, that's outlining how the features of the setting would affect the cyclist.
1242	7222	3	3	"In the adventures of the cyclist the setting is not only what develops the character but, that what affects how he pushes himself to not give up, even when he feels helpless. This is one example of how the cyclist is affected, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June,"" With that information you can observe how this harsh setting creates problems for him physically because his body needs water. Which he is extremely limited and doesn't savor it very well, quickly depleting his supply. These issues create the problem of dehydration, and when mentally you think you're going to die without water, you start to panic and lose control over yourself. This loss of control, stemming directly from the environment, becomes a significant obstacle for the cyclist to overcome in his journey. Ultimately, the desert's challenges not only test his physical limits but also his mental fortitude, forcing him to confront his fears and push beyond perceived limitations."
1243	7223	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. The relentless headwind slowed his pace considerably, while the rough asphalt vibrated through his handlebars, numbing his hands.
1244	7224	3	3	In ''Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed Limit'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting most of the time disappoint him. You can tell that the features of the setting disappointed him because every time he got to a town he couldn't get water. In the text it states, ''I got down on my hands & knees working the handle of the rusty water pump a for like substance oozed out followed by @NUM1 degree brackish water that tasted like battery acid.'' You know the setting disappoints him when he sees the terrain he has to cross as well. You can tell when he says ''At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridiculously large snake.'' The narrator was disappointed that he listened to the directions of the elder rather than use his map, adding to his frustration with the environment. Joe Kurmaskie does a great job of making the narrator faced with challenges and how he felt about them. These combined experiences showcase how the harsh setting consistently fails to meet the narrator's expectations, leading to his overall disappointment.
1245	7225	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist b/c the route that the cyclist was taking there was a rough road him to travel. The cyclist took bad advice from some old men that hadnít left off their porches for decades. Also, as he got into his long journey he began to notice what the advice the old men had given him was bad advice, the cyclist was headed to Yosemite & he had gotten some advice from them concerning shortcuts that proved far more challenging than the main roads would have been. This ultimately shows how the landscape and the unreliable local wisdom impacted his journey.
1246	7226	3	3	When the cyclist first set off, he was doing fine, he had plenty of water. As he kept going, and sort of got of cause, he began to come into the desert region. He was hot, and he was ruunning out of water. This was making him dehydrated, his throat parched and his energy waning. Also, seeing the tumbleweeds, and lack of vegetation probably made him even worse mentally, because he was maybe thinking he was never going to get free from that desolate landscape. When he saw the fish bate shop though, he was probably relieved that he was going to be saved, and could replenish his water supply and get back on track.
1247	7227	3	3	There are many ways that a cyclist will be affected, and one of these is the setting. The setting affects them because if it is a short, smooth setting, the ride will be easy. But if it is long, bumpy, rough roads, it will be harder to control the bike, which means that the cyclist’s job will be harder; for example, a cyclist riding on a flat, paved bike path will have a much easier time than one traversing a rocky mountain trail. This is how a cyclist is affected by his or her settings, ultimately influencing their experience and performance.
1248	7228	3	3	The cyclist ran into rough settings on the way to @ORGANIZATION1 park. The first is the town he came to was a ghost town, deserted and unnerving. Then he was running out of water when he ran by tumbleweeds, symbols of desolation, and a large snake in front of him, blocking his path. He had no more water and there were rough roads ahead, making the journey physically taxing, and he came across a juice factory, seemingly abandoned. No one was there and he was out of water, uncertain how long it would be until he came to another town. That is why I say that these harsh and desolate features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist, creating feelings of isolation, thirst, and uncertainty, all impacting his journey and resolve.
1249	7229	3	3	The features of the setting have a very negative effect on the cyclist. According to the old men the cyclist would pass by a few towns if he took the route they told him. But every town the cyclist came to was deserted. ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.î Because the towns were deserted, the cyclist's water supply was dwindling because there was no place where he could get more water. He became dehydrated and kept pushing himself to find a place where there was fresh water. ìTrying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.î Once he found some pebbles and thought about sucking on them because it helps to slow down dehydration. But he didnít because he thought he would choke on them. The setting around him also made him have negative thoughts. ìIt didnít really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.î Because the setting was a hot, deserted, desert it had a very negative effect on the cyclist. If he hadnít been running out of water I donít think that the effect of the setting would have been as bad. But because he did run out of water it made the effects much worse, amplifying his feelings of despair and hopelessness in the face of such desolation.
1250	7230	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One reason I say this is because he ran out of water, a scarcity likely caused by the arid environment, and he could dehydrate. Also, looking for water in the desolate landscape slowed him down more. Another reason I say this is because the man gave him the wrong directions, perhaps due to unfamiliarity with the confusing network of paths in the area, which got him lost and confused. That is how the setting affected the cyclist.
1251	7231	3	3	"It is said that, ""experience is a good substitute for INSTINCT."" This means if someone knows how to deal with the environment they're in they can survive even if they weren't born with the animal instinct that come with the territory. However, even the most experienced person can be overcome by the extreme weather conditions they live in. In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the experienced cyclist decides to take a long, difficult, and dangerous trip. His ride will take him a long the long desert paths of California with a limited water supply. This is the major element that challenges him in the story. Because he listened to some old men he went without water for most of his trip. Between his constant exercise, extreme heat, and lack of water, dehydration hit him fast. A common side effect of dehydration is hallucination, which the cyclist knew. It says in the essay, ""I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn`t mirage."" This represents his knowledge and experience in the matter, and showed that he was adapt to his environment through experience. A similar story to this is Jack LONDON's, ""To Build a Fire"" where the man is also pitted against extremes of nature through the Yukon, but the elements still overtook him. Both stories represents man's quest for adventure, and also the constant struggle for survival that people face."
1252	7232	3	3	The feature of a setting can affect a cyclist’s energy. In a setting with turns, hills, and headwinds, it can easily tire this cyclist out.
1253	7233	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist most on the fact that it strained him out the hydrated state. The arid climate and relentless sun made it difficult to retain fluids, and the lack of readily available water sources exacerbated the problem. It made him unable to operate at his full power/efficiency. Depleted of essential electrolytes, his muscles weakened, and his cardiovascular system struggled to keep up. It deprived him of the little energy he had in him to begin with. Facing headwinds and the constant uphill climb further compounded the energy drain. That is how the setting affected him, ultimately hindering his performance and pushing him to his physical limits.
1254	7234	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist very strongly. The desert and heat with no water cause him to get dehydrated. The rolling hills and rough terrain tire him out, making each mile a struggle. In the story it says ìand growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.î This shows that the heat and terrain could cause him to over heat and suffer a heat stroke, a very real danger given the harsh environment he's navigating. Ultimately, the setting poses a significant threat to the cyclist’s well-being.
1255	7235	3	3	The temperature of the place that the cyclist was riding through affected him very much. The temperature caused the cyclist to sweat. This affected him because he would get thirsty and eventually he ran out of water. For example in the text he says ìthe water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sipsî and then it goes on to say, ìI could drop from from a heat stroke.î This showed how it affected him because he thought he is going to drop from the heat. The intense heat, combined with the physical exertion, created a dangerous situation where dehydration became a serious threat, indicating that the cyclist's performance and well-being were significantly compromised by the environmental conditions.
1256	7236	3	3	Features of the setting affected the cyclist were the harsh & hot climate and terrain. The author clearly wrote how the sun was beating down on him and how he almost died from dehydration, further illustrating the impact with descriptions of the rough, uneven ground that made pedaling incredibly difficult. Thus, the environment presented significant challenges.
1257	7237	3	3	The features of the setting do affect the cyclist. If the road is rough you have to have the right bike, maybe one with wider tires and good suspension. Then if you get a flat tire you have to know to look out for dangerous and poisonous things, like snakes or poisonous plants, when you stop to fix it. If you were in a real bad accident you'd have to be prepared just in case they don't find you in time. You would have to know what nights were like. For example, if it got real cold at night you need to keep yourself warm, possibly by carrying extra layers or knowing how to build a makeshift shelter; therefore, understanding the environment is crucial for a cyclist's safety and preparedness.
1258	7238	3	3	The desert and the hills had a huge effect on the cyclist. The desert in June must have been very hot, and going up those hills had to be hard. The road was also very rough. It says, ìRough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.î It also says, ìI was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.î The cyclist was very thirsty because of the hot weather. The grueling conditions of the setting, the heat, the hills, and the rough road, clearly took a toll. I think the setting had a huge effect on the cyclist.
1259	7239	3	3	"The cyclist’s condition was greatly influenced by his setting because he was lost in the high deserts of California in June. The heat crippled him as he traveled in search of Yosemite. He became lost and ran out of water, making his situation worse. Being lost in seemingly the middle of nowhere in the hot heat, he became exhausted, dehydrated, and feared heat stroke and loss of consciousness. This is shown in the essay by, ""the growing realization that could drop from heatstroke"" and, ""It looked like i was going to lose concisness for the last time."" This perilous environment significantly deteriorated his physical state and mental resolve, highlighting how the harsh desert landscape directly contributed to his declining condition and fear of succumbing to the elements."
1260	7240	3	3	"How the features of the setting affected the cyclist in the story, ""Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" were very dangerous to his life. The cyclist was traveling to the Yosemite National Park on a hot summer day. The cyclist traveled miles after miles on his bike only to pass by deserted towns, ""This place might have been a thriving little spot...a ghost town."" The terrain was threatening because after twenty-two miles or so, the cyclist had to overcome, ""short rolling hills,"" which would use more energy and make his thirst for water even stronger. The cyclist was out of water and the hot day, with the sun beating down, was not helping. After a grueling journey, the cyclist used all the strength he had to go to a local bait shop and drank from the sink after the treacherous environment he was exposed to. The features of the setting in the story, ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" were life threatening and almost killed the cyclist, due to lack of water and the terrain he overcame, ultimately highlighting the perilous conditions he faced."
1261	7241	3	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist by teasing him. First it was the rippling streams that taunted his thirst, their clear water just out of reach, then the old faucet, dry and mocking, and last the welches grape factory. The streams were the beginning stage, simply provoking thirst; then came the faucet. The faucet made him realize that he was dehydrated, the metal a cold reminder of his need. And last, the abandoned Welches grape juice factory had him almost abandon hope, a symbol of sweet relief forever out of grasp. The setting was affecting his mood, turning determination into despair.
1262	7242	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in the story. In the story, it says, ìThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. I could drop from a heatstroke.ì This statement clearly says that where the cyclist was riding, water was very hard to find and scarce. He is talking about how he will die if he doesnít get water, highlighting the life-threatening aridity of the environment. Another example is that there are no buildings around and is deserted with no one around and many hills and roads. In the story it says, ìthe terrain changing flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. This means that he was partially all by himself and he had no one to go to, further isolating him in this challenging landscape. The demanding terrain coupled with the lack of resources and human presence emphasizes the cyclist's vulnerability, making the setting a crucial factor in his struggle for survival.
1263	7243	3	3	"In this story, the features of the setting heavily affect the cyclist. Certain features portray that this journey to Yosemite National Park was dreadful, but at the same time enjoyable. ""I would come to along this breeze jaunt."" The word breezy shows that the cyclist can enjoy riding the bike because there is a breeze. Another feature of the setting is very old and dirty. The water that the cyclist is drinking is drying his mouth out even more. ""A tar-like substance oozed out followed by brackish water feeling."" This shows the dirtyness of the water and the unpleasantness that accompanies it. Also, this setting shows the cyclist had to use all he had just to survive. It says ""working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength."" The struggle to obtain even basic necessities highlights the harshness of the environment. Overall, the features portray sacrifice and bravery of the cyclist, showcasing their resilience in the face of adversity."
1264	7244	3	3	"In the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The setting around the cyclist led her to drink a lot of water because of the dry conditions. ìI was traveling the hish deserts of California in Juneî This shows that most likely she was hot, sweaty, and a source of water was not near to her. The rough terrain also led to her using her own strength to get up and down hills, and to avoid plants and animals. The settings in the story led the cyclist to become dehydrated and weak; she was forced on a low supply of water and dodge numerous hazards, with no sign of living people near her. ìThis place might have been a thrivins little spot at one time say, before the last world was"" This suggests a ghost town, where no people were currently living. There was nobody around her to help. The setting led to her deteriorating health. Her physical health was in danger because of her dehydration and her lack of energy, compounded by the scorching heat of the desert environment. Her mind was also starting to wear. She had to shake her head to make sure what she was seeing in one part of the story, indicating the psychological toll exacted by the harsh and isolating landscape. Ultimately, the unforgiving setting is a major antagonist in the cyclist's journey, actively contributing to her declining condition."
1265	7245	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist. Because the man didn’t have a lot of water and he was going into the California deserts in June, the extreme heat would be a significant challenge. Another reason is because the flat road was changed into rolling hills and up ahead there was a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” the speed limit was @NUM1, making the ride physically more demanding. One more thing is make sure you don’t listen to a gentleman that is old and hadn’t been off their porch in decades, as his advice would likely be outdated and irrelevant to the current conditions of the road. That is some of the things that can affect the cyclist and ultimately impact his journey through the California desert.
1266	7246	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist since it is affecting her condition. She needs water to survive, and the next town is very far away. So she could possibly pass out without brake, with the hot temperatures exacerbating the danger. ìWhen I tried a draper I was, it had the flavor of battery acidî (Kurmaskie @NUM1). If she doesnít find water soon, it will further degrade her condition. Also, the features of the setting affect her determination. When she knows that she needs to find a town, she works harder to overcome the arid landscape. ""i would conserve my water go inward for an hour or so atleast or my inner spirit""(@NUM1). She would try her hardest to make smart moves, and make it to a town as fast as possible. She works harder since she knows without water, her life is in danger. The harsh environment thus directly impacts both her physical state and her mental resolve."
1267	7247	3	3	During the cyclist journey in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie he experiences setting changes such as the road being flat then going to short rolling hills. When he's riding, he says the road is flat. “Flat road was replaced.” This tells us the road he was on was nice and flat, offering a relatively easy ride. Then as he's riding he notices the land change. “Flat road was replaced by, short rolling hills.” This tells us that the cyclist will have more trouble since the terrain changed, introducing an element of challenge that demands more physical exertion. The shift from flat to rolling hills foreshadows the increasing difficulty of his journey.
1268	7248	3	3	The features affect the cyclist. The setting affects the cyclist because it's real hot. So he takes a couple tips on some short cuts by some old men. Then come to find out these tips weren't really short cuts. So now he's riding and angry that he took their tips. Also he's running out of water and becoming dehydrated. He sees an abandoned place with water, but in order to get it you need to pump it. So he starts pumping and sees black gunk. He pumps for about 20 minutes to cool the water, but it doesn't cool off. Come to find out the water tastes like battery acid. So he starts riding again, but encounters a snake. Luckily he gets away, but he feels that he's about to die and regrets listening to men who haven't got off their porch since Eisenhower was president. What makes him more angry is that they seemed so sure. As he's riding he sees a juice factory and goes there. Now it's a fishing store and drinks lots and lots of water. He also says he's never listening to old men and he'll always use the map, deciding that trusting his own navigation is the only way to avoid such mishaps in the future.
1269	7249	3	3	As the author of the story goes on her bike trip, the landscape around her becomes less and less welcoming. The first thing the cyclist encounters is a rusty pump and old shed. When the cyclist tries to get water from the pump, she describes the water as very hot and not cooling down at all. When the cyclist continues, tumbleweeds that look like “diamond head snakes” cross her path. She encounters no buildings for a long time; when she does encounter a building, it is abandoned and suggests that people left because of the landscape. The paint is peeling, the windows are boarded, and a sense of desolation hangs heavy in the air, reinforcing the idea of nature’s dominance. The cyclist encounters another elderly man in her journey but decides not to take his advice because of the path the last set of elderly men set her down. Distrust now colors her interactions, a direct consequence of the harsh environment and the misleading guidance she previously received, leading her to rely solely on her own instincts despite the inherent challenges.
1270	7250	3	3	"The features of the surrounding setting affect the cyclist's performance; for example, in the essay ""Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting is full of hills, twisting, rising, and descending. These inclines and declines work against the cyclist's energy, demanding considerable exertion. Also, the scarcity of people in towns makes it difficult and depriving for the cyclist to find a water supply, increasing the risk of dehydration, further hindering their ability to continue. Third, the weather in the essay significantly affects the cyclist; the intense heat of the California desert necessitates constant hydration for the cyclist to endure the ride. Thus, the environment plays a crucial role in determining the cyclist's experience and overall performance."
1271	7251	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways; they face heat, lack of water, and hills. While on his journey, he almost gets dehydrated because he does not have a good supply of water, and he said they taste ""like battery acid."" He had to continue up the road for another @NUM1 miles so that he could finally replenish himself with fresh water and continue his ride, relieved to have overcome the challenging conditions."
1272	7253	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by hurting his ability to keep going. In this story the cyclist was faced with many setbacks or problems. At first he took advice from a very old man who had out-of-date directions, sending him further off course. Then, the cyclist thought he could keep going on a very limited water supply, underestimating the harshness of the terrain. The cyclist then was getting dehydrated and angry as the sun beat down relentlessly. The cyclist then found an old building which raised his hopes, only to drop them once he found out it was closed and rundown, offering no respite. Finally, he finds a store and then hydrates and is on his way again, but the grueling environment has clearly taken a toll. All these environmental factors combined to significantly hinder the cyclist's progress and tested his resolve.
1273	7254	3	3	I think features affect the cyclist because when you ride a bicycle you need to consider appropriate details based on those features. This consideration ensures a comfortable and efficient experience. Therefore, understanding how different features impact the rider is important for optimal cycling.
1274	7255	3	3	"In the story ìRough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist has a very long journey that itís affected by a variety of things, and problems. The cyclist is confident with himself at the beginning but after a few moments he feels really bad, and learns a really good lesson. ìI eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,"" the cyclist shows that it is really hard for him to move without water. This quote shows that he is not only thirsty but dehydrated which is several for a human being. The cyclist also had a really bad time, because he had to taste stones in order to make his thirst go away, one example of that is when he was struggling to find water; the desperation is evident in his actions. The experience, though difficult, ultimately taught him a valuable lesson about preparation and respecting the limits of his body, leading to personal growth."
1275	7256	3	3	In the essay, ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î a cyclist is confronted with a troubling setting on his journey to Yosemite. He is led away from the steady road as a result of taking mislead advice from an old group of individuals. In this essay the setting plays a crucial impact on the cyclist. In the essay, the author sets up the story describing the day as, ìtraveling through the high deserts of California in June.î Because of the amount of heat the cyclist was enduring, he became weary and dehydrated, impacting his physical and mental state. Alone with this, the cyclist had to work much harder because the man noticed, ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î This setting is a major setback to the cyclistís journey, and required him to persevere through the difficult terrain and weather conditions. In my life there have been numerous obstacles which I have had to persevere through. One of which had been when I was out camping, and suddenly, as in the essay, the setting changed, and a storm came, bringing heavy rain and strong winds. Though the other campers and I did what we needed to to make the best out of it, securing our tents and finding shelter. In the essay, the cyclist is affected greatly by the setting. This was the same in my experience as the setting affected myself. In both situations, perseverance led to a final satisfaction of the journey, allowing us to overcome adversity and appreciate the rewards that followed.
1276	7257	3	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because the roads are bumpy, making for an uncomfortable ride. The other thing that is effecting the cyclist is the water on the roads, which creates slippery conditions. There are a lot of curved roads which always slows down his speed, impacting his overall time. Therefore, the cyclist's performance is significantly hindered by these environmental obstacles.
1277	7258	3	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting is described as a rough terrain, which makes it harder for the cyclist to travel. Also itís hot, and there are no buildings or people around. This also makes it hard for the cyclist because he runs out of water. Throughout the story the cyclist keeps going and ends up starving, further highlighting the harsh impact of the desolate environment on his well-being and perseverance.
1278	7259	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the surrounding is perceived negatively. Everything around the cyclist is perceived negatively, so naturally the cyclist feels like the task is harder and more challenging than it really is. For example, nothing is surrounding the cyclist but sand and the hot temperature since the setting is so empty and no one is around, then everything seems harder than it really is. The sun beats down mercilessly, the sand offers no respite, and the vast emptiness amplifies the feeling of isolation. Also the cyclist feels like he can't go on and is weak because there is no life around him. The absence of visual stimulation and encouragement further depletes his motivation. Furthermore, if the cyclist was in the park with the sun shining and people around and in sight, his attitude would change and everything would seem easier. The lush greenery, the cheerful faces, and the sounds of laughter would create a positive feedback loop, making the ride feel less strenuous and more enjoyable, demonstrating how crucial setting is to perceived effort.
1279	7260	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making it hard for him to control his bike down the rough road, the incline and uneven terrain adding to the difficulty. It was also hotter than he anticipated, making him thirsty and causing him to run out of water sooner than expected. There wasn't a building in sight, so he couldn't get anything to drink or find respite from the sun. Adding to his predicament, he also didn't know where he was going, increasing his anxiety. These challenging features of the setting significantly impacted the cyclist's journey, compounding his physical and mental strain.
1280	7261	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many grueling and harsh ways. First, the lack of civilization contributes to an uneasy feeling and an inability to refill his water bottle. Second, the heat and uphill climbs are taking their toll on both the cyclist's physical and mental strength. Third, his water bottle is emptying at an alarming rate due to his thirst and relentless heat. In paragraph four the exhausted cyclist reaches the first ''town.'' This place *may* have been a striving spot, but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. *As* he came to a house with a rusty water pump, which spewed out brackish, near-boiling water, which did not support the parched cyclist, physically or mentally, thus adding to his distress.
1281	7262	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because ìnever accept travel advice from someone who hasn't actually cycled the route themselves."" This is especially true because the setting's hills can be brutal, the wind relentless, and the poorly maintained roads jarring. Therefore, firsthand experience is crucial for accurate route assessment."
1282	7263	3	3	"The setting of the story affects the cyclist in a negative way. He entrusted that these men he had asked directions from knew what they were talking about. With the directions in mind, he traveled on his way to his destination, pushing onward with a hopeful spirit. Only to find deserted towns, disowned factories, and unrelenting hills stretching before him. With all this being the ""high deserts of California in June,"" the harsh environment began to take its toll. With all these aspects, the cyclist was worn out and dehydrated, his initial optimism fading as the sun beat down. He found himself saying ""I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst,"" desperately shaving his deep name of thirst. After finally finding a place to get a drink, he stated, ""I had an overwhelming need to buy some bait,"" showing his deep gratitude and relief of finding water, highlighting the desperation the unforgiving landscape had instilled in him. The setting, therefore, serves as a formidable antagonist, testing the cyclist's resilience and underscoring the importance of reliable information when navigating such a challenging environment."
1283	7264	3	3	"In the story ìDo not exceed posted speed limit"" The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. One way is that the harsh conditions of the desert make him need alot of water resources. This is because the heat and exercise will dehydrate him. This is evident in the story because after he drinks all his water, he is desperate enough to try to drink out of an old pump that had black sludge in it. The unrelenting sun and arid landscape intensify his thirst, pushing him to take extreme measures. This illustrates how the features of the setting affected the cyclist."
1284	7265	3	3	"While trying to reach Yosemite by a shortcut, the cyclist faced many challenges and emotions. The cyclist started out his journey cheerfully with thoughts of the cool pines of Yosemite. ""The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it."" The cyclist continued on, his spirits as well as his water supply going down. The cyclist encouraged himself to keep going, just to find an open building, telling himself that if he could make it that far, he'd be fine. Passing many abandoned factories, the cyclist tried many methods to decrease his thirst, including sucking on stones, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope. After passing the abandoned factories, the cyclist found a deserted building, and he lost more and more hope. When the cyclist found an open store with modern bathrooms, he had ""an overwhelming urge to seek out anyone, kiss them, and buy some bait."" At the end, the cyclist promised himself to always use his map, having learned a hard lesson about the importance of planning and preparation."
1285	7266	3	3	In the essay, ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Kurmaskie, the cyclist went through hard times, trying to get to Yosemite National Park. A cyclist is someone who rides their bike mostly all the time to get somewhere. First off, the cyclist asked old men for directions to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist knew that was a mistake in the first place, but he had hope that maybe they knew what they were talking about, though their advice proved unhelpful. Secondly, on his trip, he came across a ìGhost townî with nothing in sight but a bike snake. The cyclist became dehydrated and was running out of water, the only water he had was diminishing quickly, making the journey even more perilous. These challenges highlight the unexpected difficulties that can arise when pursuing a goal, emphasizing the need for preparation and resilience.
1286	7267	3	3	Well some features might have more prominence than others, and the cyclist might face more challenges than the author in certain aspects of the journey. Also the author faced a lot of problems like the scarcity of water, the presence of poisonous snakes, and the poor condition of the road. So there were many things that affected both the author and the cyclist, significantly impacting their experience as they were on their arduous journey. These factors highlight the demanding nature of the trip and the various obstacles that had to be overcome.
1287	7268	3	3	In the passage ìDo not exceed posted speed limit,î there are many features from the setting that affected the cyclist. One feature that affected the cyclist was the snake he encountered on his way, for example in the text it says ìAt some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snakeî, ìI cased post, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated stateî This proves that the snake was a feature that affected the cyclist by requiring him to maintain composure. Even in a dehydrated state, the cyclist had to focus and react to the unexpected obstacle. This demonstrates how the environment introduced challenges that impacted his physical and mental state, influencing his journey.
1288	7269	3	3	"There are many things that could have made his bicycle ride much more enjoyable, one thing is if he wasn't in the middle of nowhere and if he actually knew where he was. For example, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" Therefore, he had almost no water to get him through the day. For instance, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" Moreover, he did not know where he was going so it was harder for him, because he was lost and disoriented. In conclusion these are some things that made his trip hard."
1289	7270	3	3	The features of the setting do affect the cyclist in such ways, making him illusionistic and dehydrated. He saw the illusion that a juice factory was working, when it was abandoned. He saw rusty pipes; this made him dehydrated because he knew those pipes could never produce water, further contributing to his disorientation and physical distress, thus highlighting the powerful influence of the desolate environment.
1290	7271	3	3	In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the settings of the story affect the cyclist, making him think he will die and overall making him worried. In the story, the cyclist takes two old men’s advice on the best way to get to Yosemite mountain and gets himself in the middle of nowhere. He finds himself in the California desert without water, and he lets this go to his head. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean,” that line was from the last page of the story. The biker was taking an unfamiliar route, and he let himself believe he would die. He knew he was in the desert without water; the setting makes him nervous because he was in a desert. He wouldn’t have been nearly as nervous if he was in a forest where there are streams. He lets the desert and the heat convince him that he is going to die. By coming across ghost towns, he believes he will never see another person again; he gets older because of where he is. He thinks the heat will kill him. The setting affects him and tricks him into believing he is going to die, showcasing how the environment can significantly impact one's mental state and perception of danger.
1291	7272	3	3	The feature of the setting including the conditions, weather, and amount of water can possibly decide the life or death of the cyclist. The conditions such as hills, and rocky roads can decide a future for a cyclist because if the rocky roads turn you off balance you could fall down a hill and give yourself an injury or possibly die. For example, in the short story it says, “over one long crippling hill, a building came into view” This shows the conditions in which the cyclist had to deal with. In addition, the weather and amount of water can also decide the future. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” This shows us that if the cyclist gets dehydrated enough he could pass out and no one would find him in the desert. The scorching heat further exacerbates the situation, as it accelerates dehydration and exhaustion, potentially leading to a fatal outcome in such an isolated environment. In addition, the heat isn’t helping him out any once he could die without anyone knowing. These reasons show us a cyclist needs to make sure they have enough water and the conditions and weather is right so they don’t make a life-threatening choice.
1292	7273	3	3	When the cyclist is at his low point, he is an abandoned ghost town, looking for water that tastes like battery acid. The cyclist feels hopeless in the abandoned town. When he first reaches the water pump and the abandoned juice building he has a little hope, a flicker of possibility in the desolate landscape, only to be let down, because the building has no juice and the water pumpís water is too hot and the water is not any good. The setting is the reason his mood changes throughout the story, dictating his emotional state with its promise and subsequent disappointment. The environment actively shapes his hope and despair, revealing the profound impact of surroundings on one's emotional well-being.
1293	7274	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist, influencing their ride and requiring adjustments. Different elements, such as snow or rocks, directly impact a cyclist's ability to maintain balance and control. For instance, patches of ice can cause a cyclist to lose traction, leading to a fall. Similarly, a road filled with rocks demands careful navigation and slower speeds to avoid accidents or damage to the bicycle. Ultimately, the cyclist's experience is shaped by the setting, necessitating adaptability and awareness to overcome environmental challenges.
1294	7275	3	3	"In the beginning of the story, a young cyclist sets out on a long journey to Yosemite National Park. Along his ride he meets some old but confident men who suggest a new route, which they claim ""was to slice away hours"" from his ride. The setting was exceedingly hot that July. He was supposed to encounter a few thriving towns along the way, but the first was a ""barren ghost town,"" the next had water ""the flavor of battery acid,"" then he came to an abandoned Welch's grape juice factory. The author navigated through a very trying setting until he reached a bait shop. The advice that he gives to his readers is to stick to your guns & don't let old timers try and change your mind, because sometimes the well-intentioned shortcut leads to a far more difficult path."
1295	7276	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road aheadî by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist had many challenges due to the harsh desert setting. The cyclist was lost, and this affected him a lot because the desert is very hot, with temperatures capable of causing heatstroke. He could have died from either dehydration or exhaustion while trying to find his way back. Also, in the desert some animals can be very dangerous on the cyclist journey; he saw a poisonous snake slithering across his path. It was a good thing that he was cautious around the snake because if he hadnít been, he might have gotten bitten, and there would be no one around to help him administer aid. The desert that he was in also happened to be deserted, and there was no one around to help him with directions, compounding his sense of isolation. The worst thing would have to be that he ran out of water, his most vital resource. Without the water, he could become very weak and dehydrated and could have even died from the exposure. The setting of where the cyclist was affected him greatly, posing significant threats to his survival.
1296	7277	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him thirsty and him thinking he is lost and going to die. The cyclist, parched and sun-beaten, got information from an old guy that has not been off his porch for years. Just when the cyclist thought he was lost he saw ìGary and Wilberís fish camp-if you want bait for the big ones, were your best bet!î The cyclist went in and got water, and the old man asked him if he wanted to know where to go, but this time he said no, confident he could find his own way.
1297	7278	3	3	"In the short story ""Do not exceed the speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting has a great impact on the cyclist. In the beginning of the story he describes the scenery as ""rolling golden hills."" As he continued following the old men's outdated advice, it led him through more barren lands. When he came to the first ""town"" he described it as a ghost town. The second setting he arrived at was ""one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule."" He continued moving to the next town, which was 40 miles away; he came to what he thought was a Welch's Grape juice factory and bottling plant. This took a toll on his confidence because he said ""I hung my head."" He moved on and had finally arrived at an abandoned building called ""Ernie and Wilbur's Fish Camp."" This is where he drank water and became replenished. The setting had a great effect on the cyclist, because, depending on the location, it decided whether he would live or die in the hot deserts of California, showcasing how the environment dictated his survival."
1298	7279	3	3	One of the main things that affect the cyclist is the heat, causing dehydration. Due to the heat he drinks all of his water, leaving him vulnerable to its effects. Another feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the rough road; since he is so tired, he has a difficult time riding on the hills and other hard road conditions, further depleting his energy. These environmental challenges clearly impede the cyclist's progress.
1299	7280	3	3	"In the story, ""I Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" written by @CAPS1, the setting reflects how the cyclist is feeling. For example, ""Flat roads was replaced by short, riding hills"" @CAPS2 as the terrain was changing, so was his attitude. When he first started the journey, he was happy and care free and the land had no hills and was flat. However, once he noticed that everything is not as the men said, he seems to grow a little angry and upset, @CAPS2 like the land seemed to reflect this; soon he found himself on a bumpy and unpleasant road. The setting also seemed to give the man more obstacles to overcome on his adventure; ""tumbleweeds crossed my path; a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the movement in front as me."" It appeared the land was actively working against him. The land seemed to be teasing and tormenting him, when he started to figure out that listening to the old men was a mistake, showcasing how the environment mirrors his internal struggles and the increasing difficulty of his journey. Ultimately, the setting serves as a powerful symbol of the cyclist's emotional state and the challenges he faces."
1300	7281	3	3	In the story ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affects the cyclist by draining him of energy, he is sweating so much, he keeps on drinking his water and slowly finishes it and still has a long ride ahead of him. ìThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.î(Kurmaskieís) since is was so hot the cyclist was thirsty and drank all of his water. It was a warm day and he needed to stay hydrated; the sun beat down relentlessly on the black asphalt, radiating heat that intensified the physical strain, and the relentless warmth contributes to the cyclist's growing desperation, making the remaining journey seem even more daunting. The cyclist’s struggle highlights the setting's impact.
1301	7282	3	3	In the book ëDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie the setting was in Codi, California. The author went on a journey
1302	7283	3	3	Throughout the rider's long journey, the setting greatly affected him. For example, the hot weather caused him to drink the majority of the water supply, making him dehydrated and tired; consequently, his pace slowed considerably. If the weather was cool, he would have lasted much longer and likely arrived at his destination with more energy, demonstrating the profound impact of environmental conditions on his endurance.
1303	7284	3	3	"In this story, the cyclist was affected physically and emotionally in many ways, one such way being through the setting around him. For example, when he rode into the first town, he gained a boost of confidence because he believed he was on the right track to Yosemite. Then, when the cyclist rode upon that old shed and the rusty water pumps, he began to feel a little worried because he was running out of water, and The Old Timers never mentioned the shed. When the cyclist encountered the rolling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes, I believe he began to feel dismayed because he was lost, and the harsh environment was taking its toll. I believe this because, in the text, he says, ""I was going to die, and the birds would pick me dead,"" which shows how hopeless the man felt in the face of the unforgiving landscape. When he reached ""Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp,"" he was relieved and thankful because he no longer had death blazing towards him in the form of a yellow sun, empty spaces, and an empty water bottle. This illustrates how the features and setting affected him in many ways, influencing his emotional state as he navigated the challenging terrain."
1304	7285	3	3	Riding through beastly mountains and hot, burning deserts with no water, a cyclist was riding through a town and asked for directions. The two old men gave him the wrong directions, sending him on a trip through hell that only a determined person could get through. First, he had to go miles without water, which resulted in him losing faith, becoming dehydrated, and almost giving up on continuing with his plans. The terrain he had to go through was unbearable and could almost kill him without water. Luckily, he had faith and determination, so he got through it and learned a lesson: maps are made for people to use, so if you have a map, you should trust it. In the ending, it shows that the cyclist learned that because he said, “And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future,” proving the importance of trusting reliable sources like maps.
1305	7286	3	3	In the short story “Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit,” a lot of things affected the cyclist. Such as the rocky road and the lack of water, for example, where the author says, “when I tried a drop or two, It had the flavor of battery acid.” This shows how he is losing hope, and he seems a little scared. The cyclist’s dwindling water supply and its putrid taste significantly impacted his morale, adding to his mounting anxieties, also, the abandoned towns didn’t help. The desolate landscape and decaying infrastructure amplified his sense of isolation and vulnerability, making his journey even more psychologically taxing. Thus, the combined effects of physical hardship and unsettling surroundings contributed to the cyclist’s growing despair.
1306	7287	3	3	All the features of the environment through which the cyclist is riding affect him greatly. First, since he is riding through the desert in June, that means that it is very hot out and he will need plenty of water for his long bike ride. Also, the terrain of which he is riding is rough which causes him to lose energy. The sun was also beginning to beat down on him which means that he was going to have a hot ride to the town and which later caused his struggle for water. Overall, the hot, desert setting affects the cyclist, causing him to dehydrate and have a need for water. In the story it says, ìThe water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sipsî and that he could drop from a heatstroke on a beautiful day in June.î This is basically showing that the hot environment caused him to drink a lot of water, and now he has run low which could cause him to have a heat stroke, highlighting the perilous impact of the harsh desert environment on his well-being.
1307	7288	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by depleting his water supply and almost giving him heat exhaustion. In the text, he says: “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This hotness means he has little water left for survival until he runs out; the arid landscape and relentless sun are actively working against him, pushing him closer to dehydration and physical collapse.
1308	7289	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. At first it was flat road which the speaker was happy with and he had ìa smile on.î Then came large rolling hills which created a challenge, the cyclist needed to muster up enough energy to continue. The rough terrain was next causing the cyclist to work even harder to cycle. As if the rough terrain wasnít energy soaking enough, a snake blocked a majority of pavement and large elevations came into play. The harder the terrain, the harder for the cyclist, clearly demonstrating the environment's direct influence on the cyclist's experience and exertion.
1309	7290	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because depending on how the setting is, is how much skill they need. Like if they're going downhill then they really only need to know how to control the bike. If they're going up a mountain with lots of bumps they need to have some skill, and the right gear. Usually if they're riding in a shady area then they wear clothes to keep them cool, and protect them from any potential moisture. But if they're going to be in the sun then they need to wear light clothes, and apply sunscreen. The setting affects the rider very much, influencing their clothing, gear, and the level of skill required for a safe and successful ride.
1310	7291	3	3	"The setting in ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"" affects the cyclist in many ways. The old men told the cyclist there were flat roads on the path he was to take, when the cyclist got there, there were hills not flat roads. The cyclist traveled through the desert to get to his destination. He started to run out of water because it was so hot and humid. He started to get dehydrated and could barely keep his balance. In this story the cyclist had to pass a large snake, ""a ridiculously large"" snake that ""really didn't look like a diamondback,"" blocked a majority of the pavement in front of me (Kurmaskie). The snake's imposing size forced the cyclist to navigate carefully. The cyclist had to work his best to pass it while wobbling from dehydration. The settings in this story significantly impacted the cyclist, contributing to his physical struggle and challenging his journey."
1311	7292	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many readers after another. @CAPS1 are some examples why the cyclist was bike riding down a windy road. He is in a hot place similar to a desert, and the intense heat is affecting his stamina during his travels, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" Another thing that affected him because of the setting was that the desert had rocky roads and windy paths because he followed the old mans direction. ""Rough Road Ahead"" A final example is that he was in the desert so he saw a snake come out of the tumbleweeds, ""A large snake it really did look like a diamond back."" @CAPS1 are three examples how the cyclist had been affected due to the setting of the story; these examples illustrate how the desert environment significantly impacts the cyclist's journey, presenting challenges related to heat, terrain, and wildlife."
1312	7293	3	3	"The features in the settings, like hills, make the cyclist use more energy; the more energy that he uses, the more water he will want to drink. This is difficult because he states, ""The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips."" Therefore he was in trouble, especially given the increasing exertion. This lack of hydration threatened his performance and well-being, making the challenging terrain even more daunting."
1313	7294	3	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he is in the desert and it is very hot outside. Also he is running out of water. This is bad because he could become dehydrated, impairing his judgment and physical strength. Another example is when he comes upon the building he thinks it is a mirage at first because he’s pretty much dehydrated, causing him to hallucinate. The rough terrain also makes it hard for him to pedal and he is already weak from lack of water, slowing his progress considerably. In conclusion all these elements of the desert affect the cyclist in some way.
1314	7295	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist’s mood towards the journey. At first, he is confident that the old men’s knowledge of the land is accurate and he is excited about what lies ahead for him. However, his excitement soon turned into dismay and slight doubt as his journey drags on and the landscape offers no respite. The heat of the weather and lack of water makes the cyclist develop an uncaring matter. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps…with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” The verbal irony in this passage delivers a negative feeling to the reader and it is here that it is clear that the cyclist doesn’t care what happens to him. When he finally reaches a sign of civilization, a gas station, the cyclist becomes himself again and decides that his knowledge is best, suggesting the harsh environment had temporarily broken his spirit, but his self-assurance returns with comfort.
1315	7296	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” while riding his bike the author Joe Kurmaskie has a long ride. Where he is riding there are up and down hills also the road is very rough. He was running out of water in the desert. “I stopped at a rusted water pump to get water and a tar-like substance oozed out.” Once he is off his bike, he least worries about the poisonous snakes of the desert. He found a Welch’s grape juice factory but it was abandoned. The author found a bait shop and got water, showing his resourcefulness in a challenging environment.
1316	7297	3	3	"In the short story ""Do not @CAPS1 the Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways. In the story the cyclist experiences many changes in temperature and climate, going from arid heat to cooler elevations. He also experiences changes in land structure, with steep inclines making it extremely hard to pedal and progress, testing his physical endurance. This ever-shifting environment, with its demanding terrain and fluctuating weather, is why the setting @MONTH1 affects the cyclist so profoundly."
1317	7298	3	3	"The hot sun and the desert features in the setting are affect the cyclist in ways that could potentially stop him from making it to his destination. The sun is beating down on him and is making it harder for him to reach his destination. ìThe sun was begining to beat down...wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.î By him being so hot and tired from the sun, he thought that he would die from dehydration. This would very likely stop him from making it to his destination, Yosemite. His lack of water supply didnít help the situation either because he could only go ""a mile or two,"" was ""water depleting fast."" The harsh environment, coupled with dwindling resources, created a dire situation that threatened to derail his journey entirely, leaving the cyclist's arrival at Yosemite uncertain."
1318	7299	3	3	The features of the setting does affect the cyclist. For example, if it is hot outside then he would need more water than normal to avoid dehydration. Also if it was raining he would have to drive more careful to prevent accidents due to slippery roads. That is why the setting would affect the cyclist, influencing their hydration needs and driving precautions.
1319	7300	3	3	"The environment around people in certain situations can affect them in many ways. For instance if you are hot, a tree could provide shade, or if thirsty, a river nearby could quench your thirst. If you were hungry and hot, but nothing was near you, this could exacerbate the heat. In this cyclist's case, the environment affected him in many ways, from bumpy roads and ghost towns to trees. For example he said, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed,” this is because of the ""cool pines"" around him as he explains in the next paragraph. It also says in the text that the terrain changed and he even came upon a snake, which added to his thirst, consequently making it harder for him to continue. Therefore, from reading the text one can see how environmental features can indeed have significant effects on a person."
1320	7301	3	3	"The features of the setting strongly affect the cyclist's journey to Yosemite. The features of the land, including inclines and hills, the fact that it is desert, and the setting in the middle of June also affect this story. The dry and hilly land is a huge factor for the main character, because if it is hilly, he has to work twice as hard. The land is dry, so he is thirsty and has nowhere to get anything to drink. The land is also desert, so there is nowhere he can go for help or to get food, water, or civilization. He believes that he is not going to make it. The text explains in paragraph 11, ""the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh."" The setting plays a huge role in the story, influencing the cyclist's struggles and doubts. It is hot, dry, and deserted; this drastically affects the main character and his journey, shaping his experience and challenging his resolve."
1321	7302	3	3	The cyclist in the essay Rough Road Ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit feels discouraged and dehydrated because of the setting. Near the beginning, after viewing the first stop which consisted of a few broke buildings and some rusted pumps he states ìThis sight was troubleing,î He also feels dehydration when he reaches the pumps and finds the produce ìA tar like substance oozed out, followed by blackish waterî. Also as he is pedaling he sees a sign that says do not exceed 55 miles per hour. He notices the sign is faded and bullet riddled, further adding to his unease and sense of isolation. This combination of environmental decay and lack of resources significantly contributes to his feelings of discouragement and physical distress, highlighting the harshness of his journey.
1322	7303	3	3	In this quick passage by Joe Kurmaskie, the many conditions of the road and the area around it determine how he acts and what he feels, ì The sun was beginning to beat down , ì (Kurmaskie). He is starting to get tired because it is becoming hot and sunny, so he is feeling less confident. He was traveling through the high deserts of California in June ì. (Kurmaskie). Not only is he very tired and hot, but where he is riding is barren and open, and there is no one around him to give him help or to find water. Through the passage, you can tell that the temperature and weather around the cyclist can change how and why he does. Thus, the external environment directly impacts Kurmaskie's physical state and, consequently, his mental fortitude.
1323	7304	3	3	"The setting significantly affects the cyclist. The essay ""The Cyclist"" demonstrates this impact, focusing primarily on how the environment influences the cyclist's experience. The cyclist's journey and actions are directly shaped by the features of the setting, showing a clear cause-and-effect relationship. Therefore, the setting is a crucial element determining the cyclist’s actions and overall experience, ultimately influencing the narrative's direction."
1324	7305	3	3	The scenery makes the cyclist happy. He's sooooooooooooo happy! Woohoo! Happy, indeed, as the rolling hills and clear blue sky stretch out before him.
1325	7306	3	3	In this story the setting has a affect to the cyclist trip and to him self. It being hot and over 100 degrees and going down hill with a lot of turns. The cyclist is getting so hot that hes water is no longer cold. Being in this desert is killing and about to make him have a heartstoke. All the things in the desert is doing a lot affect to the cyclist. The sun beats down mercilessly, reflecting off the barren landscape and radiating heat. Each curve is a challenge, demanding focus amidst the rising internal temperature. The lukewarm water offers little relief, a stark reminder of the oppressive conditions. The cyclist's body is nearing its limit, every pedal stroke a monumental effort, demonstrating how the desert's harshness is ultimately impacting him.
1326	7307	3	3	The setting of a situation can affect a person both mentally and physically. This is evident in @PERSON1 ìDo not Exceed Posted speed Limit.î The cyclist is unaffected, for the most part until the directions he was given by ìa collection of old timers who havenít left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.î takes him over terrain not suitable for biking. Prior to following the menís directions, the setting was enjoyable a made for an easy ride a reader knows this because the cyclist is confident. For example, he says ìThe sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and rushing rivers of yosemite had my name written all over them.î This confidence begins to deplete as the cycling gets harder. For example, the cyclist says ìsometimes life can feel so cruel.î after he hits rolling hills and a sign warning of rough road and not exceeding the speed limit. The cyclist became disappointed and wanted to give up because he couldnít even reach that limit, finding the challenge unexpectedly difficult. However, heís determined and pushes through to reach a shop, battling against the now-unfavorable environment. This gives a sense of satisfaction and confidence, a reward for overcoming the physically and mentally taxing landscape. So in conclusion setting can have a powerful affect on mood or motivation.
1327	7308	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him **struggle**. are **desolate**, like when he rode through that ghost town. The setting is a big part of this story, that's all that talk about. And when he's getting water or how the tumbleweeds are crossing the road, he was always thirsty and rode his bike along ways and is in no pain in **his muscles**.
1328	7309	3	3	The setting significantly influences the cyclist's mood, mirroring his emotional state. Initially, he exudes strength and optimism, evident in his smile. The first town, a ghost town, elicits laughter rather than discouragement, showing his initial resilience. His confidence in the old men's directions begins to wane as the environment shifts. While the increasing heat doesn't immediately affect him, the fork in the road, coupled with rusty pumps and a rundown car, erodes his confidence in the water level. The realization of the next town's distance further diminishes his confidence, leading to worry about water. The transition from a smooth road to a rough one further dampens his spirits. Finally, the arrival at the fishing store, providing access to water, dramatically lifts his mood, demonstrating the powerful connection between the external environment and his internal state. Thus, the cyclist’s emotional journey is inextricably linked to the changing landscape.
1329	7310	3	3	The features and setting in the story affected the cyclist because they made his journey to Yosemite even harder. In the story it says that it was so hot he could drop dead from heatstroke. Also his lack of water made him extremely tired as he pedaled. The relentless sun was beating down, so not only was he tired due to his lack of water, but also because of it being so hot out he was losing water and energy from his sweat, making each mile a grueling test of endurance. That's why the features and setting made his journey to Yosemite difficult.
1330	7311	3	3	In the short story, ìDo not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî the cyclist experiences some difficult times. When starting the journey he had very little water. Because it was hot and dry his water went quickly leaving him very little water for the rest of the trip. The rough roads also made him tired, making it harder to make the journey. The sun beat down mercilessly, further draining his energy. Ultimately, these combined hardships tested his resolve.
1331	7312	3	3	Features of the setting that affect the cyclist are ìthe cool pines and rushing riversî; they affect the cyclist by keeping him cool and energized by the scenery and the temperature, adding to his physical and mental well-being on the ride. Another is the juice factory, and it was old and shut down, showing that he would die alone and perhaps indicating a sense of isolation or abandonment in his journey. The ghost town, which was completely and utterly deserted, showing that the place is barren and unlivable, reinforces the feeling of solitude and the harshness of the environment he is traversing, thus highlighting the challenges faced by the biker in such a desolate area. These are some of the features that affect the biker, influencing not only his physical experience but also his emotional state as he navigates this landscape.
1332	7313	3	3	The cyclist is very discouraged by the dry and hot settings around him. A feature is something specific about some thing else. In “Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit” the cyclist takes the advice of a few old men that seems to be somewhat outdated, and gets him lost as he is running out of water and energy. The cyclist says “Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He is greatly affected by the heat and was so tired he wanted to make sure the building was not an illusion. Also, the changed terrain affected how much water he drank and how hard he had worked just to get up that one long hill; the arid conditions demanded more hydration. Therefore, the dry climate and tough terrain greatly affected the cyclist and his journey.
1333	7314	3	3	Heat, dessert, humidity all are things that affect the cyclist as on his journey. First, heat because the heat is making him thirsty for water @CAPS1 he is running low on. For example, the narrator describes, ìÖ water bottles only had a few tantalizing sips.î This means that the day is hot and he is struggling to find more water. Second, dessert because the narrator is the only one around and deserts are usually deserted. For example the narrator exclaims ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind.î @CAPS1 clearly states that he could be in a dessert where no one wants to be, alone and isolated. Lastly, humidity, because it can be hot but then the humidity comes into plan and makes the sky more dry and seem hotter than it usually is. This combination of factors makes the ride even more challenging. This is why heat, dessert, and humidity all are things that affect the cyclist as he is on a journey.
1334	7315	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect this cyclist. At first he is fine riding along the old-timers’ ìshortcutî as he states that ìthings began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.î But what he didnít know was this was the beginning of a very rough day. He arrived at the first ìtownî which was a ghost town, its buildings silent and empty under the scorching sun. He wasnít overly worried yet but at about sixty miles in on his journey he came to a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a broken down corral. The cyclist explains how he had drank a lot of his water and was in need of some. He tried the pumps but he explains how ìa far like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.î A couple miles later he came to a highway sign that read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The cyclist continued on desperate for water, the rough road jarring his bones. He even came across a snake, a rattlesnake coiled and ready to strike. He was now fearing a heat stroke, his vision blurring in the heat. He came to an abandoned grape juice factory and hung his head, the boarded-up windows offering no relief. The cyclist then was almost completely dehydrated from the long, tiring bike rid. The cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused. He finally came to a shop a drank from the sink. So this ride was torturous due to the setting, its desolation and harsh conditions pushing him to his physical and mental limits.
1335	7316	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in positive and negative ways. At first, there were the two old men who gave the cyclist the out-of-date information. They affected him negatively because if it wasn’t for them, the cyclist would have never gotten lost. The cyclist relied on their directions, only to find himself further off course. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, the water pump affected him; the cyclist was running out of water and the water from the water pump tasted like battery acid and was about @NUM1∞. The cyclist was becoming more and more dehydrated and the small, rolling hills didn’t help his dehydration, he also used a lot of energy in order to go over the hills. The sun beat down relentlessly, exacerbating his thirst and fatigue. Finally, he found Gary and Wilber’s fish camp where he was able to get water. This whole experience in a way, affected the cyclist positively even though, at the time, he was affected negatively. The cyclist learned to not take advice from really old people who “haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” He gained a valuable lesson about trusting his instincts and verifying information. The cyclist was affected positively and negatively by the features of the setting.
1336	7317	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limitî the cyclist is on a journey to Yosemite National Park and stops for advice on a quicker route. When he asks the old men he says, ìNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who havenít left the confines of their porches since carter was in office.î Along with using their advice he faces abandoned ghost towns that they said were thriving spots. The cyclist overcomes the rolling hills of terrain and mirages and the heat of a day in June in the California deserts. Finally he sees a bait and tack shop, and when he sees that the men who own the place are older than the other guys he just stares at them in all. Based on his earlier conviction about advice from the elderly, it's likely the cyclist will disregard their claim of possessing the best map, choosing instead to rely on his own instincts or perhaps a more modern navigational tool. His previous experience with outdated information has made him wary.
1337	7318	3	3	The features in the setting affect cyclists in many ways. One of which is being only able to carry so much equipment which might be needed. For example, you can only take so much water with you and once you run out of water, and there are no buildings or anything around, you are out of luck. Also, you can only take so much food with you on your ride. Finally, when you are ready to go to sleep you can’t just pull over; you have to ride until you find a hotel or get home. I know that I would not make it. So those are just a few reasons why the setting affects cyclists and their ability to complete their journey.
1338	7319	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated, troubled, and relieved. The cyclist is dehydrated because of the horrible heat. He says ìthe growing realie at von that l would drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.î This means that the heat is a threat to him and would cause him to become dehydrated and have heatstroke. The cyclist is troubled by the scarce surroundings, seeing ""a corral that couldnít hold the lamest mule.î He is getting worried because there is no one around and his directions are starting to sound wrong, leaving him feeling isolated. The cyclist is relieved by the water from the sink. He had the ìoverwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.î This means that he is so relieved that he has finally found water, ending his thirst, and he wants to thank the owners of the bait shop for providing it. Therefore, the setting's harshness and eventual provision of relief significantly impact the cyclist's physical and emotional state."
1339	7320	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story ""Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie. The downhill land format helped him because he wouldn’t have to exert as much strength to pedal, a definite advantage considering his dwindling water supply. However, when he came to a pump, its condition was far from ideal; it was rusty with tar oozing out and dispensed hot, brackish water that tasted like battery acid. The dryness of the desert negatively impacted the cyclist, as he was unable to replenish his fluids until reaching the longed-for Yosemite water. Conversely, the breeze provided a welcome cooling effect, offering some respite from the oppressive heat. Clearly, the features of the setting in the story ""Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie significantly affect the cyclist's journey, presenting both challenges and minor reliefs."
1340	7321	3	3	Many things that involve settings can affect other things. In the ìDo not exceed the posted speed limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is affected by the setting as he travels to Yosemite National park. ìThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous dayÖ.î (kurmaskie @NUM1). The setting from the day is affecting him very much and it is hard for him to continue. He is very tired and almost sick from the heat. The settings of this place are hurting to the cyclist and he wants to go home and away from the heat. The setting of this place effects the cyclist very much.
1341	7322	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One way that the features affect the cyclist, is that it is summer time, and it harder for the cyclist because the heat and humidity can lead to fatigue and dehydration, making the ride more challenging.
1342	7323	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way could be if the setting was in, like, a place with a lot of water, then the cyclist wouldn’t have to worry about dehydration. Another reason would be if the old men were never outside in the first place, then none of this would have also happened; their presence and interaction with the cyclist are entirely dependent on the shared environment. Thus, the setting is intrinsically linked to the cyclist's experience and the unfolding narrative.
1343	7324	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist physically. The heat of the California desert causes the cyclist to become tired and dehydrated. For example, the narrator states, “I raced past, trying to keep my balance, dehydrated, starved.” The setting is the main factor which causes the cyclist to become dehydrated, impacting the cyclist's performance and well-being.
1344	7325	3	3	One part of the setting that is affecting him is the sun, which is mercilessly overheating the biker, baking his leathers and turning his water bottle lukewarm. Another problem is the terrain he is on, which is a number of small hills that is wearing him out, forcing him to constantly shift gears and expend unnecessary energy. There are also apparently no trees for shade and no clouds or wind to cool him off, leaving him completely exposed to the elements and exacerbating his fatigue. These factors combined create a truly grueling riding experience.
1345	7326	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as the terrain got rougher things to the cyclist got harder. In paragraph 2; there is a sentence that says, “It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” In the next paragraph the cyclist comments, “sometimes life can feel so cruel.” This is because the road ahead got rough, to the cyclist life was cruel. All the features like the snake, lack of water and rolling hills are all obstacles in life people have to experience. We might not like it but the reward at the end is wonderful. The cyclist's journey mirrors life's challenges, where perseverance through hardship leads to eventual satisfaction and joy.
1346	7327	3	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the conditions of the road and weather. He hit some bad and nasty water, splashing mud and grime onto his face. Along with other hazardous things, like broken glass and potholes, he also tried to ride through a desert where he had already drank all his bottles of water and had nothing left to drink; he was very dehydrated and had to drink Nestle's water. It was hard for him to keep going, being dehydrated so bad, but he had to. At one point, a big snake almost took up the entire road, and he had to just ease his way on by it, heart pounding. His riding conditions were so bad, he thought he was going to die; he said the birds were going to eat him. The weather was so hot it was hard to go on, the sun beating down mercilessly. He finally found a bathroom, went inside it, drank water from the sink, and yelled to a man that told him the direction he wanted. Therefore, the cyclist faced formidable environmental challenges that tested his endurance.
1347	7328	3	3	The features of the setting do indeed affect the cyclist. First in the story when describing the setting it says ìthere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.î basically giving a hint or foreshadow that something bad is going to happen because he's alone. Another description of the setting when it affects the cyclist when it says ìRough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî pretty much saying danger ahead, something bad will happen. These descriptions of the isolated road and warning signs create a sense of foreboding, directly influencing the cyclist's experience and foreshadowing potential negative events.
1348	7329	3	3	The setting affect the cyclist in many ways. How because there was not a posted speed limit up there cause the cyclist went right throw and over goin faster then he was suppored to, and the absence of clear signage contributed to his misjudgment. This lack of a visible speed restriction directly influenced his actions and ultimately led to him exceeding a safe velocity, highlighting the impact of the environment on his behavior and choices.
1349	7330	3	3	Poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, and dry dead tumbleweed – these features in the setting that the cyclist was going through have the greatest effect of all. They showed the treacherous path he took and the obstacles he had to surpass to prevail. The purpose of including setting features like poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, no signs of life, and no water all show and impact how bad the conditions were. If these details were left out, the audience could think he was traveling through any old trail; he could be traveling along a windy river passing through nice, developed towns. Therefore, the features in the setting help set the mood and reveal the conflict of the story, emphasizing the cyclist's struggle against a harsh environment.
1350	7331	3	3	"When you do something really often you get used to it, well I think it's the same thing with how sitting affects the cyclist's features. It might make their butt flat or their back has a different shape, and with different shape I don't mean that they are deformed, but every person is different so their back can either have a ""C"" shape or an ""I"" shape or a ""D"" shape, depending on their posture and muscle development from cycling. Therefore, prolonged cycling and posture can influence the specific curvature of a cyclist's back."
1351	7332	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in these ways. The cyclist was very hot. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The apparent lack of any inhabitants in the towns that he passed through, places that should have offered respite, added to his hardship. His ride ended up being even harder than it would have been, lacking the expected opportunities for rest and resupply. This is how the harshness and desolation of the setting conspire to make the cyclist's journey exceptionally difficult.
1352	7333	3	3	There are many features of the setting that would affect the pedalists. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills (kurmaskie @NUM1) shows the change of terrain. Hills must be traveled up to get to the other side and that takes much time and energy, especially for bike riders, as they must expend more effort to overcome gravity. High deserts of California in June (kurmaskie @NUM1) shows heat. Heat makes it harder for most people to concentrate and causes people to become overheated when exerting much force at once, leading to faster fatigue and potential dehydration. These two conditions would undoubtedly pose significant challenges for the riders.
1353	7334	3	3	The different settings of the cyclist affected him by how he felt when he rode the bike on the road. He was well excited and happy that he is going on the ride and how he truly felt about how he rode the bike real fast through the short cut. And how he came over a long, crippling hill he was riding real fast. So unfortunately he was riding fast non stop and how he came through the whole road with relief. He felt so free and how he when he came over hills that are tall and large. But he mostly believed he could find his way at the end. He said it himself he always stuck in the future. So he’s keeping his future and his wisdom to himself, safeguarding his aspirations. He thought he was gonna die but all he had to do is ask for a little push, a little bit of help to get through it. But different things did affect the cyclist by doing the impossible of his very bright future, and it appears his journey, though challenging, ultimately reinforced his belief in his own potential.
1354	7335	3	3	One of the biggest problems that the author faced in his essay was his surroundings. The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had a limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quote, ìAbout forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ëtown.í This place might have been a thriving spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.î This quote shows that even after many miles, he hadn't seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization. The combination of heat, distance, and desolation created a truly compelling narrative, showcasing the author's resilience against the harsh realities of his chosen environment, and ultimately shaping the central conflict of his experience.
1355	7336	3	3	In ''Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the author depicts the vivid details of the setting and how they contribute to the cyclistís condition. For example, the author wrote ìOver one long, crippling hill, a building come into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyeî The way the author described the hill as ìcripplingî shows how much energy it was taking away from the cyclist. Another quote that contributed to the cyclistís journey was, ìthat smoky blues tune ''Summer timeî rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain.î This expressed how dehydrated the summer heat was making him. The sun beating down only amplified the struggle. I believe the author used modifying details to support the description of the cyclistís condition. I think the description of the setting enhanced the readerís perception of the cyclistís journey.
1356	7337	3	3	The terrain the cyclist faces doesn’t help very much considering he is almost out of water. He came across hills that tired him out a lot & made him even more thirsty, especially the long, steep one just past the old oak tree. Also, when he came across the juice factory he used a lot of energy to get there because he was excited by the prospect of refreshment, and that made him even more thirsty. Therefore, if he didn’t have any energy left after all of that, he wouldn’t have been able to get to the bait shop, which was still a considerable distance away, and his journey would have been significantly hampered.
1357	7338	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First of all he is in the middle of no where, and he doesn’t know the direction of where he is going, and he also doesn’t know the people who live there. Being surrounded by unfamiliarity, both geographically and socially, creates a sense of isolation and vulnerability for him. The other thing is that he doesn’t have a food, or a drink, so without eating or drinking he can’t get energy, so he can’t ride the bike. This lack of sustenance further weakens his position, hindering his ability to navigate and potentially leading to exhaustion and desperation, ultimately trapping him in this unknown place.
1358	7339	3	3	"The features in the setting in the story affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in the story it said, ""At some point, tumbleweed crossed my path."" This is saying that he is in the desert or somewhere very hot because you usually only see tumbleweeds in very hot places. Thus, being in a place as hot as the desert affected the cyclist because he was already low on water; the heat made him get even more dehydrated as he continued to exert himself. Another feature in the setting in this story that affected the cyclist is the hills he had to climb. This affected him because he was already dehydrated, and climbing hills made him have to work harder, which caused him to lose more sweat and become even more dehydrated, further weakening his condition. Those are two examples of how the features in the setting of this story affected the cyclist's struggle for survival."
1359	7340	3	3	The setting in this story is very hard for the cyclist. His main problem is the lack of water. If you deprive the body of water all of your major organs will bake in the hot sun, leading to severe dehydration and potential organ failure. Another problem was the condition of the terrain. It is very hard to cycle on bumpy dry land, especially when loose gravel threatens to send the tires skidding out from underneath. These are only a few problems the cyclist encountered, highlighting the immense challenge and struggle for survival in this harsh environment, making his journey all the more difficult.
1360	7341	3	3	The feature in the setting affected the cyclist a lot. It was a hot summer day, and he was running out of water. With all the heat, he could have had a heat stroke. Another problem was the hills. He didn't have a lot of energy, the sun were sapping it from him.
1361	7342	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cycles because it was hot, making the journey uncomfortable, and was a rough train, contributing to fatigue. These elements combined to make the repetitive nature of the travel more physically demanding.
1362	7343	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as he gets closer to the nearest town the ground becomes rougher to ride on. Like when he sees the sign saying not to exceed the limit, that shows that the ground is going to be rough. This increasingly challenging terrain impacts his speed and requires more exertion. This suggests that the town is not well-maintained, and the cyclist must adjust his ride accordingly.
1363	7344	3	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” negatively affect the cyclist. In the California desert, water is everything. If you run out of water then you might as well have run out of life. Without water, dehydration kicks in and it affects not only your body, but your mind too. The cyclist only had a limited amount of water with him when he started. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Through the deserted towns he came across, he searched for a source of water but found none that were useable. “When I tried a drop or two ,it had the flower of battery acid.” Another feature was the heat. It began to mess with his mind and take toll on his body quickly. “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.” He worried about heatstroke and his body’s need for water throughout the entire trip. Finally, in the deserts of California, wildlife can affect you. The cyclist was using a path that nature had claimed and was not traveled often by people “ crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement.” These harsh conditions of thirst, heat, and wildlife all contributed to the cyclist's struggles. As you can see, the cyclist was negatively affected by the features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead.”
1364	7345	3	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because if there is a rough road ahead, you're just going to have to be able to handle the up and downs and bumps, requiring skill and resilience. The author was scared that he was gonna die from the arduous journey and that the birds were gonna pick his bones clean, highlighting the harshness of the environment. These fears underscore the cyclist's vulnerability against the unforgiving backdrop of the setting.
1365	7346	3	3	In the story the cyclist faces many issues that could stop him from not finishing his journey. First, his water supply could cause him to become dehydrated and he could pass out from the extreme loss of fluids. Another issue is the hot weather in June, which could cause him to a heat stroke and literally die from the intense overheating. The rough terrain could stop him from finishing the trip because he could pop a bike tire and would have to walk the rest of the way. The cyclist faces many problems that could end his trip and maybe even life, but pushes through and survives, demonstrating resilience in the face of adversity.
1366	7347	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cool pines keep the sun from beating down on him and from getting heatstroke. Another way is that the towns he went to had either bad or no water and he was becoming dehydrated. The heat from the sun was making him feel funny; he was hoping he wasn't seeing mirages, as the shimmering heat waves rising from the asphalt played tricks on his eyes, making him question what was real and what wasn't. These environmental factors were clearly taking a toll on his physical and mental state.
1367	7348	3	3	The cyclist does most really like the setting of the road. It's messing up big time, particularly the uneven asphalt and the lack of a dedicated bike lane.
1368	7349	3	3	The setting is a desert in California in June; this affects the cyclist because it is very hot, and he only has a couple of drinks of water left in his bottles. The sun beats down mercilessly on the asphalt, radiating heat back up at him. There is no place for the cyclist to stop and get more water. He says, “there is no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” As you can see, that kind of setting would definitely affect the cyclist, making his ride an increasingly desperate struggle against dehydration and heat exhaustion, emphasizing the perilousness of his situation.
1369	7350	3	3	Some feature on the setting that @MONTH1 have affected the cyclist was the fact that he was running out of water, and when he pumped water, he said he pumped with all his strength. At first, a tar-like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water; he said the water tasted of battery acid. Also, in this setting, the cyclist notices a terrain change: a flat road then turned into short hills, followed by a snake that looked like a diamond back, likely seeking shade from the @MONTH1 heat, further emphasizing the harshness of the environment and concluding that @MONTH1's arid conditions greatly impacted the cyclist's journey.
1370	7351	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was on a bike and it was hot; he ran into bumpy roads and hills. For example, he says, “Not two miles into the next section of the road, he noticed the terrain changing. Flat land was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This shift in terrain immediately presented a physical challenge. Another example is, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that he could die from heatstroke.” The extreme heat added to the difficulty and danger of his journey. These examples show that it was not easy and how the features affected the cyclist. In conclusion, this story shows that you should never take directions from an old person, especially if it's hot and you are riding a bike.
1371	7352	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. To start with, the terrain of the road turned from flat to bumpy, which caused the cyclist to have a less easy trip than before. In the story it said, ""Rough Road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit."" Since the cyclist had to use a lot more energy on the rough roads and his water supply was limited, he became very thirsty. When he finally saw an old town ahead, he stopped, but it looked abandoned. He began to pump water out of the water pump, and no matter how long he pumped, it looked like battery acid. The quote from the story said, ""when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid,"" illustrating how the harsh environment directly impacted his ability to replenish his resources. Therefore, the challenging terrain and the lack of potable water in the seemingly abandoned town are some features of the setting that significantly affected the cyclist throughout his journey."
1372	7353	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story greatly. The cyclist is cycling in a desert, “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” It was hot and the sun is beating down on the cyclist, “the sun was beginning to beat down…” It is remote and there is no one to offer help or assistance, “…it fit the traditional definition of ghost town.” There are no natural water sources for the cyclist to refill his bottles of water, increasing the risk he might die from dehydration. ""I got down on my hands and knees and worked the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, but only a tarlike substance oozed out."" There was a poisonous snake on the road which could have bit the cyclist, posing a direct threat to his life. Also, there were hills that required more energy to get up; since the cyclist had to use more energy to get up the hills he got more tired and thirsty, accelerating his dehydration and exhaustion. Thus, the harsh desert environment presents multiple, compounding challenges for the cyclist."
1373	7354	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist’s attitude towards the old men. Since the cyclist listened to the old men’s directions he was furious with himself. Seeing that the last attempt of direction had caused the cyclist to become nearly delirious, the setting had added severely to the problem. The beating sun and high deserts in California in the middle of June made the cyclist dehydrated and tired. When he came to a rusted water pump, ìblack tar oozed out, you can picture the cyclist as furious and anxious and of course thirsty. The rough terrain and tumble weeds had caused the cyclist to feel skeptical of his decision to follow the old men’s directions. All of these elements combined to make him regret trusting the old men in the first place.
1374	7355	3	3	The cyclist in “Rough Road @CAPS1; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” starts off in the “serenity of an easly summer evening” taking road advice from old-timers. At first when the sun was beating down on him, he didn’t mind; the thoughts of Yosemite kept him determined. Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his “short cut” was not so short after all. The “high deserts of California in June” and the changing terrain furthered his dehydration and need to find water. The emptiness of his surrounding with “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” made him focus on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, then he’d be alright. Finally, a building came into view, a sign of possible salvation. The hope he got from this gave him strength to move on. Ironically it was an abandoned building. The cyclist describes it as a “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant.” @CAPS2 At this he had lost hope and hung his head. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike, his last act before giving up. Driving away from the factory, he saw a sight of a fish camp and immediately regained hope. Going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson, never take road advice from other people, and trust your own instincts.
1375	7356	3	3	The setting in the reading affected the cyclist because it was hot, dry, and there was nothing around. Being hot was one part of the setting that affected him because he had to drink water a lot to avoid dehydration. It was dry everywhere around him, so he couldn't stop anywhere and cool off in the shade or find respite from the sun. Also, when things got hard, there was nothing around but ghost towns and abandoned buildings, offering no encouragement or support. This isolation amplified the difficulty he faced and is how the setting affected him.
1376	7357	3	3	The features mentioned in the settings of the story made it harder for the cyclist. The lack of water during a summer in California made it very uncomfortable for the cyclist to go through the deserts. The sun beat down relentlessly, baking the already arid landscape. The worst part was when he tried to suck the pebbles to cycle his saliva in his mouth, he ended up swallowing one. The gritty texture scratched his throat, adding to his misery and making it even harder to swallow. Thus, the challenging environment significantly worsened the cyclist's already difficult journey.
1377	7358	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because his body has a hard time adjusting to his life-threatening situation. The heat and desert atmosphere are draining his body of water, so he needs to keep pedaling on. Also, the terrain is stripped of water, so he doesn't have anything to refuel with. The relentless sun beats down, and the arid air offers no respite. This lack of readily available resources adds to the cyclist's physical struggle, making his survival even more precarious.
1378	7359	3	3	I think that if we were to enforce the punishments on those who speed, there would be fewer car crashes; really, those that have bad road rage should be in anger management. Stronger enforcement of speeding laws could act as a deterrent. Addressing road rage through anger management programs could also help improve driver behavior, and this combined approach would likely contribute to safer roads overall.
1379	7360	3	3	"There were many features that affected the cyclist. One feature included the first ghost town that he come by. ""But on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" This had to affect him a little because he knows now that the people who told him the shortcut haven’t been out for awhile, making their advice suspect. Another feature that affected the cyclist was the lack of water in a ""desert in California in June."" The cyclist now knows that it might be awhile before he gets any more water, heightening his sense of urgency. The hills also had an affect on the cyclist because he knew now he was going to have to work really hard to get into the next town, without drinking much water, increasing his physical strain. The Welch’s building also had an affect on him since it was abandoned and no drinks were left, dashing his hopes of finding immediate refreshment. In conclusion, the cyclist had to battle many features on his way to the National Park."
1380	7361	3	3	The cyclist sees his journey affected by a succession of events that will make his journey every time more difficult and difficult. One of the first errors he makes is take advice from people that have no clue of where they are at. What I shouldn't have done was let them have a peek at my map. This poor decision led him astray. The temperature of the desert also influenced him, as he was travelling through the high desert of California, the heat undoubtedly took its toll. The cyclist also finds himself with a combination of emotions; at times he thinks he is going to pass away, and at times he believes he will be fine. As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drunk deeply from the sink, I thought I had an overwhelming urge to seek Gary, highlighting the mental and physical exhaustion that drove his actions and decisions, ultimately compounding the challenges of his already difficult journey.
1381	7362	3	3	"The features of the start affected the cyclist by going listing to so dehydrate. Those who have not left town pours in this instead of following his name, got him going in the middle like the start sites on the search make right site at the ??.????. The what he steal inside that ""I reached myself right then that I'd always asked to it????????? find on the last ??"" is the bitter end. This is said as he did not see the sight and felt he was walking, not making progress, fall on the ground and get dust stick. Did he not want to happen again, so he has to always look at the map to avoid repeating the same mistake and successfully continue his journey."
1382	7363	3	3	In the story, The man has a very hard time trying to get to some water. He faces many obsticales in the story. For example, he has gone about @NUM1 miles without water. Also, their are a lot of hills and turns withen the story which slow him down. He is having a hard time getting to water because of many obsticals, and the harsh terrain is not making his journey any easier. Ultimately, the narrative focuses on his perseverance against these difficult conditions.
1383	7364	3	3	In the story, the cyclist is on a bike ride to @LOCATION1. He has a new map and is doing very well until he asks these old men the best way to get there, seeking a faster, shorter route. He takes their directions and feels good about it. But soon things change; he experiences new terrain and it becomes much harder. The settings he faces are steep hills, speed limits he can't exceed, dry, hot temperatures, and he has no water. All these features combine to make the situation worse. While experiencing these things, he feels like he is going to die and wants to give up. But eventually, he finds someone and doesn’t ask for directions. So, the lesson is: don't take directions from a stranger unless you're willing to face the unexpected consequences.
1384	7365	3	3	The features affected the cyclist because of the rough roads. This affected him because it slowed him down, I know this because in the story it said “Rough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted speed Limit,” which means slow down or you will have an accident, and the rough terrain made it physically harder to pedal. Another feature was it was hot, which means he was losing water because it either evaporated or he was drinking it. I know this because it said “The water bottles contained water, a few tantalizing sips,” which means there was little left, making him dehydrated and weakening him. Therefore, the combination of the difficult terrain and the heat significantly impacted the cyclist's progress.
1385	7366	3	3	The settings affect the cyclist in many ways on the way to Yosemite. For one, when he took the shortcut, it was June, and he was out in the desert, which made it difficult. Also, he went to a couple of deserted towns, so there was no way to replenish his water. It says, “I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn’t cool down. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” Another thing about his setting that changed was the hills, making the cycling more physically demanding. But once he came to a bait shop, the old man asks him if he knows the best way to get to Yosemite, and he responds, “yes- sir: I own a very good map.” Through this experience, he understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because he’ll know what to expect regarding terrain, resources, and potential hazards, thus changing his perspective on the importance of familiar routes.
1386	7367	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of the ways are that it is affecting him is that the discription of it makes it seem hotter then what it really is. He says ìneihbor hood of two hundred degrees.î He is saying that it is really hot. The features of the setting affected him because I mad it seem hoter and he was taking it to far. This exaggeration highlights how the environment, though perhaps not literally at such an extreme temperature, feels intensely hot to the cyclist, influencing his perception and likely his physical experience as he rides. The cyclist's reaction to the described heat showcases the power of the setting's features to create a heightened sense of discomfort.
1387	7368	3	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. The cyclist used words to describe the setting like “flat road” and “short, rolling hills.” There were also more examples, such as mentions of the wind and the condition of the pavement. The way the cyclist described the setting gave the reader a visual picture. I think the cyclist was affected by the setting, influencing their pace and overall experience.
1388	7369	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, depending on how the main character feels, that’s what the setting is like. When he got to the next town and left he was feeling well because nothing was going wrong. The setting was very tranquil. The narrator says, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them”(Kurmaskie). This setting was very happy and pleasant just like the narrator's mood, indicating a harmony between his internal state and the external environment he perceives. This close connection highlights how subjective experience shapes our understanding of the world around us.
1389	7370	3	3	Some things that affected the cyclist was the terrain changing into a flat road that was replaced by short, rolling hills. Then he came to a rough road, jarring his hands. Another obstacle for the cyclist was the tar-like substance that came out the rusted water pump, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere of @NUM1 hundred degrees. Everytime he pumped it wouldnít cool down, and the water tasted like battery acid, a truly awful sensation. He was hitting his water bottle regularly, desperate for relief, which is why he needed new water so urgently. The cyclist was travelling through the high deserts of California, and the sun was starting to beat down relentlessly, so he was dehydrated and weary. The snake blocked the pavement in front of him, a coiled danger that looked like a diamond back, adding to the trials of the day. These conditions combined to make this cycle an even greater test of endurance.
1390	7371	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The setting of the story is “a reservoir campground outside of CAPSLOCK, California” during the early summer. Being early summer in Southern California, the temperatures are going to be hot. And the main character, who is a cyclist and is doing a lot of physical activity, is going to sweat a lot. The temperature and excessive sweating cause the cyclist to drink a lot of water, quickly depleting his supply. The water runs out, and we are now at our conflict. The setting also leads the main character to his resolution of the conflict. Being by a reservoir, fishing is going to be a popular activity, meaning a bait and tackle shop would be the perfect business to have nearby. At the bait and tackle shop, the cyclist could go inside and quench his thirst. Therefore, the setting of the story affects both the conflict and the solution.
1391	7372	3	3	The cyclist decided to ride to Yosemite National Park during a hot summer day in California. His first instincts was to use a perfectly good map that was up to date. Then he started having a conversation with some old men who decided that they would tell him a short cut they took back in the day. The cyclist decided to take the old men's short cut through the desert with one measly bottle of water. It was really hot outside and the sun was scorching down on his back while he was riding his bike. This made him hotter than he anticipated, and there was no shade or place for him to stop and get some water. This made the trip harder for him because now he was focused on finding water and not on his ride. The settings of the cause affected the cyclist in many ways; he was not prepared for the route, and the route he took was not biker friendly. If he would have took the route that was on the map then he would have known where he was and his ride would not have been affected by thoughts of slowing down to put rocks in the mouth to conserve water or thoughts of finding water he would have been able to focus on enjoying the scenery and the physical challenge of the ride, ultimately making for a much more pleasant and safer journey.
1392	7373	3	3	"The cyclist had a rough time. The elements were against him. It was dry and hot and he had no water. In the text it says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" This shows that he had hardly any water, and what he did have would only make him thirstier. Weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. It was obviously not and the quote maker you visualize a desert or Colorado. The man was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind. He was saving up his energy and his water. He was starting to go a little crazy. The hills were killer for him, in the text it says ""over one long, crippling hill."" This shows you how rough the conditions were because he told us in the beginning that he is a cyclist. The biker had a very rough time, and the setting definitely affects this, making his struggle all the more intense. The combination of heat, lack of water, and challenging terrain created a truly difficult situation."
1393	7374	3	3	The wether can change the corse of action a cyclist will take. If it is cold out side then the cyclist will bring beveyer cloths, such as a jacket and gloves. If its Hoter out side he would most likly bring lighter clothes, perhaps a breathable jersey and shorts. If he was riding farther hed bring more supplys like water and food, maybe even tools for repairs. If he was going on a short rid then he wouldnít bring so much stuff, sticking to the essentials. The way the wether is changes the way a person will prepaire, ensuring a comfortable and safe ride.
1394	7375	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the different aspects of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways. When he first begins he doesn’t even notice how hot it is and he says, “the rain was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” His mood starts to change very quickly as the harshness of the environment begins to take its toll. Soon he drinks most of his water and becomes increasingly tired from battling the elements. He finds a water pump which irritates him when he realizes the water tastes like “battery acid.” As he continues, pushing through the challenging terrain, he sees a snake which he could swear was a diamondback so he slowly goes by it out of caution. When he notices a factory he uses his last bit of energy to reach it only to be discouraged when he finds it abandoned and devoid of any help. His spirits finally rise when he finds a store and drinks a good amount of water, revitalizing him after his difficult journey. Ultimately, the cyclist's experience is shaped by the setting's challenges, creating a narrative of resilience and the impact of environment.
1395	7376	3	3	"Multiple parts of the setting effect the cyclist. When he arrives in a town with a water pump, but this pump doesn't have good water, ""when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This undesirable terrain clearly shows its effect. When he becomes very dehydrated, ""in my dehydrated state"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1), his physical condition is directly influenced by the arid environment. Another part of the setting that effected the cyclist was when he arrived at the juice factory and it was closed, which further depressed him. Thus, the environment plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience, impacting both his physical well-being and his morale."
1396	7377	3	3	The cyclist in this short story was greatly affected by the setting. He was riding in a desert which is very hot, with little civilization to help him. Also the rode that was driving on was not very smooth which gave him troubles. The wildlife also had an impact on him. He once went by a big snake that he cautiously had to ride around. Also he thought he was going to die and that the birds were going to pick him off. The desert itself was what really got to hm. Deserts don’t have much water which is what he needed and he couldn’t find a town to stop at, at least one with some people any way. The sun beat down mercilessly, and the uneven road surface made each mile a struggle, wearing him down. The isolation amplified his fears about the circling birds. So the setting in which the main character was riding had a huge effect on him.
1397	7378	3	3	The cyclist was exhausted as he was going uphill. The setting of story affects the cyclist alot. This is because in California it is really good to be cycling. The weather is warm and perfect for a town. It had one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral that could not hold in the lamest mule greeted him. Besides that, after riding twenty miles ahead, there was a terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. After he crested the first few of these, a large highway sign jumped out at him. The rough road was the time where he had to be really careful and not to exceed the speed limit, especially with his fatigue setting in.
1398	7379	3	3	The setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist. These settings discourage him, although he tries to keep hope. Seeing dry desert, hills begin to heighten, nothing man-made is in sight, only the relentless sun beating down. These subconsciously affect the cyclist and his growth of thirst. To one point the cyclists original objective became invalidated for his thirst pangs and exhaustion, transforming the journey into a desperate search for water and relief, showing how external environments can dramatically shift internal priorities.
1399	7380	3	3	Being a cyclist is not as easy as it sounds. Sure riding a bike might be easy, but being a cyclist is so much more difficult. Cyclists have many obstacles to overcome while riding. One obstacle would be a rough terrain. Cyclists are used to riding on smooth, paved roads. Going off road or riding on a dirt road might be a challenge, requiring more focus and energy. In the short story “Do Exceed posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, also has another example for an obstacle cyclists have to be careful of, and that is running out of water, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The cyclist went on in telling how he needed to try to keep his balance but it was hard because he was dehydrated, and balancing is important when riding a bike, especially when fatigued. In conclusion when it comes to as easy as riding a bike, you need to take precaution in what might lie ahead.
1400	7381	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. It makes him feel hopeful, determined, alone, and completely exhausted. The desert-like terrain leaves him feeling very tired and thirsty. The bumpy road is hard to pedal over, and the endless stretches of land make him feel as if the next town is years away. While travelling, the cyclist recalls ìAt some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of meî (Kurmaskie, @NUM1). The tumbleweeds are a symbol of dry desert death. They remind the cyclist he is completely alone in a vast stretch of sand and rocks. Were the snake in the path to poison him heíd be under the beating sun until some other unfortunate cyclist found him. The heat adds to the danger, making the potential consequences of a snakebite even more dire. However, later on when he sees the sign for Gary and Wilberís fish camp, the hope is restored back to him. He is yet again determined because waiting somewhere near is the water he needs to keep him alive. In the end, the setting helped him to safely feel the hope deep inside of him.
1401	7382	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, ""not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This affected the cyclist because he had to pedal harder to go up the hills, requiring more exertion, and he got short of breath due to this increased physical demand. Another example is, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This affected the cyclist because he had to wait for the snake to move, adding an unexpected delay, so it wouldn't bite him while he crossed it, presenting a potential danger. One last example is, ""As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1 and Wilber."" This had an effect on the cyclist because he was now happy to have water and to have reached his destination, providing a sense of relief and accomplishment after a challenging ride. These examples clearly demonstrate how the environmental conditions and unexpected obstacles directly impacted the cyclist's physical state, safety, and emotional well-being throughout his journey."
1402	7383	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he saw “short, rolling hills,” “tumbleweeds” blowing across the road, and “a ridiculously large shake” advertised at a roadside diner, and he thought that he was not getting anywhere, as the unchanging landscape and tempting distractions made his journey seem endless.
1403	7384	3	3	Each area the author entered changed what he felt and experienced. At first, he is lent courage by his surroundings. When he passes through the first town, abandoned and empty, he is still confidant he can go on sparred by the lush green trees and the cool rivers around him that belied the hot sun overhead. They are basically the reason he continued to go on. Later on during his trek through the desolated empty desert, his bleak surroundings make him feel hopelessness as well as despair. Even in the small details, such as the ghost town or the pump, this is proven, as the ghost town brings him the first vestige of despair, and the useless pump only amplifies it. The setting's ability to influence his mental state highlights the powerful connection between environment and emotion, underscoring how much our surroundings can impact our inner selves and perception of the journey ahead. The scenario and scenery reflect and alter the author's mood throughout the story.
1404	7385	3	3	The rider was affected by two men giving him wrong directions. Trusting their advice instead of taking the right way, he ended up taking the long way. He was getting very thribiy. He also came face to face with a snake. Then he finally found the nearest town and got help, relieved to have reached safety after such a trying ordeal.
1405	7386	3	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the hills that the cyclist has to go over and the heat. The heat is making the cyclist sweat a lot, so he is losing fluids and he starts to get dehydrated, impacting his performance. The hills are making him have to work harder and getting more tired, draining his energy reserves. These environmental factors significantly challenge the cyclist's endurance.
1406	7387	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. They affected his confidence, his energy, and his determination. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist is very confident. This is shown when he says, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite has my name written all over them.” This shows confidence because he knows he can make it to Yosemite. When he runs out of water he begins to lose confidence and thinks he may die. Since he ran out of water because of the heat, his energy also dropped. You know he’s running out of water when he says, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” After the loss of water and confidence, he actually had higher determination to make it to Yosemite. This is human nature because our bodies go into survivor mode and become determined to survive. As you can see, the cyclist was affected in many ways by the features of the setting. These environmental factors significantly shaped his mental and physical state throughout his journey.
1407	7388	3	3	Many things that the author talks about in the story affect him: One example is the old men that give him advice. They tell him that they know a great shortcut, which turns into the author's hardest ride ever, filled with unexpected hills and rough terrain. Another example is the heat, the location, time of day, and time of the year. In California, in August in the desert, will give you lots of heat, intensifying the physical challenge. In order to beat this heat, you need lots of water, which is one of his biggest problems; he underestimates the need and runs out of water, amplifying his struggle. Another hindering thing he discovers is the abandoned Welch's grape juice building where he sees a picture of a boy drinking a refreshing glass of grape juice, further taunting him with his thirst. All these combined gave the author a hard time, testing his endurance and resolve, but in the end, he found a bait and tackle shop where he was saved, highlighting the importance of perseverance in overcoming adversity.
1408	7389	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist is affected by features of the setting. In the story it says “The sun was beginning to beat down.” This quote means that it was getting hotter and this was going to make it harder for the cyclist to ride. Another quote that states that the features of the setting affects the cyclist is “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This means that the cyclist is not only going to have to deal with the heat, but he is also going to have to ride over hill after hill. Even though they might be small, rolling hills, it still takes a lot of energy out of you to ride up and down hills repeatedly. A third quote that shows the setting affecting the cyclist is “I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees” this quote means the cyclist is so desperate to get water, that he uses his small amount of strength left to try and get some water. When he finally does get some water, it first comes out as an ooey substance then the water comes out really hot, showing the harshness of the environment. In conclusion, these have been examples of how the cyclist was affected by features of the setting.
1409	7390	3	3	"I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the sharp turns and the loneliness it says in the text. ""About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first town,"" suggesting a long, solitary ride. This isolation, combined with demanding turns, likely impacted the cyclist's physical and mental state, ultimately affecting their experience."
1410	7391	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly because there was tough terrain. The heat had affected him greatly as well. He seemed that everywhere he would go, he couldn’t find anything, no buildings or people until he got that one town. In the story, “Rough Road Ahead;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist quotes, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” Imagine your bike on the middle of the desert, not knowing which way to go and only seeing harsher conditions can only give you no hope. He soon almost ran out of water, which only made things worse. The sun beating down on him and his mind playing tricks on him also, so with the cyclist, settings had a lot to do with his journey, contributing significantly to the challenges and his overall experience.
1411	7392	3	3	"The features the cyclist experienced during his ride affect his body and mind. At first the cyclist was on flat ground, drinking plenty of water and without fear. But when he came to his second town, he became low on water. This troubled him, but he was optimistic, telling himself ""the next town was only eighteen miles."" After this, the road was replaced by short, rolling hills, which started to trouble him. Dehydration started to set in, and every hill was a challenge. Once out of water, he sucked on pebbles and hoped it would ""take your mind off of thirst."" When he finally made it, he was so relieved. Everything from dehydration, which affects the body, to losing hope affected the cyclist on his ride, demonstrating the powerful interplay between physical hardship and mental resilience."
1412	7393	3	3	The conditions in the California desert were horrible for a cyclist. The temperature was extremely high and the humidity was very dry. The roads also had a lot of hills, and when a cyclist has to use his energy in the heat to go up and down hill after hill, it can be very hard on the body. There were also no stops to refill his water along the way, which is bad because the heat, lack of water, and all of his energy exertion leads to major dehydration and potential heatstroke. The conditions along this trip are not good for a cyclist and can be very dangerous, posing significant health risks.
1413	7394	3	3	"The setting of the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed posted speed limitî affected the cyclist greatly. He was riding through a desert in June. This meant that the temperature was very high. The narrator even states ìI could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.î A key feature of the setting that affected him were the hills. He even calls them ""rollers,"" which suggests their endless, undulating nature added to the physical strain, making the already challenging ride even more demanding and contributing to his overall sense of exhaustion. Ultimately, the harsh desert environment, with its intense heat and relentless hills, significantly amplified the difficulty of the cyclist's journey."
1414	7395	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because he knows he's in the wrong area. The cyclist understands that he should have never took that advice from them old men. So he was upset and knew he should have taken his advice. The cyclist had a feeling that he wasn't supposed to take it that way; he said he shouldn't have let them take a peek at his map. The overgrown path and unfamiliar landmarks confirmed his fears. So the features really affect him, solidifying his regret and frustration with the detour.
1415	7396	3	3	In “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie the main character faces a lot of trouble. First people give him the wrong directions, sending him off course. But, worst of all he has to travel a lot of miles on a bike through extreme temperatures, battling the scorching heat. Going up and down hills and pedaling really hard, he faces immense physical exertion. He doesn’t even have any cool water. As the character says, “followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees (Kurmaskie @NUM1).” That kind of water didn’t help him either. It didn’t quench his thirst because it was so hot; he said it tasted like battery acid and offered no relief. But, finally he worked up his confidence and kept pedaling till he found a fish camp that had a bathroom with a sink that had cool water, providing much-needed refreshment. Then he headed off to Yosemite and didn’t take anyone’s advice, relying on his own instincts and determination to guide him forward.
1416	7397	3	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist. The setting was a desert in California making it VERY hot outside, the sun beating down relentlessly. The hills were hard to climb and there were dangers all around such as poisonous snakes lurking in the shadows. Not just this was terrain hard to move around on but the path was thickest. ì@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.î This harsh environment combined to challenge the cyclist, making it harder for him to reach his destination.
1417	7398	3	3	In the towns that the cyclist arrived at were all ghost towns. In the text, the author said, ìit fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.î It affected the cyclist because, with the towns being deserted and lacking any open businesses, the cyclist couldnít refill his water. This lack of a water source in each empty town posed a significant challenge to the cyclist's journey.
1418	7399	3	3	The cyclist was motivated to get the job done. When they said only eighteen miles down the road, he thought it was going to be forever, but he made it because he conserved his water and kept on going. When the road turned into a rocky gravel road, he still kept on going, but it was harder on his legs and water supply, yet he persisted.
1419	7400	3	3	The condition the cyclist are in calls for a lot of preparation. The cyclist was in a hot desert area with winding roads and hills. The cyclist needs to have plenty of water to make it where he is going, and, as read in the story, the conditions almost caused health problems to the man who was trying to ride through. Therefore, appropriate planning is crucial for enduring such challenging environments.
1420	7401	3	3	Setting in ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî really determines how the story turns out. The setting was in deserted areas, the desert, and even roadways. In the desert, there is no water making the cyclist become dehydrated. Without water, he thought he was going to die. In the road areas, the speed limits was extremely high fifty-five miles per hour. This would not be good since he is doing ì a water-depleting @NUM1.î When he finds areas that are abandoned, these are water pumps, but the liquid that comes out @MONTH1 be water, but it tastes like ìbattery acid.î Setting can affect a lot in the story. Without this setting, the story would be a lot different than it is now, proving how crucial the environment is to the cyclist's struggle and the narrative's overall direction.
1421	7402	3	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist had a couple of problems turning his journey little, amount of water, tough roads, including there were no cars on the road either. It all caused a lot of difficulty for the cyclist like on page @NUM1 paragraph one the first sentence ìIt didnít really matter. In was going to die and the birds would pick me downî The elements were so tough on the cyclist that he or she was going to going to give hope. But luckly in the end the cyclist found a place to stop and get water with directions. The cyclist faced dehydration and exhaustion due to the arduous terrain and scarcity of resources. This paints a vivid picture of the cyclist's struggle against the harsh environment, but fortunately, a chance encounter provided the much-needed respite and guidance to continue the journey.
1422	7403	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is trying to get water but when he tried the pump, “a tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” The cyclist doesn’t have any water so it is difficult to go on, and the extreme heat and lack of hydration mean he could suffer from heat exhaustion. As he came to the next town, he found, “the building - abandoned years earlier, had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant.” Though abandoned, the factory serves as a desolate reminder of refreshment, a cruel irony given his thirst. He is still thinking of getting to the next town to get something to drink, driven by the desperate need for water. That is how the harsh features of the setting, both in their scarcity and in their mocking presence, directly affect the cyclist's struggle for survival.
1423	7404	3	3	In the story there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. One that had the greatest impact was that it was dry and hot, and that the terrain was very rough in the desert. Being that it was dry and hot made his ride hard. For example, the heat caused him to get dehydrated on his journey and begin to feel signs of heatstroke, such as dizziness and muscle cramps. The terrain caused an even bigger dilemma. For example, in the story him riding through that terrain causes him to get tired and become even more dehydrated than he already is, as the constant jarring and need to navigate obstacles sapped his energy. These environmental factors combined to create a truly challenging and dangerous situation for the cyclist.
1424	7405	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. First is the emptiness, the feeling that he is all alone. Not a car, person or building in sight. The fact that if something were to happen then there would be no way of telling anyone. That it would be a long while before anyone would be able to find him. Nor that might ease some, but I think it daunted him even more. It gave him that extra boost of energy that seems to have come out of nowhere. Then there is the type of animal. The desert environment is very unforgiving. The sun beats down like you're the only person on the planet. The lack of water, the food, the fact that it hasn’t rained in decades. The never-ending road. The ups and downs and all the animals that await him. The fact that if he stops at all, ever, then a snake could easily bite him and that would be the end of it. These extreme conditions and the harsh environment explained in the text greatly affect the cyclist, shaping his experience and driving his determination.
1425	7406	3	3	The setting of this short story affects the cyclist by making him dehydrated, leading to his death. He also found the abandoned factory in the setting, which makes him feel hopeless. If the setting were elsewhere, he would have felt different; without encountering the people of the reserve, he might have been on better roads instead of the old ones he was on. Thus, the harsh environment and isolation significantly contribute to the cyclist's tragic fate.
1426	7407	3	3	The countries of the setting that had the most effect on the cyclist were the deserts and hills. The author tells us first of his depleting water supply as he journeys through the high deserts of California in June. ìThe hills had a major effect on him because the intensive host that any desert contains, with this heat, his limited water, and the fact that it was June. Iím sure the author was most a happy person traveling within his intensive journey. Another misfortune that the author explains is the touring changing.î That road was replaced by a host rolling hills. ìWith my own experience, I know these cannot be a worse kind. Tall steep hills are a difficult climb, but your a living house the luxurious most to cool. In his mind too with, the authorís ìShort, rolling hillsî, the climb gets more miserable with every hill, and the coast down the other side barely cools your bare skin, leaving your thiving soul to continue in this dep pain. Iím sure the cyclist was experiencing a burned out spirit after just a few of those deadly hills, and the harsh landscape certainly contributed to the depletion of both his physical and mental resources. In effect, the combined challenges of the desert heat and relentless hills created a truly grueling experience.
1427	7408	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" greatly. He started off happy because he was going to Yosemite National Park and had gotten shortcut advice that would make his trip shorter. ""He rode into the morning with strong legs."" Then he got to the first stop, which looked like a buzzing town at one time, but was now a ghost town. So he kept on with plenty of water, thinking he could make it to the next stop. The next stop was an old abandoned gas station where the only water was rusty and unpalatable. He was hitting the water pretty regularly, and the hot sun was beating down on him. The terrain changed, and he thought he would die and have the vultures pick his bones because he took advice from old timers, then came to his next stop, which seemed to be an old Welch's grape juice factory, deserted and baking in the sun. He thought he would die of thirst but he kept on with little water and a hot sun. Next the hills came, and he paced himself for a little time. Then he finally came to a modern-looking place with cool running water and an old man who gave him directions that he gladly took. After assuring himself he would die, he was relieved to see the old man's place; he would forever on listen to their advice because he made it, understanding that local knowledge was valuable."
1428	7409	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because someone travelling a good distance in California during June will be hot. If the cyclist doesn’t have enough water to supply himself for if he gets lost then the features of the setting are very crucial. Not having enough water can cause someone to dehydrate, which does happen to the cyclist in the essay. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This statement proves that the cyclist wasn’t a good state to be lost when the sun is blazing down on him. Also, when you are dehydrated and tired you start to see things that aren’t there, but you want to see those things. “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited.” The cyclist's caution was wise because dehydration can severely impair judgment. Overall, features of a setting for a cyclist can cause anything to happen, so be careful.
1429	7410	3	3	"The features of the setting extremely affect the cyclist's ride to the meet town. It was bad enough that the cyclist had to adjust to being out of water, but on top of that, the varied terrain he faced, rolling hills, makes, and hard road conditions, all of these setting played a huge role in the cyclist's performance, ""it motued the terrain changing. that way was replaced by that rolling hills."" He also says ""tumbleweed around my matt and a includesouly change snake it really did look like a demand luck blocked the majority of the movement in front of me. These setting made it difficult for the cyclist to perform because the hills, snakes, and tumbleweed disturbed the cyclist's ability to advance in the ride. He ran out of water, and it was hard to reduce up hills, and the sight of a deadly snake made the cyclist nervous and worked to the difficulty of performance for the cyclist. Therefore, the harsh environmental elements clearly hindered the cyclist's ability to reach the meet town and significantly impacted their overall performance."
1430	7411	3	3	The features of the setting affecting the cyclist was like saying you are old and that you know nothing at all. But it is not true. It means you are older and that your information might not be correct, for example, in the essay when he was on his way to the town, he learned to use his map instead of a guy's opinion because the guy was wrong. The cyclist's reliance on his map ultimately proved more reliable than the outdated or inaccurate advice he received, demonstrating that firsthand experience and current information are crucial when navigating an unfamiliar environment. This highlights the importance of adapting to the present setting and verifying information rather than solely relying on past experiences or secondhand accounts, showing that accurate navigation depends on current understanding and adaptable strategies.
1431	7412	3	3	The first town the cyclist came to was like a ghost town because nobody was there. The next town wasnít any better because it was 25 miles down the road. The cyclist faced some problems while on the journey. Some of these problems included snakes, the fact that he was running out of water, the hill, and the condition of the road, making the already challenging ride even more difficult.
1432	7413	3	3	"The features of the setting in ""DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT"" affect the cyclist in a negative way. The terrain, initially mild, becomes rough and rolling, and since the author doesn't know the layout well, he struggles. Unsure of the path, he encounters obstacles like tumbleweed and snakes, further complicating his journey. The dwindling water supply adds immense stress, fueling worries about dehydration and the possibility of not reaching Yosemite National Park. However, with strength and determination, he finally arrives at Fish Camp, where he replenishes his water and regains his strength before continuing onward, ultimately demonstrating his resilience against the harsh environment."
1433	7414	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in a hot, dry place and has no water. He is pedaling up hills, and that makes him even more tired. The sun beats down relentlessly, baking the asphalt and radiating heat back up at him. His throat is parched, and his lips are cracked. The dude is probably dehydrated, and his conditions are getting worse! The combination of the harsh environment and physical exertion is clearly taking a toll, pushing him closer to exhaustion.
1434	7415	3	3	The features of the settings affects the cyclist a lot in the passage called ìRough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî. Cyclist are in very good physical shape. They can cycle for along time; however, weather can affect the cyclist. This happened in the passage. The cyclist was determined and confident he could make this journey. ìI would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Even though he had confidence the features of the setting affected the cyclist. ìTumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snakeÖ.î. ìThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sipsî. The cyclist was tired and exhausted; the relentless sun beat down, and the rough terrain made each pedal stroke a struggle. The weather and terrain had worn him down. The weather can change my level of ability sometimes. I love to play basketball outside. When it is hot and humid out I canít play as long. The features of a setting can clearly affect people.
1435	7416	3	3	"During this biker's adventure, heat and lack of water affect him. In this short story, when the cyclist feels lost he says, ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" This suggests that the rider was faced with the extreme heat of the desert during his ride, a common challenge for anyone undertaking such a journey. He also says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" This quote shows that not only was he faced with the heat, but also with lack of water, further compounding the difficulty of his situation. These facts and quotes show the clear threats this biker faced on his long bike ride, highlighting the physical and mental challenges inherent in such an endeavor."
1436	7417	3	3	The settings affect the cyclist in more than one way. These ways are that he is running out of water, he might become dehydrated and he is unsure of the path he is on. With him running out of water, he is in real trouble. Because of the lack of water, not only might he die but he begins to see mirages, further disorienting him. His lack of water eventually leads to dehydration and he become uneasy about things. For example; in the text it says that he staggered into the store, a clear sign of his weakened condition. Because he is unsure of the path he is on, he begins to panic a little. Panicing isnít good especially considering that he is running low on water and is becoming dehydrated. Panic canít help to solve anything. The setting is in a dessert so he needs lets of water, which he runs low on. Desserts are extremly hot which causes a person to become dehydrated or die. Desserts have little shade, if any; and they have rough weather as well as rough landscape. For example, theyíre landscape is mostly all hot sand. Therefore, the setting does affect the cyclist, exacerbating his already precarious situation and contributing to his physical and mental distress.
1437	7418	3	3	The setting which is a desert in the summer affects the cyclist. For example, she couldn’t go as fast, “The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph,” so that affected his ability to find water. The setting was also really hot, so the cyclist had a hard time getting the water he needed to keep going. For example, “I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn’t cool down.” This reveals how the setting has got on to him, and he needs water badly. The desert setting also affects the cyclist's mind, causing him to hallucinate. He believed he was seeing mirages and he was afraid he was going to swallow a stone because he might hit a bump, further demonstrating the psychological toll. The desert setting affects the cyclist's ability to function, highlighting the overall detrimental impact of the harsh environment.
1438	7419	3	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead” the features of the setting affect the cyclist. At points the setting made the author feel depressed and sad and at other times, happy and joyful. For example, the cyclist was pedaling and pedaling with nothing in sight. In twenty miles he saw camp, a sign that he was thirsty and had hope. When he pumped the water, no water came out. These parts of the setting gave the cyclist a bad effect. The cyclist even states ""life can be so cruel."" He obviously had a bad effect if he thought life was being cruel. At some point in the story the setting had a good affect on the reader. He is about to die of thirst when he sees a bait shop. This puts the cyclist in a good mood because he said “my troubles, thirst and fatigue, are all behind me.” Therefore, different settings in the story gave the author different effects."
1439	7420	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because the terrain you ride on can determine how you ride. For instance when you have hills and dry weather like they did when it said “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” the one easy terrain was now made more difficult and only added to his frustration and his dehydration from having no water. The change in terrain forced him to expend more energy. Also the heat contributed plenty and it was there the whole time. Sometimes he didn’t seem to notice or feel it but it was there and it was taking energy from him: Like when it said, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” He didn’t know it but that took from him so he drank more water and that affected his ability to take enough to complete the ride. Therefore, the environmental factors, both acknowledged and unnoticed, played a significant role in hindering the cyclist's performance.
1440	7421	3	3	The cyclist was riding in the hot, desert. This made him thirstier and less active. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, a testament to the relentless sun and draining ride, further diminishing his energy.
1441	7422	3	3	From my perspective, recycling impacts cyclists because improperly discarded trash, like soda cans, litters the environment. Cyclists often encounter this waste. Perhaps cyclists can encourage better recycling habits. Therefore, people should conserve materials for reuse, leading to improved resources and a better world for cycling and everyone.
1442	7423	3	3	The cyclist listens to the geogers, absorbing their local knowledge. After a while, he starts to get tired from the relentless pedaling. After the scenery drastically changes to a barren desert, he starts to get mad at the challenging conditions. He criticizes himself for accepting advice from ìold-timers who havenít left the village in years, realizing their tips were suited for easier terrain.
1443	7424	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He always kept his head up and was determined to make it to his destination. The first problem was when he came to the ""fork of sorts"" as he put it. He needed more water, but the pumps were rusty and all he could get out of them was a tarlike substance followed by blackish water. He tested it, hoping it was better than it looked, but it wasn’t. It tasted like battery acid. He was very thirsty, but had to move on, looking for another water supply. Another problem that occured was, while he was becoming dehydrated more & more by the minute and unsteady on his bike, a huge snake lay across the road. He had to slowly maneuver around it, though it was hard, he was successful and continued down the road. The third ""obstacle"" he ran into was he was so thirsty and finally had a chance for a drink, when to his dissappointment, he found an old abandoned welches grape juice factory. As nervie and upsetting as it was, he continued to move on, still determined to make it to his destination. He finally came up to a fishing supply store where he was able to take a break and get a nice drink! Even though the setting was tough, teasing, and ironic, the man made it through and still with a smile on his face."
1444	7425	3	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist because of his endurance. The terrain dictates the amount of time he can ride without stopping, while the steepness impacts how long he can ride uphill, and the road surface affects how many bumps he rides over. Finally, the climate influences how long he can ride without a drink of water. Therefore, the cyclist's endurance is constantly tested and shaped by the surrounding environment.
1445	7426	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the changes that occur while riding his bike. The cyclist began well with a smiley face, but then he changed because of the condition of the road and the weather that was hot; the smooth path turned bumpy and uneven. Also, there was not any signal to show him where he was going, confirming whether it was the correct way he was taking. Also, his bike tire went flat and needed to be replaced, adding to his frustration. Therefore, external elements played a significant role in changing the cyclist's initial cheerful mood.
1446	7427	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by for the roads and heat has. He was cycling through a desert in June which made it really hot for him, adding that the road was bumpy and that made him have to pedal harder. He had to put more effort into it because the roads were long and he had the spirit and determination to get to Yosemite. He also ran into a snake which told him that he was getting deeper into the desert, further emphasizing the challenges posed by the harsh environment and the long journey ahead.
1447	7428	3	3	The setting of the cyclist clearly influences his mood. From the beginning to end, the outside world reflects the tormils in his head. This is evident in the beginning reservoir, empty desert, hills the Welch factory, & finally the fish camp. The reservoir is a heven, a safe ground that contains everything the men needs. He is feeling optimistic, ready & eager to follow advice of old men. He first hits a ghost town, which is foreshadowing a dangerous future, but he passes through still with a level head. He comes to a water pump that gives him battery acid, and this is wher the mood shifts. He suddenly describes his setting as ìthe high deserts of California.î The sun is boiling down & water is running low, and his hopes start to drop. When the ìflat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,î it reflects the turmoil in his head; the terrain is harder and the chances of his survival lessens. When he crosses a snake, it suggest even more despair. It finally climaxes at the Welch factory. How ironic, it is an abandoned juice factory, representing lost hope. When he finally arrives at the fish camp, he is relieved to be alive & is uplifted. The cyclist has made it, and it is clear the setting has affected the cyclist throughout his journey.
1448	7429	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is riding his bike along the road and encounters a dilemma. Weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the pavement in front of me. He had to stop and was intimidated by the snake, which slowed him down and freaked him out. He had problems with thirst already and had to deal with a snake that really did look like a diamondback. He sees a building up ahead and discovers that it's a walrus Grape Juice factory. He thought that it might have some water but realized it was abandoned. Relating to his thirst, before he left he grabbed some pebbles. I'd read once that sucking on stones helps takes your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. He came across a fishing camp and received instructions on how to go on. This affected him because he got to a secure place and got proper directions and will learn from his mistake of listening to the older men at the beginning. The features of the setting, from the snake to the abandoned factory and the eventual fishing camp, all contributed to his challenges and ultimate success in navigating the journey, highlighting how environment shapes experience.
1449	7430	3	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him hope that the finishing line is not far, and there was nothing in sight – no cars, buildings, or structure of any kind. This stark emptiness, the unblemished horizon, further fueled his optimism, suggesting an unobstructed path to his goal. The clear view, devoid of distractions, allowed him to focus solely on the distance ahead, bolstering his belief that victory was within reach.
1450	7431	3	3	The author was affected in many ways by the conclusion. He was tired from the blazing heat, didn't have much water, and got lost. Water simply was limiting, and as he went farther and farther, it seemed like things would get worse and worse for him. A man had given him the wrong directions, and he probably hadn't been off his porch in decades, the author says, making the situation even more frustrating.
1451	7432	3	3	The cyclist explained how the road conditions changed as one progressed. An example was the sign: “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit.” Also, the road was dry. The cyclist pointed out that initially, the asphalt was smooth and well-maintained, allowing for comfortable riding. However, further along, the surface began to show signs of wear and tear, with cracks appearing and the occasional pothole marring the path. The texture changed, becoming coarser, and one could feel the vibrations through the handlebars. Consequently, reducing speed became a necessity for safety and comfort as the initial smooth road degraded considerably, requiring greater caution and awareness.
1452	7433	3	3	"In the story, there are many elements that affected the cyclist in his journey. The first feature of the setting that affects him is the old water pump, which did not work, and when it did, the water from it tasted horrible. The next obstacle on his journey was the rough terrain. ""Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,"" was how he described it. This change in elevation made the cycling significantly more difficult. When the narrator finally finds a building, it turns out to be abandoned and offered no help. Eventually he finds a town and rest after his long journey, and learns his lesson from before not to take advice from people he doesn’t know, showcasing the importance of self-reliance."
1453	7434	3	3	Well the features were rough desert like features. For a cyclist this terrain is difficult. For example the lack of water, and the battery acid flavor of what little they found, affected the cyclist in a major way. This made hydration a constant struggle, impacting performance and overall well-being on the arduous journey, severely hindering progress.
1454	7435	3	3	'Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills'' (Kurmaskie @NUM1). When the cyclist realized the terrain was becoming difficult, he became more frustrated and felt a sense of hopelessness. ''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt; and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. It was a sad, hopeless laugh'' (@NUM1). He wasn't going to die, but even though he was struggling, he felt the situation was overly dramatic. Fortunately, the man survived. He would live on, telling people not to blindly trust the advice of those detached from reality. ''Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office'' (@NUM3). He was on a long, hot road, and he started taking sarcastic jabs at the old men; he even planned to revise his writing about them. ''I made a mental note to change that paragraph'' (@NUM4). The man was not obligated to follow their directions. Ultimately, his decision to shorten his trip, coupled with the challenges of rough terrain, heat, and dehydration, led to feelings of hopelessness, anger, and self-pity, highlighting his somewhat self-centered reaction to the adversity he faced.
1455	7436	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cyclist is traveling through the high deserts of California in June, meaning the heat is intense and relentless. Another affect said in the story was that the cyclist made it to a town where the water pump was all rusted and with all his strength, he worked the handle and got a tarlike substance followed by brackish water which he couldn’t drink, leaving him desperate and dehydrated. Also, the cyclist had been hitting his water bottles regularly, indicating a growing concern about his dwindling water supply. Lastly, the old-timers said the towns would be close when really they were far apart, adding to his frustration and misguiding his expectations. These harsh conditions of heat, lack of water, and misinformation greatly impacted the cyclist’s physical and mental endurance.
1456	7437	3	3	"There are many things that can affect a cyclist's journey. This cyclist seemed to have bad wick. He starts off mentioning that he is planning a trip to Yosemite and the men that hear this give him a tip about a shortcut. The cyclist is pretty confident in what they tell him, so he follows their suggestions, trusting their supposed wisdom. He ends up getting lost due to the shortcut being outdated. The cyclist is also travelling in the high deserts of California in June. That means that he is travelling in summer with dry air, exacerbating dehydration. When he gets to the first ""town"" he sees, he can't get the water he needs to rehydrate his body, finding the place deserted. He also runs into a snake while travelling through the desert, which startles him and slows him down. Because it's hot, and he's tired and dehydrated, he begins to see mirages that affect him mentally, adding to his distress. All of these features cause the cyclist to take one long, tiring journey through the desert. These features also taught him the lesson to not take advise from old men who have not left their porch because their information might be out of date."
1457	7438	3	3	Well the setting was the lil boy was on the bike and he meets this old man and the man toke him a short cut. So he took dis road and I guess something went wrong. The shortcut looked harmless enough, but soon the path narrowed and grew dark, the trees closing in around him.
1458	7439	3	3	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the main character, the cyclist. After he first journeyed from the house where he met the old men, he rode over much flat desert terrain, where the sun beat down and dehydrated him. Soon, though the terrain changed. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This tests his endurance even more as he has to maneuver down the hills while dehydrated and ready to collapse from exhaustion. The relentless landscape, first flat and then hilly, thus becomes a powerful antagonist, pushing the cyclist to his physical limits.
1459	7440	3	3	Hot, @CAPS1, @CAPS2-all are the features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, the hot days with not a lot of water to drink will cause him to get dehydrated, impacting his performance. Also, there is no one around to help him if he gets lost or encounters trouble. Joe Kurmaskie explains ìthere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structur of any kind,î emphasizing the isolation. Finally the creature was a large snake that came along on the road, creating an unexpected obstacle. So he had to move around it, adding a moment of tension and potential danger to his ride, highlighting the challenges posed by the natural environment.
1460	7441	3	3	Setting is one of the most important needs for a cyclist if the terrain or weather are bad; the hotter it is for a cyclist, its necessary to supplement fluids and electrolytes to maintain performance and prevent dehydration.
1461	7442	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the cyclist faces challenging problems. For example, the terrain changes. A flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, and then a large highway. This shows that when he arrived, the road was not in good condition and required him to navigate a significant jump. The changing landscape clearly presents difficulties for the cyclist.
1462	7443	3	3	The oppressive heat of the setting threatened the cyclist, raising the risk of heatstroke and even death. A snake unexpectedly crossed his path, startling him, but he managed to get past it. He then spotted an abandoned Welch factory, a building that offered potential shelter but was ultimately unusable. Further down the road, he found a fish restaurant and gratefully used the bathroom to get some water. Inside, someone inquired about his destination and tried to mislead him, but thankfully he still had his map, so he decided to trust it and navigate his own way. Despite the challenges of the environment and the unsolicited advice, he remained focused on his map and relied on his own navigation.
1463	7444	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead,” a cyclist relies on outdated information from some older men, and their directions lead him astray, even proving dangerous. The setting exacerbates his predicament; he is in a desolate desert landscape dotted with ghost towns, and the intense heat diminishes his hope of survival. For example, at a fork in the road, he finds “several rusty pumps” and “one ramshackle shed.” Finding these decrepit structures, instead of a functioning water source, is demoralizing, especially with his dwindling water supply and the oppressive heat. The lack of usable resources further erodes his confidence. Later, the story emphasizes the desolation: “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This isolation significantly affects him because he has been cycling for a long time, is out of water, and is nearly exhausted. The absence of any sign of civilization diminishes his hope; he feels trapped in an empty desert with little chance of escape. In conclusion, in “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting plays a crucial role in undermining the cyclist's hope and confidence, because the abandoned and scorching desert environment amplifies his sense of despair and reduces his belief in his ability to survive the ordeal.
1464	7445	3	3	"Well since the cyclist is in a desert and out of water, he is probably not going to be happy. The ""ghost towns"" aren't really a boost of confidence either, adding to his feelings of isolation. The rugged hills made him angry too, forcing him to dismount and push his bike. The heat affected him the most, sapping his strength and making the journey even more arduous."
1465	7447	3	3	The features of the land affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the first two buildings that he came to were abandoned, so he could not get any food or water to replenish his energy. Also, he noticed that the terrain was changing from flat to rolling hills, and this change will certainly put more strain on his legs as he pedals uphill. Finally, the land was hot and dry, which was making him dehydrated and impacting his performance. This is how the features of the land affected the cyclist and his journey.
1466	7448	3	3	In this story the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. He tries to get directions but the people he asked really didn't know what they were talking about, offering vague gestures and uncertain nods. That's why you have to be careful about who you ask for help. Then he needs a drink, hoping for some refreshment, but that doesn't work out too well because the water from the old pump ends up tasting like battery acid, leaving a metallic tang in his mouth. Then the cyclist begins to be on his way again and finds the same difficulty in the road. The road is in bad condition, riddled with potholes and loose gravel, and he must go slower than the speed limit. At this point, with the sun beating down and his throat parched, it felt like he was going to die. Luckily, he found a dilapidated gas station with a working bathroom and gratefully drank from the sink, the cool water a welcome relief. The setting's challenges truly tested his endurance.
1467	7449	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. Early in the essay, the cyclist states he “enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers.” The cyclist was enjoying himself and the atmosphere, but then the mood changed quickly to doubt when he didn't listen to the “collection of old-timers who havent left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” and his depleting water source quickly became a cause for concern. Doubt was soon followed by relief when he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp and was able to get a drink from the bathroom faucets. Relief was then followed by satisfaction when he “promised himself right then that he'd always stick to [the very good map] in the future,” demonstrating how the challenges presented by the unfamiliar setting ultimately led to a valuable lesson learned.
1468	7450	3	3	The setting had a bad affect on the author in many ways. One reason is that the heat of the setting caused the author to become dehydrated. Dehydration is when your body begins to shut down due to lack of water, and this sapped his strength. The setting also affected him by draining his confidence and making him seek out water. Finding none, ìI hung my head,î which suggests that he was depressed and discouraged by the harsh conditions. This proves that no matter who or what you follow there is always a possibility of death from any circumstances. Therefore this is how the author was affected by the setting he was biking.
1469	7451	3	3	I think the settings made it a little more challenging, preventing one from giving up easily. This also shows that you often do better in life when challenged and pushed beyond your comfort zone, ultimately leading to growth.
1470	7452	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it is in a warm, dry climate, causing him to sweat profusely and requiring him to drink more water. When no one else was around, it was more difficult for him to continue, especially if there was a chance that he was on the wrong path, with nobody available to tell him otherwise. With only abandoned buildings, if any, water was unavailable, which made the journey more tiring and physically straining. If the setting were different, with cooler temperatures and populated areas, this story would not have been as traumatic, emphasizing the critical role of environment in shaping experience.
1471	7453	3	3	THERE ARE VAST FEATURES IN THE SETTING THAT AFFECTS THE CYCLIST. In several ways one feature would be the “sun beginning to heat down,” as that made the cyclist hot and thirsty. The thirsty-ness reduced him to use his limited supply of water. So the sun was able to effect him a couple of ways. Another feature that caused some problems for the cyclist were the run down “ghost towns” that consists of “ram-shackle sheds” and “several rusty pumps.” These features led the cyclist to feel hopelessness, as well as the problem that they didn’t have any water for him to fill up with as he became dehydrated. Obstacles such as “tumbleweeds” and “pavement blocking snakes” also plays a role in affecting the cyclists as he move on the “@NUM1 road” only doing “12 MPH.” One final, and last obstacle was the terrain he rode on. The obstacle being a “long cropping hill,” this made the cyclist exhausted, as he uses much energy to summer the hell, he was likely left wondering if he would reach his destination at all. Ultimately, it is clear that the cyclist faced numerous environmental challenges that significantly impacted his journey.
1472	7454	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The features of the setting affect a cyclist, or the major problem that a cyclist encounters, are rough roads, bike inspection, and equipment. Maintaining the speed limit and using equipment, I don't think there are features of the setting affect a cyclist. For a cyclist to maintain the speed limit of @NUM1 or face water depletion, sometimes life can feel so cruel. Tumbleweeds are caused by speeding, but with the necessary equipment, injuries are minimized. A better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be ìNever accept.
1473	7455	3	3	"The features of the setting really affected the cyclist. The author wrote of rough terrain and isolation. ""Flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake."" After reading this information and the descriptions, I inferred that the author was alone in the desert with awful conditions. I also infer a tone of resentment. He seemed to wish he hadn't taken the ""shortcut"" that landed him in the desert. The hot weather was another factor that affected the author, ""trying to keep my balance in a dehydrated state."" He seems to have not really planned how long the ride would be and how to conserve water. The rough terrain, desolation, and hot temperatures seemed to have affected the cyclist/author, contributing to his growing regret about his ill-fated decision."
1474	7456	3	3	"The features of the setting that most affected the cyclist were the water pump, the Welchís Factory, and the fish camp. The pump affected him because he was very thirsty, and at first he thought he would have a chance to get water, he was excited and he pumped the water out, as he wrote, ìwith all my strength.î But he had to go on thirsty, (a very risky thing to do while cycling) because ìit had the flavor of battery acid.î Next, the Welchís Factory affected him by killing his spirits. He was already feeling bad from the lack of water, but seeing the mocking, ironic image of ìa sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juiceî, made him feel worse. It reflected his own desperate situation, all refreshments in the past, there was nothing left. I had a similar experience once. I am alergic to peanuts. One time, on a long car trip, I had slept through lunch, so I was starving, and we were on a long stretch of highway with no buildings to be seen. After two hours, we finally saw a sign for a nearby restaurant: @CAPS2ís peanut shack. I nearly cried. The last thing that affected the cyclist was the fish camp. It saved his life. He arrived and ""drank deeply from the sink."" He was so happy that he wanted to kiss the owners of the camp. This also relates to the car trip I mentioned, because after hours of hunger, we found a very good sushi bar, and sushi is my favorite food, thus illustrating how the environment can profoundly impact one's physical and emotional state."
1475	7457	3	3	The story that I am doing the most was going to talk about what happen in the story I was not shore but the name of the story sound prety good if I was in the story I not be good becaus the story is really crazy I would be realy good two start and right. I am eager to delve into its events. The title intrigues me, even if the narrative unfolds in unpredictable ways. If I were a character within it, I fear I wouldn’t fare well given its chaotic nature. However, I possess the skills to craft a compelling opening and write.
1476	7458	3	3	In the setting they are in Lodi, California. That area is close to the desert, and the arid environment greatly affects the cyclist. For one it is really hot. Two the heat is making him thirsty and he is quickly running out of his water. Then last he is near no towns so he can’t easily get anymore water, so the setting undeniably affects the cyclist and his challenging journey.
1477	7459	3	3	The cyclist is most affected by the heat. He is exerting all his energy and will to get to Yosemite. The hot sun and lack of water makes him very tired and causes him to use his energy inefficiently, draining his strength. At one point, he has to make sure the building is not a mirage. It is so hot his mind could be playing tricks on him, distorting reality and making him question what he sees. The heat's impact is significant, impairing not only his physical ability but also his perception.
1478	7460	3	3	The conditions that the cyclist was in was very horid as he continued on his ride; the sun beat down mercilessly. He got hotter and hotter, desperately hoping to find water after he finished off his last bit in his bottle. Taking advice from an old man he encountered by the roadside was his last decision he made, a decision he hoped wouldn't lead him further astray.
1479	7461	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because sometimes, it made him lose some courage and optimism. ""and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day"" is an example of how he lost courage. He wanted to be brave and be strong, but the hot day and all the sweat made the author feel weak. ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear"" is an example of how the author lost some optimism. He didn’t want to die, but he kept telling himself that he was going to; he should have thought to himself that he was going it make it, but the setting was just to rough. The harshness of the environment, coupled with the cyclist's physical discomfort, stripped away his positive outlook. There were bumps along his ride, and the sun beating down his thirst, he became less courageous and less optimistic, demonstrating the powerful influence of the setting on his mental state, diminishing his initial resolve."
1480	7462	3	3	"The features of his journey are cruel. ""Rolling hills"" make him work harder to get over them. The more he works, the more he sweats, and therefore he needs fluids to do so. The lack of water he has does not help his dehydration. Poisonous plants don't really bother him if he leaves them alone. The condition of the roads adds onto the hills. Rough roads make him work harder to get through and then over the hills, increasing his exhaustion. So this guy is getting it pretty rough on his arduous journey."
1481	7463	3	3	"Some of the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the rough terrain and the hills. It says in the reading ""a flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,"" this would wear a person out without a good supply of water and make him unsure in what direction he is traveling. And another thing that affects him is the hot June weather in California, which would certainly increase the risk of dehydration and exhaustion on such a physically demanding ride. Thus, these environmental factors combined to create a challenging and potentially dangerous situation for the cyclist."
1482	7464	3	3	Throughout ìRough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist was traveling through a very dry area, where it was very hot, dry and dangerous. There was no water to be found and the terrain is were rough and bumpy. The speaker stated, ìAt some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously lareg snake...î (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist faced land blockings and dangerous animals, forcing him to navigate carefully. This caused him to slow down a little bit. It was extremely hot out in the setting he was in. The cyclist was in the deserts of California in June. The speaker stated, ì@CAPS1 rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on gorgeous day in June...î (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was experiencing the high temperatures of the setting, battling dehydration. The cyclist witnessed the intense features of the setting, impacting his journey and highlighting the harsh realities of the environment.
1483	7465	3	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. The relentless heat and barren landscape contribute to his mental state; he becomes delusional when he said that if he were lucky one of the stones would be lodged in his throat, illustrating the desperation induced by the harsh environment. Also, he is dehydrated because he uses all of his water and is having to push hard to make it to the next town, further demonstrating how the demanding setting takes a toll on his physical and psychological well-being. The challenging environment, therefore, profoundly impacts the cyclist, pushing him to his limits.
1484	7466	3	3	The features of the setting started out easy like a road that's flat, cool lines to keep him cool and not hot. Then it got harder, lack of water, road is not flat anymore, snakes, the cool pines are gone. The sun beat down relentlessly, and the cracked earth offered little respite, showing the shift from a welcoming path to an unforgiving trial.
1485	7467	3	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month. There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or creek for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the effect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cow skull, as in movies. Deserts are intimidating; they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water, the thought of death, how he was, ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean,"" was running through his now-terrified head. Had he been in a city or in rolling farmland, he might not have been as terrified; those places offer perceived safety. There are people in those places, and places to be safe there, but, in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair and make rash decisions. Setting does a lot to influence stories, so it is important to keep that in mind when reading."
1486	7468	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was out of water in a desert-like environment, and there was no firm ground for most of it, so he was on his own. The cyclist was affected in the story when he says, ""I got down on my hands and knees, working the water handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar-like substance oozed out followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" That affected him because he was drinking a lot of water before he got to that point in his trip, and he was almost out, so he desperately needed to replenish his supply. The harsh, desolate setting, devoid of reliable resources, left him with no readily available place to get more water. This lack of access to potable water, a direct consequence of the environment, significantly impacted his situation."
1487	7469	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by getting dehydrated, getting tired, and by getting lost. After the cyclist was on the road for a while he had drank almost all of his water, but he still had a while to go before he got to his destination. He was going to try to find somewhere to stop so he could pick up more water but there was nothing around, just the seemingly endless road stretching before him. He also got tired because he was out in the sun, had barely any water, and he didn’t know where he was going, making the journey physically and mentally draining. One last example was that he was lost. There were no cars, buildings, or people to ask for directions or offer assistance. So if he were to get hurt or sick no one would have been able to help him, leaving him vulnerable and isolated. In conclusion, being dehydrated, tired and getting lost were the ways the features of the setting affected the cyclist, highlighting the harsh and unforgiving nature of his surroundings.
1488	7470	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he runs out of water because he is trying to traverse the terrain. In the setting there is a desert in California that he is riding through on a bike, ""I was travelling through the high deserts of California."" The word ""high"" means that there were hills which would make the journey even more difficult, requiring more exertion and thus more water. The hills appeared later in the story as the cyclist said ""flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" When the speaker says ""replaced"" he is trying to show a change of terrain, indicating a shift from easier to more challenging riding. Another feature of the setting is the tumbleweed that he crosses after the hills, ""tumbleweeds crossed in path."" The tumbleweeds made him remember he was in the desert because tumbleweeds are associated with the desert which brought up the thought of dying and being picked apart by birds. The harsh desert environment, with its hills and sparse vegetation, clearly contributes to the cyclist's struggle and eventual dehydration."
1489	7471	3	3	Well if the setting relates to the theme then the story will make sense, like if it’s a sad story and it’s a ugly rainy day then it will match very nicely. That’s how the setting makes it better, enhancing the overall impact and emotional resonance of the narrative through its descriptive elements.
1490	7472	3	3	If it is hot out you can dehydrate quickly. Also, if it is off road and hilly you use a lot of energy. It can be rough on equipment, body, and mind. Make sure you dress appropriately and carry lots of water. Next, make sure your tires are inflated and all equipment is working properly. Then, plan a good route that you can stop at places and catch a breath or some water. Also, make sure you eat well, food provides a lot of energy. These preparations will help ensure a safer and more enjoyable experience.
1491	7473	3	3	"In the setting of the essay; ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" had a great affect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through. For example, ""At some point, tumber weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-back the majority of the pavement in front of me, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" The author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to easy on by. The terrain affect the character by keeping him determined. This happens to many people in their sports, pushing through adversity to reach their goals. For example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game. Therefore, the challenging terrain in the essay serves as a catalyst for the cyclist's determination, mirroring how athletes in various sports harness obstacles to fuel their drive and persevere."
1492	7474	3	3	"In the story the cyclist was affected. The cyclist was affected by the directions of the old man. It says that they gave it to him to help him out. That it was a shortcut. I think the cyclist thinks the directions are out of date. The reason I think this is that in the second sentence of the story it says, ""never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office."" The feature of the setting also affected him because he had to ride up and down through what he thought of as rough terrain. These outdated directions and the challenging landscape, therefore, contributed to the cyclist's difficulties on his journey."
1493	7475	3	3	"In Joe Kurmaskieís ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî the features of the setting affect the cyclist alot. The terrain has a great deal to do with it. Also, the heat: First, the terrain affects the cyclist. It affects the cyclist because there is alot of hills. The text says, ""With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.î In order to go down a hill, you had to have gone up a hill. So, having to use the energy to pedal up hills affected the cyclist alot. Also, constantly changing gears for the inclines and declines would add to the physical strain. Next, the heat affected the cyclist. I know this because the text says ìand the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.î This proves it is extremely hot outside. Heat would affect the cyclist because heat prevents you from functioning at your greatest ability. The cyclist is clearly pushing his limits in these conditions. That is how the features of the setting in ëDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî affect the cyclist. The terrain affects the cyclist because of the hills. The heat because it drains your energy quick."
1494	7476	3	3	In ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed posted speed limit,î the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way it affected him is the towns were old and deserted. In the story he said ìThis place might have been a thriving little spot but it was a ghost town.î He could not get any water or any directions, leaving him stranded and unsure of his path. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because the roads were bumby and there were many hills. ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î Consequently, the cyclist had to use all his power to manuever over the hills, draining his energy. The third reason why the setting affected the cyclist was the weather and that it was a desert. ìI was traveling through the deserts of California in June.î He was hot, sweaty and thirsty, struggling against the harsh conditions. He was also tired and desperate to find water and a town that was not deserted, highlighting the severity of his situation. The features of the setting affected the cyclist in ìRough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit,î by the roads, deserted towns and the lack of water, all contributing to his increasingly difficult journey.
1495	7477	3	3	ìRough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limits.î The setting is a long road with no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. The cyclist could be affected by the rough road that he has to ride down; the jarring bumps threaten to throw him off balance. The sign serves as a stark reminder of the challenges ahead, urging caution and awareness, as the cyclist must heed the warning to safely navigate the rough terrain.
1496	7478	3	3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his experience of bike riding in the desert. The setting affects the cyclist in many ways throughout the writing. At first, Kurmaskie is confident as he listens to a group of old codgers giving him advice. The setting is calm and happy and Kurmaskie writes that he ìenjoyed the serenity of an eary-summer eveningî. The word ìserenityî gives the affect of calm and peace, reflecting his initial optimism. However, as Kurmaskie proceeds into his journey, the setting changes. He is troubled by the ìramshackle shed, several rutsy pumps, and a corral that couldnít hold the lamest muleî in a ghost town that he meets in the desert, suggesting a loss of hope. Even later, the terrain changes and he sees a sign stating ìRough Road Aheadî, further diminishing his spirits. Kurmaskieís confidence turns into even deeper doubt and worry as his water supply runs low, amplifying the harshness of the environment. Finally, Kurmaskie sees a sign for a fish camp. Here, his hope returns as he finds a ìrather modern bathroomî where he can stop to get a drink, signaling a shift back to optimism. As the setting changes, Kurmaskieís confidence is followed by determination and then relief, demonstrating the powerful influence of the environment on his emotional state and journey.
1497	7479	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in a desert-like place with only a mirage of a water surface, and he could get tired quickly. I would never have asked old people for help; he should have asked someone who was in charge of a store, because those people likely get asked for directions many times. Also, he could have died if that snake had bitten him, or from what he said, ""heatstroke."" Thus, the harsh environment posed significant dangers, and seeking informed help was crucial for survival."
1498	7480	3	3	"Having diligently collected directions from a series of venerable old men, the cyclist confidently embarked on his journey to Yosemite National Park. The initial amusement at discovering the first town to be a complete ghost town didn't shake his conviction. However, arriving at a desolate spot marked by ""one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule"" began to erode his certainty, especially as his water supply dwindled alarmingly. The landscape unfolded with rolling hills, the occasional snake slithering across the path, and the relentless tumbleweeds, each element chipping away at his initial enthusiasm. The abandoned juice factory proved to be a particularly devastating blow, the sight of it a cruel reminder of his parched throat and fading hope. Finally, reaching Gary Wilber's fish camp and replenishing his water supply was a turning point, revitalizing not only his body but also his dwindling spirits. With each discouraging landmark passed, the author's confidence waned, highlighting how the absence of hope can be as debilitating as physical hardship when pursuing even the sunniest and breeziest of vacations, ultimately draining one's inner reserves."
1499	7481	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist negatively because he was in the desert in the summer with little water and no stores to get a drink at. For example, he says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This explains how his setting affected him because he had nowhere to go or get a drink, emphasizing his isolation. This harsh environment, devoid of resources and human contact, clearly presented a significant challenge to his survival and well-being. That is my reason why the cyclist's settings were negative.
1500	7482	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in bad ways. The rocky road and steep hills made him peddle harder, straining his muscles with each rotation. The old people made him go through the rocky way when they pointed him in the wrong direction. The temperature from the desert made him thirsty so he ran out of water fast, He said ìWhen I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.î The heat could have killed him anytime. For example ìWide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from the heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.î This ride this man took to Yosemite was a very dangerous ride, and the harsh environmental factors contributed significantly to the peril he faced.
1501	7483	3	3	"The setting can greatly affect the cyclist. The place can change what happens and how it happens. For example, if the story had taken place in Alaska, the cyclist would not have had, ""Wide rings of sweat circling my shirt,"" and instead have been fighting off hypothermia. The setting is very important because it affects all of the details in the writing, influencing everything from the cyclist's clothing to the challenges they face, ultimately shaping the narrative."
1502	7484	3	3	At first the terrain was fine and he confident. But when he reached the first town it looked like one of those ghost towns in the movies. The next town didn't come up when he was told it would. The terrain was that of a desert, no water for miles. His throat felt like sandpaper, but he stayed determined. And he made it to some water though, a small spring bubbling weakly from the parched earth, just enough to quench his thirst and renew his resolve.
1503	7485	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” For example, he finds a “ramshackle shed” and tries to find water. It affected him, because it says, “I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” The quote meaning that he was determined to find water and perhaps anything. The desolate and unforgiving environment, characterized by the shed's disrepair and the pump's rusted state, directly contributes to his desperation and willingness to endure discomfort in his search. This illustrates how the harsh setting shapes his actions and highlights the challenges he faces.
1504	7486	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist by depriving him of hydration and weakening him. The demanding environment, with its lack of water sources, took a toll. The large hills and rough roads ebbed away every bit of his strength and wore him down. The narration states, ìOver one long, crippling hillî (kurmaskie @NUM1). This word choice reflects the writerís feeling about his adventure. Words like ìlongî and ìcripplingî show that the trip was a horrible experience, highlighting the arduous and painful nature of the journey.
1505	7487	3	3	"Pride, determination, relief – all are things that the cyclist felt during his long bike ride. First, the cyclist started off riding on fresh legs and good directions, but after a while down the road he started to doubt the old men, “a diary with my last entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and their been a sense of direction, I made a mental move to change it.” After feeling that the direction might be rough, he rode out of pride to get to his destination, pushing onward despite his growing uncertainty. Next, the rider had great determination to get to his destination and did many things, “I gathered – a few pebbles and stock them in my mouth to take my mind off of thirst.” This quote shows that he would do almost anything to keep going, enduring discomfort to stay on course. Finally, the cyclist was fatigued when he arrived at the @CAPS1 shop because he then knew the old men were right and would reach his destination, “As I stumbled into rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink this quote shows he was polite naturally to get water but to know the men were right."" Ultimately, the cyclist experienced a range of emotions, from doubt to determination, culminating in the relief of reaching his destination and acknowledging the wisdom he had initially questioned."
1506	7488	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist when he was thirsty. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could be seen. This proves that the rider was thirsty because the previous paragraph describes his last burst of energy going down a hill. He was also sweating a lot and wiping sweat from his eyes, further suggesting dehydration and the need for refreshment. The image, therefore, highlights his physical state and intensifies the feeling of thirst.
1507	7489	3	3	I work better when I can feel the environment. I think the same goes for cycling in the mountains; fresh air and no worries on your mind, then cycling can become fun. Like the climates into the ease, even the fresh air, the fine trees, and the environment makes him feel better, so for cyclists, the environment plays a vital role, enhancing the overall experience and enjoyment.
1508	7490	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. The setting affected the cyclist's performance. For example, the harsh temperature started to make his pedaling sluggish, and his muscles began to ache sooner than usual. The settings also made the cyclist a little frightened; for instance, the cyclist came across a snake that he was terrified of, causing him to momentarily lose his balance. Again, the settings affected the cyclist by tempting him. For example, the river tempted the cyclist to stop riding and go get a drink of water, slowing his progress. In conclusion, the setting had a major affect on the cyclist.
1509	7491	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, a lot of the settings discouraged the cyclist. This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. As soon as the cyclist hits this ""town"" he realizes that the old men's advice might not have been so great. The dry desert affects the cyclist the most. This hot climate makes the cyclist extremely thirsty, hot, and sweaty. ""Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke..."" The cyclist's tone here is sarcastic but he is still concerned about his health because of the heat and lack of water. The fact that there is nothing living around the cyclist also affects him. Since he’s talked to the old men for directions he hasn’t seen a glimpse of life, or buildings or anything, not even a stray animal. So this definitely discourages the cyclist and makes him lose his will to continue his journey. In conclusion, the features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist in many negative ways, from his physical discomfort to his dwindling motivation."
1510	7492	3	3	The cyclist tracked through a barren land trying to get to a land of rivers and valleys. Tracking through the first town, the cyclist saw a ramshackle shed, rusty pumps, and corral located in the desert of California. The cyclist was very angry that the old men led him into this barren town; however, he kept hope and traveled to the next town. There, he found an abandoned fruit juice factory and bottling plant; this discouraged the cyclist, and he started to give up. “I was going to die,” he claimed, with all hope lost. The man feels like there is nothing left, and it's the old men who caused this. Then finally, he came across a bait shop, which he found on his own, giving him huge relief. The features affect his attitude because in a barren land, you lose hope, as did the cyclist. Therefore, what's around us affects us, as in education, friendship, and survival, demonstrating how the environment significantly shapes our perspectives and chances.
1511	7493	3	3	In the essay, ìRough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,'' the cyclist is affected both emotionally and physically by the features of the setting. At the start, when he came to a deserted shed with rusty pumps, he began to feel discouraged. ì[The] sight was troubling,î (page @NUM1) as the desolation hinted at challenges ahead. Later on in the essay, the terrain changes from flat land to short, rolling hills and tumbleweeds began to pass. The cyclist is definitely affected by the change in terrain. He is now exhausted but continues to pump his legs and ride on, demonstrating a physical struggle against the environment. Before the end of his ride, the cyclist reaches an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The setting now includes a large picture of a young boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice. The author seems almost defeated by this. ìI hung my head'' (page @NUM2) he confessed, perhaps feeling a pang of longing. In the end, once he finds an old fisherman's store, he is relieved; seeing the store from a distance excited the author, because he could finally have a drink. The author's mood and body were greatly affected by the features of the setting.
1512	7494	3	3	"The features of the setting in ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie show that as the day goes on the cyclist becomes tired and worn out from his long ride through rough terrain trying to find his way back home; the unforgiving landscape clearly takes its toll. Then he saw some buildings down a hill and said, ""With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill"" (Kurmaskie). After the arduous journey, the rider, surprisingly, gets home and immediately anticipates doing it again, suggesting an unexpected appreciation for the challenge despite the demonstrated hardships."
1513	7495	3	3	The main affect is the lack of water. It is in June, while riding his bike in California. Therefore it’s going to be very hot and he’ll need a lot of water to stay hydrated. When he sees that Welch’s Grape Juice factory, it just makes him think of his thirst even more. Also the terrain he is riding is not the easiest. He starts out riding on flat ground but then is riding on hills and not so flat terrain. This didn’t help his dehydration. That's why you should always carry a lot of water with you if you’re riding a bike during the summer, especially given the intense sun and exertion involved in cycling.
1514	7496	3	3	The affects of the settings was how hot it was and the cyclist road he was on. The rider said it was June in the summer time, very hot, making the ride physically taxing. And the roads were not smooth, they were very old and ragady, adding to the challenge.
1515	7497	3	3	The sun beat down, each ray a tiny hammer against the cyclist's resolve. He focused on the road ahead, a ribbon of shimmering asphalt snaking through the hills. The heat rose from the pavement, a palpable force. His water bottle, already light, offered little comfort against the mounting thirst. Each uphill climb was a fresh assault, testing his endurance. He gripped the handlebars, his knuckles white as he navigated around a particularly rough patch, the jarring impact sending vibrations through his weary arms. Despite the harsh conditions, he pressed on, driven by a silent determination to conquer the ride, pushing through the discomfort, the challenge becoming a personal test.
1516	7498	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is trying to bike up hills and down hills, which can be very tiring. Also, the hot air can dehydrate him, which can cause him to pass out. Along with the dry air, there is dry land, which means there is no place to stop for water or take a **break**. The rough **terrain** make the biking harder because it involves more energy than biking on a smooth path. Finally, the snake in the middle of the road made it hard for the biker to go around. If the snake would have bitten him he could have died from poison. Thus, the environmental conditions and unexpected wildlife encounters significantly impede the cyclist's journey, making it both physically demanding and potentially dangerous.
1517	7499	3	3	"The setting in the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" was very hot and dry, with very little shade or moisture, at some point maybe even none at all. This weather affected the author because he had no water at all, so he was getting more dehydrated the further he went, making the journey increasingly arduous and impacting his physical state."
1518	7500	3	3	"The cyclist's predicament stemmed directly from ignoring the adage, ""Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office."" This affected his journey because if he hadn't shown them his map and allowed them to offer their unsolicited opinions, he likely would have avoided considerable trouble. He trusted their outdated knowledge, which ultimately led him astray, demonstrating how adhering to this specific feature of the setting—avoiding advice from those disconnected from the present reality—could have significantly altered his experience for the better."
1519	7501	3	3	In ìRough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie the setting of the terrain was hot and water draining. In the text it says ìFollowed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degreesî this proves that the cyclist is exaggerating about the very hot temperature of the high deserts of California. The cyclist humorously describes the water's extreme heat, adding to the challenging atmosphere. The setting is also water draining and had to stop in the desert town to refill his water bottle as in the text says ìI got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of a rusted water pump with all my strength.î This proves that the cyclist had to stop for water and using much power to pump it out. The struggle to obtain water highlights the harsh conditions and the cyclist's determination. In conclusion always prepare for the worst but hope for the best.
1520	7502	3	3	"In the story, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. One setting feature is the rolling of steep hills. The hills make the cyclist exhausted and even more desperate for water. For example, in the story it says, ìOver one long crippling hill, a building came into viewî. This shows that the hill was very hard and strenuous to get over. By using the word crippling it informs us that the hill was brutal and very hard to get over. This also makes the cyclist very tired and question whether or not he can even make it to his destination. Another setting feature that affects the cyclist is the absence of any civilization on his cycling path. While he was riding he notices that there is nobody around to help him if he gets in trouble or needs water. The absence of people makes him feel stressed and worried about his journey. It shows this in the story when he say, ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kindî. Also it says in the story ìI was going to die and the bird would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear and a diary with the last entry on the parse of old men"". This shows that there was nobody around to help him and he knew it. He thought he would die alone and that birds would eat him. He was obviously worried about the absence of people, which amplified his feelings of isolation and despair. Thus, the harsh landscape and lack of human presence significantly contribute to the cyclist's struggle."
1521	7503	3	3	Usually the features, setting has a major effect upon the cyclist. The features, setting relates, and describes the harsh, and eventually relief condition of the cyclist. The setting relates to the person and plays a role, which the cyclist can observe. One reason how the features of the setting affects the cyclist is it shows the various problems that are being faced with the cyclist. For example, the cool pines, no one in sight, and I am alone. The way how this interepts a clear meaning, I the cyclist needs help getting home, and eventually by traveling, he needs water, to fill his thirst. Prior to this, the features, shows the weakness of the cyclist. For example, with that i believed it was my last burst of energy, as I consently, maneuvered down the hill. The features, and settings, affect the cyclist by showing how he was facing his troubles, thirst and fear, which all lead behind him at the end. These features and settings develop a clear understanding, for the cyclist, and what is to be expected, in by him. For instance, the isolation of the setting amplifies the cyclist's vulnerability, while the downhill path offers a glimmer of hope despite his exhaustion. Ultimately, the setting acts as a mirror reflecting the cyclist's internal struggles and his eventual triumph over them.
1522	7504	3	3	"The features of the setting had a big impact on the cyclist. When he started that ride, he was confident that the ìold timersî were right about which directions and roads he had to take to get to Yosemite National Park. Though the sun was bearing down, he refused to give up, just as he saysî The sun was beginning to beat down, but I hardy noticed.î He came up to places that were worn down and deserted, so he knew he was alone if anything happened. The desert heat had made him down his water pretty regularly, so he tried to get more, as in, ""I got on my hands and knees When l tried a drop or two, it has the flavor of battery acid"" paragraph @NUM1. He was so thirsty that he would drink hot water. Then he thought he has only @NUM2 miles to go, so he kept going. He weakening as he pedaled along the changing terrain as he was ìtrying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ìWith what little energy he had last, he had passed an abandoned Well be Grape Juice factory, which probably tested his patience and sanity. He had resorted to, ìgathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouthî just to keep his mind off his thirst. He was losing hope when he came upon ì Gary and wilberís fish camp best betî then he felt relieved after he was able to get cool water. By then he's learned his lesson, to stick to his map, as the harsh, unforgiving landscape ultimately forced him to abandon his reliance on outdated advice and embrace a more reliable method of navigation."
1523	7505	3	3	"In the author's recollection of his long and tiresome bike ride he talked about the struggles he had to face. When he set out that morning he asked some old guys on a porch for directions to Yosemite. They told him that they knew the way and that they knew a shortcut. He chose to take their advice but later regretted it. When he found the towns that they spoke of all he found was ghost towns. ""Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office."" He does eventually reach a town where he finds signs of life. There he asks another old guy if he knows the way to Yosemite; the guy says he has a good map. All along his ride he was plagued by the sun and lack of water. The sun made him hot and thirsty, which forced him to drink a lot of his water. When he reached his last few sips he resisted from drinking it and began losing consciousness. ""I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."" His poor choices and the harsh conditions nearly proved fatal, highlighting the importance of reliable information and adequate preparation for such a journey."
1524	7506	3	3	A cyclist can only travel as fast as slow as he pedals. If the setting is a humid sunny day he can’t go too fast due to his lung capacity being limited in the thick air. If it is a warm but windy day he has to watch his speed to keep from getting hurt by a sudden gust. Basically unless the weather is nice or safe enough, he will not go fast, valuing safety. But his safety care comes first, so it depends on the weather mostly, but also the time of the day. If it is night [dark] the reflectors must be put on to keep from getting hit. Thus, the cyclist's speed is a careful balance between physical ability, environmental conditions, and safety precautions.
1525	7507	3	3	"The features in the setting affecting the cyclist are the heat and the terrain. In the story, it describes all the hills that he has to go up and down, coupled with the horrendous heat beating down on him. The heat also increases the need for hydration, and throughout the story, he was trying to find water, but the water he found was described as ""two hundred degrees and tasted like battery acid."" The lack of potable water made it extraordinarily difficult to bicycle such a long distance in such intense heat, further emphasizing the challenging conditions imposed by the environment on the cyclist."
1526	7508	3	3	The cyclist is affected by many features in the setting. The long hill is one example, slowing his progress significantly. The snake and the dirt road are two more, the former presenting a potential danger and the latter making it harder to maintain speed and balance. The heat of the desert is another, causing him to sweat profusely, and his depleting water supply are all examples of features that affected him, raising concerns about dehydration and endurance. These elements combined to create a challenging environment for the cyclist.
1527	7509	3	3	"There were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. On page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2 there is a sign that states ""rough road ahead."" On page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM4 it says ""over the long, ongoing hill."" He also notes the temperature as stated on page @NUM5, and at the top of page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM7 ""I was traveling in the high desert of California in June."" These conditions of the setting all affect the cyclist, influencing his journey through challenging terrain and a hot climate."
1528	7510	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story. First of all, in the story it says “and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke” (@NUM1). This quote shows that it is extremely hot and it is affecting his riding. The narrator also says, “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”(@CAPS1 @NUM2). This quote is saying that he is dehydrated and is having trouble keeping balance on the rough terrain. The relentless sun and lack of water sources contribute to his physical struggles, making the ride even more challenging. In conclusion, the setting affected the cyclist in this story.
1529	7511	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist by wanting to go longer and riding the bike, eager to see what is up ahead and explore the path. By riding a bike in the heat, one can experience heat stroke and potentially die from dehydration and the heat; therefore, it is important to stay hydrated. That's why you are supposed to have a lot of water with you when you are riding a bike, especially on a hot day, to ensure safety and prevent serious health issues.
1530	7512	3	3	"The cyclist's settings hinder him in the essay ""Rough Road Ahead."" The cyclist is in the desert in the summertime with hardly any water. He is trying to find his way to Yosemite, but he gets lost along the way because some old men gave him bad directions. During this time, he is riding his bicycle for miles and miles in the heat of the summer. His thoughts of thirst get in the way of him trying to continue on to find Yosemite; the sweltering heat and lack of water are constant obstacles. I believe that if the cyclist was in a cooler environment, then things would have been different because his settings were sort of a distraction to him. A milder climate would allow him to focus on navigation rather than survival, making the journey less arduous and more likely to succeed."
1531	7513	3	3	The cyclist became very tired and the area he was in did not help at all. He was in the desert in June, a very hot day, and every town he had come to was abandoned and had no water available. It was also very hilly, with steep inclines that made the cycling work even harder, draining his limited energy and resolve.
1532	7514	3	3	"The features in the setting of ""Rough Road Ahead, Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affect the cyclist because they determine how easy or hard his ride is. For example, the hot land would enable him to die of heat stroke without water; the dry land means he doesn’t have a place to refill his water supply; and the barren land means that if he isn’t stricken by heat stroke, there is a chance he wouldn’t be found and wouldn’t survive. Another example of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist is in the story when the road gets rough and he sees the speed limit sign; his thoughts are about how he is going a water-depleting 12 mph. This shows that the features of the setting, namely the contour of the land and the roughness of the road, make the journey a lot harder on the cyclist. The features of a setting could possibly be the biggest test on a cyclist, and determine whether they have a long, hard journey in which they have to push themselves to the limit, like in this story, or a nice, leisurely ride. Thus, the environment plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience and challenges."
1533	7515	3	3	The cyclist ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî was definatly affected by the setting. He was cycling in California - which is a hot place to begin with - in June - which made it even hotter coming upon a hot desert. When youíre doing a physical activity like that, the last thing you want is to be in the heat. The narrator only brought one bottle of water which at first he was drinking regularly. Then it started to get hot and he was out of water. This affected his body by making him tired, and his mind because he started doubting himself and his ability to complete the ride. Then there was the abandon juice building where they made juice. He said ìIn an ironic twist abandon years earlier had been a Welchís grape juice factory and bottling plant.î He was dying of thirst and then he found the bottling plant, a cruel irony given his desperate need. The cyclist was definatly affected by his surrondings both mental - by saying ìIím going to die.î - and physically by becoming dehydrated, demonstrating the powerful influence of environment on both physical and psychological well-being.
1534	7516	3	3	The cyclist was riding in some rough, dry, and abandoned terrain that made his journey almost fatal. He described it as, ìIn the high deserts of California in June.î It was dry, lifeless, and hot. The sun was beating on him, and he needed to frequently drink water, but he was running out, the canteen feeling lighter with each passing mile. The empty towns were what he was hoping for, a beacon for fresh water, but theyíd been very abandoned, stripped bare by time and circumstance. This made his journey very dangerous. He couldíve fallen off at any time because of heat stroke, the sun a constant threat. He wouldíve died right then and there, another casualty of the harsh landscape. His sweat was drying in the heat, leaving a salty residue, and there was no way for him to cool off in the lifeless desert: lifeless and dry. He had to endure these extreme, ironical conditions for miles on end, just to find some water, the most basic necessity. It was all that a desert is and all that a home shouldnít go through; a relentless test of endurance against a backdrop of desolation. Ultimately, his survival hinged on finding that elusive source of water, a desperate race against the unforgiving environment.
1535	7517	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The hills are too long, draining his stamina. Every town is far apart, increasing the distance between resupplies, and the roads are rough, causing discomfort. The heat also affects him, leading to dehydration. He is affected health-wise due to the challenging terrain and climate. The combination of these elements poses a significant health risk, impacting his overall well-being.
1536	7518	3	3	"When you're doing any sport or anything where you sweat, your setting is everything. If you're sweating in a setting where your body can't cool down effectively or replenish fluids, you can easily get sick. The setting from the story ""Rough Road Ahead"" saw the cyclist with no water and a very hot environment. That's why the cyclist was tired and sick; because he was sweating excessively and had no water to replace the lost fluids, leading to dehydration and exhaustion. That's how the harsh setting significantly affected the cyclist's well-being and performance."
1537	7519	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. The features are old, abandoned towns and hot temperatures, also abandoned buildings. This makes the cyclist think all hope is lost. Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. By the looks of it, it had been a Welch's grape juice factory and bottling plant. I hung my head, that smoky blues tune ""Summertime"" rattling around. Then to a happy mood, as I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them. The oppressive heat and desolation initially crush his spirits, but the unexpected discovery of water, even in a derelict factory, sparks a renewed sense of hope and camaraderie."
1538	7520	3	3	With no one around and a rough road ahead, not to mention dehydration, the cyclist began to feel he was going to die. Because of this, he began to doubt himself, but each time he saw something – a distant tree, a bend in the road, a peculiar rock formation – he tried to get there, focusing all his remaining energy on reaching that next small goal. The cyclist kept pushing forward despite the hardship.
1539	7521	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For one, he was biking through the high deserts of California in June. This caused the cyclist to become overheated and sweaty. So he drank from his water bottles frequently. Unfortunately, since there was ìno one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,î he had nowhere to fill his bottles and become dehydrated. To make matters worse, the terrain changed from flat road to ìshort, rolling hillsî. Normally, this would not cause too much struggle, but since he was dehydrated and overheated, each hill seemed ìcripplingî. The sun beat down relentlessly, intensifying his discomfort. Ultimately, the harsh desert environment transformed what should have been a pleasant ride into a grueling ordeal. My thoughts are that if the setting had been a bit cooler and perhaps on the time period the old men had lived in, the cyclist would have had a much more enjoyable experience.
1540	7522	3	3	"Excitement, desperation, and self-pity are all feelings the cyclist had because of the setting. He was really excited to get to Yosemite park because of its peacefulness. He said, ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite are calling my name."" He wanted to get there because it was so hot; the relentless sun beat down on him. He started getting desperate for water, his throat parched, so he tried a drop or two from this hot water hole. ""I tried a drop or two, tasted like battery acid."" He was running out of water, his supply dwindling with each mile, so he got desperate for some. He started to have self-pity, a wave of despair washing over himself, ""sometimes life can be so cruel,"" he was feeling pity on himself because he had such a long way to go still, the vast distance stretching before him like an endless trial. These are all feelings the cyclist had because of the setting, the harsh environment amplifying his emotional state and testing his resolve."
1541	7523	3	3	"Features of the setting affect the cyclist's moods in many ways. The story says, ""About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first 'town.'"" The cyclist is probably already tired from pedaling for forty miles. Then he finds out that the town is deserted, which makes him a little frustrated and adds to his weariness. The next few stops are also deserted, and he is almost out of water, increasing his anxiety. He is becoming desperate for some sign of life. The road becomes bumpy, jarring him further, and there is a large snake blocking the way, causing him to be terrified. Finally, he reaches a bait shop with cool water, and he is relieved and grateful. As you can see, the cyclist goes through many moods caused by the setting of the story."
1542	7524	3	3	The way the feature of the setting affected the cyclist is that its in June in the middle of the desert. Also he was given wrong information about the location of the next water stop, compounding the dangers of heat exhaustion and dehydration inherent in such an environment. The scorching sun and arid landscape would have dramatically increased his physical exertion, making the inaccurate directions potentially life-threatening, highlighting the crucial impact of the desert environment.
1543	7525	3	3	The cyclist was affected by the climate, the people, and the surrounding. The climate was the desert in June which was very hot with little water. This made him dehydrated and miserable, his energy sapped under the relentless sun. The old men that ìhelpedî him accused him of thinking to be in the guiding situation he was in. There were no surrounding shops or buildings that were inhabited. This way, there was no place for him to get any water or nourishment, leaving him vulnerable and increasingly desperate as he continued through the arid landscape.
1544	7526	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by when the story says “Twenty miles up the road. I came to a fork of sorts,” This statement from the story affected the cyclist because he didn’t know which way to go, creating uncertainty about his route. Another feature that affected the setting is when the story says “I got on my hand and knees, Working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength.” That statement shows that the cyclist was dying for water and he didn’t think any was going to come out, highlighting his desperation and the harshness of the environment. Last feature that affected the cyclist was when the story says “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This shows that the rider had to go under a speed limit but he was earlier tired and he was going way under it and that he could make it up the rough road, which presents a physical challenge despite his fatigue. These setting elements significantly impacted the cyclist's journey.
1545	7527	3	3	The dry, deserted area the cyclist is in, has many cacti.
1546	7528	3	3	In the text, the author was cycling to Yosemite park through a desert which dehydrated him and changed his mood. Going through this desert he ran out of water so he stopped. Some of the towns he was told of which turned out to be deserted, and as he could not find water there he soon became dehydrated. This is the obvious affect the setting had on him, another affect was to cause him to doubt old people and to change his mood from confident to desperate. As he was cycling through the desert, desperately clinging to life in hopes he could find water, he realized that old people know of the past better than the future as they don’t get out to the ever-changing world as much as they used to whereas, at the beginning he was confident in the directions and wisdom of the old men. The setting he was in made him a little more wise, as the harsh reality of the desert stripped away his naive trust and forced him to rely on his own judgment for survival. Ultimately, the desert's impact extended beyond physical discomfort, shaping his perspective and leaving him with a newfound understanding of the limitations of relying solely on the wisdom of elders in a rapidly evolving world.
1547	7529	3	3	Because the setting of the cyclist ride is dry desert it makes the cyclist seem more and more determined. He's is going against the odds so it seems like hes pushing himself to the limit. Against the heat and the long road he's on and having no water all seems lost for the cyclist. But in the end he pulls himself together and makes it happen for himself and triumphs over adversity. The relentless sun beats down, baking the cracked earth around him, yet the cyclist pedals on, each rotation a testament to his unwavering will. Ultimately, his success in such a harsh environment underscores his resilience and indomitable spirit.
1548	7530	3	3	From reading the story, I believe the setting of the desert he was cycling affected him immensely. I believe it affected him in the way his attitude of the cyclist changed for the worst. At first he was very motivated, determined, and hydrated. As time and miles went on the scenery never changed. That can be really hard. In heated weather, you need to be as hydrated as possible, especially if enduring in physical activity. When time went on, he was getting low on water and had nothing to think about other than how much longer, how thirsty he was and is this worth it? It is a lot easier to stay motivated when there is something to look at to keep your mind off the pain. The attitude of the cyclist changed for the worst. In my point of view, I strongly believe that it could have been from working at the same sandy desert for such a long period of time. I have felt similar feelings in exercising while making no progress. It’s hard to see any distinguishing thing. My attitude will go from “I’m so determined to” “I’m bored” to “what’s the point.” But I thought it was great how he never gave up as things got bad. It opened my eyes to see how great it is to reach your own goals. Ultimately, the harsh desert environment played a significant role in testing the cyclist's resolve, yet his perseverance offers a compelling lesson on the importance of striving towards one's objectives.
1549	7531	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by dehydrating him. The cyclist said, ""I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake."" The cyclist was in the desert and each mile he rode he became more and more dehydrated. The desert sun drying out his body. He said with each passing landmark, ""I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" The relentless heat beat down, further exacerbating his thirst and sapping his strength. @CAPS1 that the more he went on the more the desert affected him and dehydrated him, making each rotation of the pedals a monumental effort, highlighting the desert's harsh impact."
1550	7532	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cyclist, encountering unfamiliar terrain, ended up not sticking to his map. Instead of sticking to his map, feeling lost, he had asked a couple of old people for assistance. The old people that gave the cyclist directions also gave him a shortcut to take through the winding backroads. That’s where the second effect came in, where the cyclist started to use a shortcut instead of the main road, hoping to save time and distance. Ultimately, the unfamiliar setting and its inhabitants’ advice led him away from his planned route. That’s how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.
1551	7533	3	3	Some features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the road conditions and road changes with the hills. So far the cyclist had a great ride for about two miles into his journey after that it started to change. This is supported when the author states, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing” (Kurmaskie). Even though the author started this journey out nice it did not take long for things to change against him, as the smooth pavement gave way to a more uneven surface. Although the hills and road conditions changing the character in the story still gets through his problems without much worries. With all of the problems in the setting the cyclist still comes through to end his journey, demonstrating resilience in the face of adversity.
1552	7534	3	3	The features of the setting cause the cyclist two main problems: doubt and dehydration. From the essay, you can infer that the cyclist doubts he will ever make it to Yosemite because of the constant features in the essay that cause him to lose his hope and confidence. For example, near the end of the essay the cyclist is already exhausted and hopeless but then sees a building over a hill. He hurries to the building only to find out that it is an abandoned, run-down factory. After getting his hopes up, he is forced to get back on his bike and carry on. This feature of the setting causes further disappointment to the cyclist and installs more doubt into his mind. Despite losing his confidence and hopes to make it to Yosemite, the features of the setting also cause him a serious, literal problem: dehydration. The weather is hot and he has to carry on over hills and on rough roads. He is running low on water, and at the one town he finds, the water from the pump is undrinkable. The harshness and barrenness of the landscape, therefore, are not just scenic details, but active contributors to his physical and mental struggles, ultimately jeopardizing his health and his journey.
1553	7535	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is the condition of roads, whether they are paved or rough. Another is the heat, which could lead to dehydration. Another is snakes, posing a bite risk. Another is no town insight, making navigation difficult. The final one is lack of info about available resources. @MONTH1 may be the guy made it, or @MONTH1 may be he got hurt on the ride, perhaps due to poor road conditions. Maybe a snake bit him. Either way, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways, influencing both his success and potential dangers.
1554	7536	3	3	"In the essay, the description of the setting was dry, hot, very open, and deserted. The description could suggest loneliness, obviously. Even though the man was all alone and didn't know where he was going, he still persisted, his boots kicking up dust with each step. While he thought about ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,"" a stark contrast to his current surroundings, this thought kept him strong, so he kept trying, pushing onward despite the harsh reality surrounding him."
1555	7537	3	3	There were many land features that affected the cyclist and his trip. First of all, it is a desert, which greatly affects him as there is no water in deserts. The intense heat further exacerbated his thirst. There was also a snake, which could have bit and killed him. Its sudden appearance startled him and added to his stress. As the roads were not very well paved and had obviously been abandoned for years it made cycling much harder for him. The uneven surface slowed his progress considerably. And the juice factory just taunted him, making him remember his need for water, as did the well that did not pump cold water, but instead pumped hot, gross water. These environmental factors combined to make his journey a grueling test of endurance.
1556	7538	3	3	"When the cyclist first starts his journey he is very sure of himself, confident in the tales he'd heard. He sees everything as the old men told him, full of promise. As he travels on, however, he notices everything is abandoned and empty, a stark contrast to the vibrant stories. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. The man started becoming very unsure, the silence and desolation weighing on him. You could tell he says, ""I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get excited."" He was very doubtful he’d get to where he was going, each mile stretching his resolve. In the end, he was very relieved he found a fishing spot with a bathroom and fresh water, a sign that life, and his destination, were still possible."
1557	7539	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in this story a lot. Having unreliable directions, barely enough water for the journey, poor road conditions and other hazards like the heat and animals made this a very difficult journey for the cyclist. Starting the journey the cyclist received bad information on how to get to his destination which led him on a long hard journey with not much water. He says in the story ""The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2"" This means he was running out of water too fast for the amount of land he was covering. Another feature of the setting that affected him was that the road conditions got worse and worse until he reached a highway late in his journey. He said ""flat road was replaced by short rolling hills."" This means the faster, easy, to ride terrain was replaced by slower harder to ride on terrain. These features of the setting could have been very dangerous and maybe fatal and affected the cyclist a lot living this story. The cyclist also had to face scorching heat, and the constant threat of encountering potentially dangerous animals, adding further layers of adversity to his already challenging ride. All these environmental factors, combined with the initial misinformation, transformed what might have been a pleasant ride into a gruelling test of endurance, highlighting just how significantly the setting shaped the cyclist's experience and the overall narrative."
1558	7540	3	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist, because as his surroundings changed he lost hope of making it to Yosemite National Park. Such as when he was riding through his first town and it looked abandoned, with boarded-up windows and an eerie silence, he wasn’t so sure if he should keep going. As well as when he didn’t see anyone or any buildings for miles, just endless stretches of road and desolate landscapes, he got worried and was wanting to lose hope. But as a second road sign appeared, confirming the direction to Yosemite, he was relieved and his spirits lifted. These environmental cues played a significant role in shaping his mindset and influencing his determination to reach his destination.
1559	7541	3	3	The setting in this short story cause the cyclist to doubt his survival. The main problem is water, or lack there of. The cyclist has no water and thinks it’s only a matter of time before he dies from dehydration. Another big problem is the rough terrain, making each mile a grueling test of endurance. The rough terrain is hard for the cyclist to overcome, slowing his progress and draining his energy. Also, there are no buildings, people, or cars in sight to save him, amplifying his sense of isolation. Until he finds the bait shop, a beacon of hope in the desolate landscape, if anything would have happened to him, there would’ve been no one there to help, solidifying the precariousness of his situation and highlighting the harshness of the environment. Ultimately, the unforgiving landscape, combined with the critical lack of water, creates a scenario where the cyclist's survival hangs precariously in the balance.
1560	7542	3	3	The features of the setting of ìDo not exceed posted speed limitî greatly impact the cyclist, in a negative way. For example, when the road changes from smooth and easy to rolling and full of hills, it makes it difficult for him to bike, demanding he use more energy to get over the hills. Another example is when ìtumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.î The tumbleweeds evoke a sense of being deserted and alone, heightening his feelings of despair. Lastly, he sees the Welchís Grape Juice Factory, which is deserted and serves to only make him thirstier, compounding his physical discomfort. The fact that he sees the grape juice factory is also laced with irony, because he is extremely dehydrated and the factory is abandoned, highlighting the cruel disparity between his need and the environment's offering. All of these elements combine to demonstrate how the harsh environment directly undermines the cyclist's already precarious situation.
1561	7543	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. First of these is the blazing heat. He is basically in a desert and he is running low on water. As he starts to run out of water he starts conserving it, which is dehydrating him, so he is becoming weaker. ìI would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Next up is the rough terrain. When you hit rough terrain on a bike it can get hard to keep going, and the cyclist was already short on water ìa large highway sign jumped out at me. I read: rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit sometimes life can be so cruelì. Finally, is the structure. First there was the Ghost town with the ìbattery acidî tasting water. Also, there was the Welchís grape Juice factory and bottling plant which were both probably dimeriling. ìA sandblusted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my headî. As you can see the features of the settings generally affected the cyclist, impacting his physical state, creating mental challenges, and underscoring a sense of desolation.
1562	7544	3	3	The author finds the desolate and harsh settings to be not discouraging, rather they stand out as a cause of amusement and fun, quest-like tests. The author writes that after arriving at his first ghost-town, he chuckles, amused by the funny ìold codgersî and their crazy ideas. When he arrives at the second establishment, and realizes it isnít the least bit established anymore, heís slightly disappointed, but sees it as ìa test of [his] inner spirit.î At the third building an abandoned factory he still appreciates the irony of the situation, acknowledging its past vibrancy compared to its present state. While biking across the desert, he refuses to be discouraged by the empty horizon and instead uses it as a point of reference to work his progress and as a way to push himself, viewing the vastness as a challenge to overcome. Though the author is faced with empty disappointing views, he keeps his spirits up and keeps pushing, showcasing his resilience and ability to find humor and purpose even in the most desolate of landscapes.
1563	7545	3	3	"In the story Rough Road Ahead: do not excess speed limit, the reader sees the scenery and terrain get rougher, and lonelier, and as the cyclist travels and limits are being pushed his outlook is somewhat grim; he only expects the worst. The rough road starts out after a water pump he finds gives him piping hot, brackish water that tasted like battery acid. Water, in a sense, in this story is a metaphor for his life, and is the source for him living. In the beginning he drank it regularly, and when he gets to the pump it is bad, just like when things start to turn sour in the story itself; the initial ease gives way to hardship. The cyclist in this story is very aware of how his body is and acknowledges his dehydration. At one point he says, ""and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke simply because I had listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porches in a decade"" he later said it caused him to laugh sadly, hopelessly; the lack of humans and their technology really broke him down, leaving him vulnerable and questioning his choices. Thus, the cyclist's physical ordeal mirrors a deeper, more existential crisis brought on by isolation and the harsh reality of his surroundings."
1564	7546	3	3	The desert is the crulest of natureís environments. Its lack of water, dry air, and punishing heat are enough to kill even the hardiest creature. When traveling through a desert, one must maintain a constant water supply and know their path with respect to the power of nature. In ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî, cycler Joe Kurmaskie must overcome the desertís heat and lack of water to survive. As the author observes in paragraph @NUM1, ìwide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, I could drop from heatstroke.î If the human body overheats, it becomes sick and unable to properly function, rendering one vulnerable. When in the desert one must keep cool or perish. In @NUM2, Kurmaskie begins to realize the danger of running out of water in the desert, ì I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. ìAs this water starts to run out, Joe suffers from dehydration, despair, and a loss of balance, highlighting the rapid decline one experiences without hydration. Water is essential in a desert environment; without it, as Joe observes, ìthe birds would pick (you) clean, leaving only some expensive out door gearî, a stark reminder of the desert's unforgiving nature. Thus, Kurmaskie's experience underscores the brutal reality that survival in the desert hinges on respecting its power and ensuring a sufficient water supply.
1565	7547	3	3	"The features in the setting of the essay ìRough Road Ahead Do not exeed the Posted Speed limitî affect the cyclist in a cruel manner. The old man says that the towns are going to be there and they are just not functioning towns. To make the cyclist feel hopeless the setting puts him in a California day in June which is extremely hot and puts in all these unexpected twists. A cruel thing to add in the essay was when it read ìThe Speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting 12 mphî This lowers the cyclist's confidence making him seem more worried about his journey. Another cruel thing is the author adding a Welchís Grape Juice factory that had been abandoned with ìA sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring @NUM1 refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,"" totally causing him to lose hope left in the desolate landscape. These features in setting are cruel and contribute to the cyclist's mounting despair."
1566	7548	3	3	The features in the setting, such as the ghost town desert, and the Juice factory, give the cyclist a sense of hopelessness. He is running out of water when he comes to the ghost town, which he thought was an OASIS because the next town was only a short ways down the road. However when he came to the next “town” and attempted to use the water pump, a rather hot, foul liquid came up instead of water, further depleting his already low spirits. He was beginning to lose hope when he came to the Welch’s factory, abandoned and silent under the harsh sun. All hope from him at that point was lost, claiming “the birds will pick me clean.” To the cyclist also that prospect was best, then he was “saved” by a bait shop. These features in the setting gradually emptied his hope little by little, until he came to the Bait shop after which his hope, but certainly not his faith in old men, was returned, showing how the landscape itself contributed to his despair before offering a chance at redemption.
1567	7549	3	3	"In the setting of the essay; ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" had a great affect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through. For example, ""At some point, tumber weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-back the majority of the pavement in front of me, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" The author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to easy on by. The terrain affect the character by keeping him determined. This happens to many people in their sports; difficult conditions often fuel their resolve. For example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game. Ultimately, the cyclist's perseverance demonstrates how adversity can strengthen one's resolve to achieve their goal."
1568	7550	3	3	The sun beat down with merciless intensity. Each step was a labored effort across the seemingly endless expanse of sand and rock. The air shimmered with heat, distorting the already bleak landscape into something almost otherworldly. My throat felt like sandpaper, a constant reminder of the dwindling water in my canteen. Dehydration was a constant threat in this forsaken place, and phones, a lifeline to the outside world, were practically non-existent. Yet, I pressed on, driven by a desperate hope. It was somewhere out here in this desolate place that, as they say, 'the negg down was only @NUM1 down the road.' The heat played tricks on the eyes, making me question every shape on the horizon. Was that a rock formation, or just another mirage conjured by the oppressive heat and my parched mind? It's easy to start questioning reality when the very ground beneath your feet seems to be conspiring against you. It made me doubt myself and what I was doing out here. The shimmering heat made me think that maybe I was just seeing things. But, the more I trekked on, the more it appeared that I was not dreaming. Finally, the more I walked on, the mirage turned into a form. The form turned into the negg down that I was looking for. It was a testament to the power of hope, and the resilience of the human spirit, that I finally saw what I was looking for.
1569	7551	3	3	The many features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. The beauty of nature around him affected him by making him laugh. In the essay, it says, “on a gorgeous day in June caused him to laugh.” This shows, despite what happened, he was might are on a nice day outside giving him an optimistic attitude. Also, the beating sun affected him in a different way. It caused him to sweat and almost die of dehydration. “ growing realization that l could drop from heatstroke ” This shows that he was tensely aware that he could die from the suns might. So, the settings around the cyclist affected him in different ways. Therefore, the cyclist's experience demonstrates how environmental factors can significantly influence one's physical and emotional state.
1570	7552	3	3	In the setting the conditions were brutal. The author experienced searing heat, dehydration, and getting wrong directions that led him miles off course. He experienced depression as his water dwindled and near death when he collapsed under the sun. He had a terrifying encounter with a big old snake as he desperately searched for shade, and at last, he reached his destination, a small oasis. This ordeal profoundly affected him, and he learned the vital importance of bringing a reliable map and not to blindly take directions from well-meaning but perhaps unreliable old people he met along the way.
1571	7553	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it made his ride harder. For example, the weather was extremly hot. ìThe sun was beginning to beat down.î He says it didnít affect him, yet he was very thirsty and dehydrated so internally it affected him, showing the harsh conditions took a toll. Also, the weeds and snakes frightened him. ìtumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.î This could not of made his ride easier, as these unexpected encounters added stress. Next the hills and roads, ìover one long, crippling hill.î This proves how intense his ride was, highlighting the physically demanding terrain. That's how the setting affected the cyclist in ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, shaping his challenging experience.
1572	7554	3	3	The features of the nearby setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. The four main things that affect him are the heat, lack of water, lack of nearby buildings, and DANGEROUS WILDLIFE. For this cyclist one of the biggest problems is the heat. He says “i was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”. this shows that it is quite hot outside by the month stated. June is quite a hot month especially in CALIFORNIA deserts. The second problem is the cyclist lack of water. He says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink some water. When he reaches the end, however he finds water. The third problem is when he needs water, he can’t find anywhere due to the lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find “towns” nearby. Once he finds them, they are either “ghost towns” or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the DANGEROUS WILDLIFE. He says “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake… blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” DANGEROUS WILDLIFE is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all. Truly, the features of the nearby setting are affecting him in a tramatizing way, because so many things like heat, lack of water, buildings, and DANGEROUS WILDLIFE are in his way.
1573	7555	3	3	The settings effects the cyclist because in California it could be really hot sometimes. The cyclist could dehydrate on a long trip and pass out really get hurt, especially under the intense sun. Also there are a lot of hills which could be really hard on the cyclist, requiring significant physical exertion. Therefore, the Californian environment poses considerable challenges for cyclists.
1574	7556	3	3	In the essay, the author added many features that could be picked apart all about the cyclist's journey. One feature was that his water supply was running short. This shows exactly how hot it was and how much he was drinking just to stay alive and continue. Another feature would be the rusty old pipe with the bad water: This shows that the town had been abandoned for years, and the water supply wasn’t up for drinking, adding to the cyclist's desperation. The essay in all shows how hard it is in hot weather with a lack of supplies and no sense of direction, painting a vivid picture of struggle against the elements.
1575	7557	3	3	The cyclist in ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.î had to go through a hard time in the California desert. It was hard for him because it was very hot in the desert in June. That he was almost out of water; at first his ride was easy on flat ground. But when he came to rolling hills he had to use more energy and became increasingly fatigued, making his journey even more difficult.
1576	7558	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was really thirsty and then the dry air with no town nearby made it even worse. The relentless sun beat down, exacerbating his dehydration. There was also the bumpy roads and hills that were tiring and made the cyclist even thirstier. Finally, there was the factory that made him think about juice and made him thirstier yet, the sweet, artificial scent a cruel reminder of his need for refreshment, thus intensifying his discomfort.
1577	7559	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by old people changing the definition of ""don't talk to strangers."" The main character experiences this shift, finding that the older residents, in their eagerness for connection, redefine the boundaries of stranger interaction. This unexpected sociability, influenced by the setting's demographics and perhaps a slower pace of life, impacts the cyclist's journey and highlights the evolving nature of social norms."
1578	7560	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because real cyclists know what the speed is for a bike so you don’t need to tell them, especially considering their own speedometer. If a cyclist needed some directions they would go to a gas station or use their phone, not to some old person’s house. A real cyclist can go as long as they want before the stop because they are tired, gauging their own endurance. A real cyclist knows how to do tricks on a bike and doesn’t have to do them over and over again to be able to do them, relying on their skill. A real cyclist doesn’t have to train just before going into a tournament and expecting to win; they must practice consistently to be able to win. Thus, the cyclist's actions seem unrealistic given what experienced cyclists would typically do in those situations.
1579	7561	3	3	"The setting in the story had a big effect on the cyclist. The hot, deserted surroundings made the cyclist become tired or discouraged. For example the cyclist observes, ""one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corpse that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was trouble."" This quote shows the old, beat-down environment worried him. Also the author says, ""there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" In this quote, the cyclist realizes his isolation, and begins to become more determined to reach his destination. Realize, ever been lost, then you know that it can be discouraging if there's no sign of life around you. All you want to do is keep going and hope you can find your way. This feeling is shown through the cyclist and now the setting around him affects his journey, influencing both his mental state and his resolve to persevere despite the challenges he faces."
1580	7562	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of them is that it was in the daylight, and the sun, beating down relentlessly, bothers the cyclist, likely causing him to squint and sweat. Another one is that because there was nothing around him, he felt frustrated. ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.î This emptiness amplified his sense of isolation. If something were there, even a distant landmark, he wouldnít feel as frustrated, and at least he would have more hope to find something, offering a point of reference and a possible sign of civilization. Thus, the barren environment significantly contributes to the cyclist's mental and physical distress.
1581	7563	3	3	"In the narrative ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected in a deadly negative way by the setting. The cyclist is travelling through “the high deserts of California in June.” It was hot, so hot in fact, that the author realized he could “drop from heatstroke” at any time. This unbearable heat, coupled with the “crippling” hilly terrain was enough to reduce the cyclist to a state of severe dehydration, obviously not exacting a positive effect. The sweltering heat and merciless hills of the setting would not be quite so awful if there had been locations to stop, rest and replenish the cyclist's dwindling water supply. However, “There was no one in sight, not a building, or a structure of any kind.” The cyclist was in complete isolation for over 80 miles of arid desert, the sweating sun beating down upon him as he toiled up steep unyielding hills; clearly the setting was affecting the cyclist in a horribly negative way, pushing him to the very brink of physical collapse."
1582	7564	3	3	When riding a bike for a very long time with no water is bad, but it is even worse when your surroundings offer no aid. For example, when the cyclist has no water and it is a day with nothing around him to help, the situation quickly becomes dire. Also, with no water, he could pass out and get severely dehydrated. When he finds no one to help and nothing around him, he might desperately suck on a pebble to try to keep his mouth hydrated and stimulate saliva production, a temporary and insufficient measure. Therefore, you should always thoroughly check your destination and plan your route on a bike before just going for it, ensuring you have adequate supplies and knowledge of available resources along the way.
1583	7565	3	3	It is very difficult to be outside in heat, let alone advise from old folks and riding a bike. If it feels like it is @NUM1 degrees outside, you don't need to be out there. It doesn't matter how long you are outside for; a heatstroke could come at anybody faster than they can count to @NUM2, so it's best to avoid prolonged exposure in such conditions to ensure your safety and well-being.
1584	7566	3	3	On the way to @CAPS1 the cyclist was riding through dry, hot weather in rough terrain. This was making him tired and dehydrated. Half way throgh his journey he couldn't see anything for miles. That must of been discouraging. All the way there he was dehydrated and when he found water it was @NUM1 degrees @CAPS2 because of the heat. He quickly drank it, hoping it would provide some relief and allow him to complete his journey.
1585	7567	3	3	Hot, bumpy roads, no shade-all are things that affect the cyclist on his journey. He was riding in the countryside and then the sun started beating down on him and he said it felt like the desert, considering it was so hot. The road was fine at first and then he got a while down the road and it really started getting rough and hard to ride on. The part where he has no shade has to suck because he has the sun beating down on him all the time. All are reasons why the cyclist shouldn’t have taken those directions in the first place, as the challenging conditions made his ride incredibly difficult.
1586	7568	3	3	The setting of “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the Speed Limit” significantly affects the cyclist. The words “high deserts of California in June,” from the story, paint a picture of extreme heat and dryness. The cyclist becomes very tired, and the desert lacks readily available water sources, making hydration a life-or-death matter. Adding to the challenge, the cyclist suffers the pain and difficulty of navigating rough terrain. As the sign indicated, a “Rough Road Ahead,” presented constant obstacles. Furthermore, he had to contend with hazards like tumbleweeds and snakes. The dry, rough, and dangerous setting placed the cyclist's life in peril, but because of dedication and perseverance, he ultimately overcame these challenges.
1587	7569	3	3	"The features of the setting in ""Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit"" affected the cyclist. The text states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The flat road that was easy to bike on had changed to many hills that made the cyclist's job a lot harder. This transition from a smooth, level surface to undulating terrain presented a significant physical challenge. The biker was negatively affected by this setting because it contributed to his rough times and caused him to lose hope. The change in landscape increased the difficulty of the ride, ultimately impacting the cyclist's morale."
1588	7570	3	3	In the story ìRough Road Aheadî the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in many ways. One way the cyclist is affected is when they have to cross the hills and plains. The hills make it very hard to pedal when going uphill, forcing them to expend more energy. Another way the cyclist is challenged is when he is almost out of water. They need water to survive, especially during their long bike ride, and the lack of it causes dehydration and weakness. Lastly, the heat the cyclist must endure also affects them. The heat makes it hard to stay focused on making the long journey, leading to exhaustion and potential heatstroke. These environmental factors combine to make the journey a true test of endurance.
1589	7571	3	3	The features effect the setting of the story in a big way. At the beginning of his ride there are people around and he has no troubles. After he talks to the old men and starts on his ride to the @NUM1 town there is no one around, emphasizing the isolation of his journey. There are no buildings in site at all and no source of water. Since there was no one around his confidence of actualy completing the trip begar to go down. Once he arrived at the first town he noticed that it was an old town and no one was there anymore. This made him mad and his confidence dropped a lot. Once he reached the next building he noticed that there was no one there either and then thought hed never make it and that he die. Once he reached the final place it was a more occupied setting, signaling a shift in tone. There were people around. He then began to feel relieved that he could get water. The setting with no one around make him lose a lot of confidence, but the presence of others ultimately restores his hope and highlights the importance of community in overcoming adversity.
1590	7572	3	3	The features of a setting, such as terrain and weather greatly affect the cyclist who is biking in it. The features of a setting can make the cyclists trip either easier or harder. Weather can make them use up their water faster or slower, rain as bad road conditions could force a cyclist go slower. In the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î the cyclist is slowed down and more fatigued because of the features of the setting he was in. The lack of water and settlements slowed him down, as there was nowhere to resupply. Rough roads did as well, jarring him and his bicycle. Hills and animals on the road slowed down the cyclist even more, forcing him to exert extra energy and be cautious. The features of a setting can help or hinder a cyclist, and in the case of the one in ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î the features seriously impared his bike ride.
1591	7573	3	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. If it was a straight road, it would be smooth sailing, allowing him to maintain a steady pace. If the road was bumpy, he'd jump up and down a little, requiring more effort to control the bike. If he was riding in the woods, it would be cool and a little dark, offering a refreshing respite from the sun. If he was riding in the desert, it would be very hot and bright, demanding constant hydration and sun protection. Thus, the environment significantly shapes the cyclist's experience.
1592	7574	3	3	The features of the setting in ìRough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limitî greatly affect the cyclist. Iím sure that the heat makes the cyclist more thirsty, and heat can also drain energy extremely fast. Being in ìthe California desert in the middle of Juneî does not sound like an enjoyable time to be riding a bike. When the cyclist got tired and exhausted from not having any water, Iím sure that riding past all of the empty land had an effect on his attitude. Seeing the barren landscape likely amplified his feelings of isolation and despair. I think that seeing a building made him get excited, and then when he found out that it was nothing more than an abandoned building, his spirits greatly dropped. This false hope, followed by disappointment, would certainly have been demoralizing. He probably felt that he couldnít continue for very much longer simply because all of the buildings he came across were empty, or abandoned, reinforcing the harshness and unforgiving nature of the desert environment. When the cyclist reached the bait store, he probably felt much better, and very relieved to have gotten there before he had a heat stroke, finding solace and renewed hope in what must have seemed like a mirage in the desolate landscape. The setting, therefore, directly shapes the cyclist's physical and emotional state throughout his journey.
1593	7575	3	3	"When the cyclist passed through the old towns the old man told him to, the setting played a big part in making his situation harder to overcome. When he passed through the first abandoned town, the water source was dry and empty; he ""pumped the handle for several minutes but the water would not cool it tasted like battery acid."" The second drink source he passed was on abandoned @PERSON1’s Juice factory, a ""sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth."" These two objects made his situation mentally harder to get through because he was so close to what he needed numerous times, only to have the hope of relief cruelly snatched away, compounding the physical hardship with a psychological blow."
1594	7576	3	3	The cyclist is affected by the change in terrain from flat to hilly, making the ride more strenuous. The elderly men's directions clearly weren't as accurate as he hoped, and most importantly, his growing thirst is a major concern. He tries to save what little water he has left, rationing it carefully for a time when he really needs it. He looks for a place to cool off from the heat and replenish his dwindling water supply, which he finally manages to do in the end, offering him much needed relief. He's also a little bit angry and disappointed in the old men's directions, feeling misled. He's really going a lot more miles than he should be according to the directions and he's beginning to wonder if they've lost it, questioning the reliability of their advice and adding to his frustration.
1595	7577	3	3	There are many different features such as the weather, road condition, and how the person is feeling. The weather can affect if it is raining, which could reduce visibility and make the road slippery. Whether the roads are messed up, he could get a flat tire, delaying his journey. The way that the person is feeling is a big part of whether they try hard or they do not worry about it too much, influencing their overall performance and decision-making. Ultimately, these diverse elements intertwine to shape experiences and outcomes.
1596	7578	3	3	"According to the essay, features of the setting affect the cyclist. If the cyclist is in the middle of a hot desert in June with no water, the cyclist will become excessively thirsty the longer they go. For example, the author states, ""I had been hitting my bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June."" The terrain changes to short, rolling hills from flat land, causing the cyclist to push herself to get to the next town to get water. For instance, she states, ""over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view."" This caused the cyclist to use what they thought of as their last burst of energy to get down there, but the building was abandoned, thus making the cyclist feel let down and highlighting the harshness of the environment. As the cyclist continued on, a setting of a bait store appeared, and the cyclist felt relief because now she could get water, illustrating the direct impact of available resources on her emotional state. These examples show the change of setting on the cyclist’s trip and how it affected her."
1597	7579	3	3	"In the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î a cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. He followed the ëshort cutí that some old men gave him, instead of taking the longer route. These old men had no clue what they were really talking about, so the cyclist ended up taking a path through more obstacles. When the cyclist was in need of more water he ran into ""several rusty pumps."" No water would come out of these pumps so he had no choice but to keep going without water. As he moved forward in his travels he said that the ìFlat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills.î Without any water, he did not have much strength left to face rolling hills, but he had no choice. The cyclist had to go on for miles without seeing anyone or anything. ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" His troubles finally came to an end after getting directions from another man at a fish camp, ultimately concluding his difficult journey."
1598	7580	3	3	The setting adds a sense of urgency. The cyclist is running out of water and he is in the middle of the desert. If he had been in the forest or the suburbs it would not be so grave. He talks about passing out and dying. He exclaims it didn't really matter. He was going to die and the birds were going to pick him clean. The relentless sun beat down, intensifying his thirst and despair, making his situation all the more hopeless.
1599	7581	3	3	In the story, do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist was affected about the road ahead. He took advice that he thought was right but it was wrong, influencing his journey. So it took him off track of the good he was trying to reach, ultimately altering his planned route and potentially delaying his progress.
1600	7582	3	3	The way the settings affect the cyclist is very crucial. First, the cyclist took directions from someone who has not left their porch in decades, relying on outdated and inaccurate information. So once he accepted the directions and used them, problems occurred. One main problem is the cyclist has a lack of water supply, exacerbated by the unexpected length of the journey. Also, the cyclist has encounters with snakes, a direct consequence of being led through less-traveled, wilder terrain. Another issue is the directions were way off, so he had longer to go than he thought, pushing his physical limits. Also, when he arrived from his journey, he found a deserted town, highlighting the isolation and abandonment of the area. So in conclusion, the cyclist uses his own directions from now on, learning a valuable lesson about trusting unreliable sources and the importance of self-reliance.
1601	7583	3	3	"As the setting changes in the story, so does the cyclist’s narrator’s mood. His mood changes from happy and confident to indifferent and scared. At first the cyclist is so happy about Yosemite that he is just care free and no worries at all. He says that, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” Even at his first “ghost town” he just “chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on”. He found the abandoned setting amusing and felt no threat. After this point he could not be so care free. After this town he came to, “One ramshackle shed, several thirsty pumps, and men”. He said, “this was troubling”, it was very hot and he had been drinking his water pretty often. He said that, “He failed on."" He started to get sort of scared; he realized that he could ""drop from a heatstroke."" He was scared that because of his idea to believe the old men he might possibly die. He finally get happy when he reaches the bait shop and he got his drink. From then on he stuck to his map. His attitude changed greatly throughout the story, going from joyful optimism to a state of fear before finally finding relief."
1602	7584	3	3	"In ìRough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the cyclist is affected alot by his surroundings. He is leaving the old water pump for Yosemite. ìNot two miles flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM1.î This shows that as the terrain gets rougher and harder, how much harder it is for the cyclist to go on. The change from flat road to rolling hills immediately increases the physical demand. Also, since he is already getting to the point at which he is getting dehydrated, it is that much harder for the already tired cyclist to go on any further more less make it all the way to Yosemite. That is how the terrain affects the cyclist, presenting a significant challenge to his journey as fatigue and dehydration compound the difficulty of the uphill climbs."
1603	7585	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist by making him very hot. He said he started sucking on stones because he heard that if you suck on stones it makes you not thirsty. He also said he might hit a bump and swallow one of the rocks. He said he wanted to swallow the rocks. The reason for that was that he was so hot, and the coolness of the stones offered a tempting, albeit strange, form of relief. He didn’t even no where he was goin. The heat was disorienting, and his sense of direction had completely evaporated under the scorching sun, further compounding his misery.
1604	7586	3	3	The features of the setting did not help the cyclist on his trip. First of all he was in the desert on a bike! Which helped him dehydrate faster. Secondly, the towns around the way had been abandoned, leaving no place to get more water and no place to ask for directions from anyone. Lastly there were no other people around so if the cyclist was to get into trouble, he wouldn't be able to find help, making this a perilous journey.
1605	7587	3	3	The features of the settings affect the cyclist by many reasons such as dehydration, and the road may cause the bike to stop working. Since there is a lack of water in the desert it seems, the guy could get dehydrated easily, especially with the increased exertion. The intense heat can cause that to happen even faster, exacerbating the issue. The road that he is riding on may cause the tires to pop due to sharp rocks or extreme temperatures. Ultimately, these environmental factors pose significant challenges to the cyclist's well-being and the functionality of their equipment.
1606	7588	3	3	The cyclist was eager to get to Yosemite park; he listened to the ìold timers who havenít left the confines of thier porches since Carter was in officeî. He went the way the old men told him to take. He went down a hill into a town which was empty, into a hard road & snakes in his way, then up a hill, then went down the hill and saw an abanded ìWelchís Grape Juice Factoryî. Then he saw a sign say ìGary And Wilberís FISH CAMP-IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WEíRE YOUR BEST BET!î. So then he runs into the bathroom & drinks from the sink. Before he got there, he was getting thirsty & tired, & when he saw the abanded building, he saw a young boy drinking a juice; he wiped his eyes to see if he wasnít seeing a mirage. So then he sticks a few pebbles into his mouth. It read that sucking on stones help take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. Then he left, then a stone went down his throat. His troubles, thirst, & fear were all behind him when he saw that sign, a beacon of hope in the desolate landscape that promised an end to his parched journey.
1607	7589	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One feature of the setting was the heat. It affected him by getting him dehydrated. For example the text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips I could drop from a heatstroke.” This meant the heat was getting to him, impacting his physical state and highlighting the challenging conditions he faced during the ride.
1608	7590	3	3	"The author made the setting seem long and unbearable, felt of undesirable heat and lack of water at hand. Specially in the way he kept describing the road with all these challenges that kept appearing like after @NUM1 miles to a town then @NUM2 miles passed that he, ìcame to a park of ???. One ramshackly shed, several rusty pumps and a carrol that couldnít hold in the hamest mule greeted me.This sight was troubling.î Then he went in a discharge, ""I was traveling strenght the high deserts of California in June. @CAPS1 You can imagine, the heat, and unbareabalnes of the arduous journey still I face. @CAPS1 That bike seemed endless. Then with a thrust gaining on him for example, ""I was doing a water-deplety 12 mph, sanctures life can seem be cruel."" @CAPS1 He felt his constrain regrate on the journey @CAPS1 I felt his constrain sorrow for his endless journey he had to go through. Another example is, ""I riped the sweat from my eyes to make sure I wasn't a mirage"". Then, reaching this, the building abondoned years ago. @CAPS1 His journey seemed hopeless and long had that make endless with first wave problems getting strength at him @CAPS1 his journey seemed to be harder and filled with little hope as strength left to finish his goals. The author effectively conveys the harshness and despair of the journey through vivid imagery and a relentless focus on the protagonist's physical and emotional struggles."
1609	7591	3	3	In the story, ìDo not exceed postal speed limit,î many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First and most importantly, he is affected by the people who live there. ìNever accept travel advice from a group of old- timers who havenít left the confines of their porch since Carter was in office.î This quote describes the feelings the cyclist has towards the old men. Because he listened to their directions, he traveled through ghost towns and hourly died from dehydration. This ultimately shows how important it is to be wary of advice. Also, the lack of people and civilization affected the author. There was no one around that he could ask for help from. ìÖbut on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. Here, the author is trying to stop for water, but since no one lives in the town any more, he gets none. This isolation emphasizes the desolate nature of his journey. Finally, the lack of water has a huge effect on the cyclist. ìThat smoky blues tune ìSummer timeî rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.î This describes how the author is really dehydrated and he feels like his brain is drying up. However, his need for water makes him more determined than ever to keep going until he reaches another town, or this goal destination of reaching Yosemite National Park, showcasing his resilience in the face of harsh environmental challenges. The setting, therefore, becomes a catalyst for both suffering and the will to persevere.
1610	7592	3	3	The features of the setting affect the man in many ways. One way is that when the man notices the terrain starting to change, he becomes more and more distraught, his anxiety visibly increasing. He sees the sign that says “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit;” it is almost as if he thinks the sign is mocking him, a cruel joke played by fate. Also, when the rider says “In an @CAPS1 twist that should please all sadists…” he is telling the reader that this situation is very ironic and that he was expecting nothing, further highlighting the man's unfortunate circumstances. Thus, the setting and the narrator's commentary amplify the man's feelings of despair and resignation.
1611	7593	3	3	In the story I read the setting is a big factor to the affect of the cyclist for example it talks about how the cyclist sees the sign that says, “Rough road ahead! Do not exceed posted speed limit.” So the cyclist has to be cautious, slowing their pace and tightening their grip on the handlebars as they anticipate the uneven terrain.
1612	7594	3	3	The cyclist was in a horrible, nasty environment for cycling, but the thing that really threw the cycle off was running out of water. There were no houses to refill his bottle or no one around to give him updated directions. The heat made him drink more water and also made it harder to breathe in the extreme heat. Without those faults, the cyclist would have been fine, able to manage the difficult terrain and continue his journey.
1613	7595	3	3	I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he talks about things that he had to endure while he was riding. For example he had no water so he was parched. There was a huge snake that took up half of the road and there wasn't a building in sight. So the setting affected him with doubt, perhaps making him question his journey, but he had confidence of getting where he needed to get; then when he got there it was a sign of relief, signaling the end of his struggle against the harsh environment. That's how the setting affected him and ultimately shaped his experience.
1614	7596	3	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. They affected him physically because of the rough terrain and the heat because he was in a desert and in the mountains. The sun beat down relentlessly, and the rocky paths were unforgiving. Also because he didn’t follow his plan on the map he had no clue where he was and so I think the anxiety of the whole thing took a toll on his physical well being. It affected him mentally because every town he passed through, or every building he passed was deserted and he had no idea where any people were so that had to stress him out. This mentally messed him and he thought he was going to die, thats not good for anyone. I really think he should just do what he thinks is right and not listen to crazy old men anymore. Maps don’t go crazy and they don’t really get outdated, and maps don’t lie to you so he obviously learned his lesson, and hopefully, next time he'll trust his own judgment and navigational tools above unreliable advice.
1615	7597	3	3	Some of the features like the change in landscape affected the cyclist. Differing from flat land to miniature hills to highways is kind of hard to cope with, especially considering he was dehydrated and had no water. The shifting terrain demanded constant adjustments in gear and effort, further depleting his energy reserves and exacerbating his already weakened state due to the lack of hydration.
1616	7598	3	3	"The features of the setting in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” affected the speaker by presenting challenges such as dehydration, dangerous animals, and rough terrain in order to teach him a lesson about following travelling advice from old men. In the essay, he starts out confidently on his journey after dismissing ""their advice,"" reasoning that the men sounded ""no sense of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off town."" The setting changes from cool to dry and barren with the mention of ""tumbleweeds,"" and even changed to dangerous with the appearance of a diamondback snake that blocked his path, underscoring the real peril he faced. In the end, the setting changes back to comfortable, allowing him to learn his lesson through the hardship of the features of the setting and follow his own map from then on, suggesting that experience, not just secondhand advice, is the best guide."
1617	7599	3	3	"The features of the environmental setting is affecting the cyclist. A setting is a certain time and place an event is taking place along with the setting their are features, which is the background description basically giving away additional information about the subject or idea. The features along with the setting are intefering with the cyclist by the hot temperature in Lodi, California making the cyclist or biker hotter than usualier as he heads in the wrong direction closer and nearer to the hot blazen scroaching desert. In addition to this he is running out of water and is beginning to get more and more exhausted from the heat plus he is starting to lose consciousness along with getting dehydrated. This is a major problem for the character because he is losing his sense of direction and because of this he is getting more panickly as his supply of water is running extremely low. A instance of the environmental setting affecting the cyclist is ìI eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweet circled my skirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heartstroke on a gorgeous in June ""(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1)."" @CAPS1 example is ìThis sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June ì(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM2)î. The hotness and heat had also increased the characterís confidence in himself as he was getting more and more panickly. A instance of this is ìI began breaking the ride down into distances. I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it this far, Iíd be fine ì(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1). In conclusion, the hot setting in California had affected the cyclist in a number of ways it had exhasted his water supply and this caused him to become exhausted, dehydrated, and making him lose his logically sense to make decisions however his loss of sense of direction also gave him more self confidence as he stirved to the roads and serves town that was about twenty miles away in order to get water so that he @MONTH1 survive."
1618	7600	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the essay ìRough Road Aheadî by Joe Kurmaskie in many ways. One way the setting affected the cyclist was when it got hot and the rider was running out of water, making the physical challenge of the ride even more intense. Another way the cyclist was affected by the setting was when he said he ""could die of heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because of listened to some gentlemen who hadnít been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh,"" highlighting the disconnect between local advice and the reality of his journey. A third way the cyclist was affected was when he went inside the bait shop and cooled down, offering a brief respite from the harsh conditions. Lastly, when he rehydrated himself, the setting provided the essential resource he needed to continue. So the setting was a main factor to the cyclist in the essay ìRough Road Aheadî by Joe Kurmaskie on his way to Yosemite National Park, influencing his physical state, his reflections, and his ability to persevere."
1619	7601	3	3	The cyclist chose to ride through the worst terrain one can ride through. The cyclist rode through deserts and deserted towns. That's when he started to get thirsty. At first he wasn't tired or thirsty because he was riding by cool trees and rushing water in the morning. The cool air and readily available moisture kept him refreshed. Once he got to the desert part with no water source then he got thirsty and started to drink his water which depleted fast. The lack of a dry place can make you thirsty by itself but after riding a while it became bad. The relentless sun beat down, further exacerbating his thirst. The setting had everything to do on how the cyclist had no water and thought he was going to die from heatstroke. That’s how the setting affected the cyclist, pushing him to the brink of survival due to the harsh environment.
1620	7602	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist’s mood in the story. The cyclist was riding rough terrain and rolling hills. This made the cyclist feel like his journey was hopeless. When the cyclist arrived at the abandoned Old Grape Factory he felt a twist of many emotions. He was extremely thirsty, and there used to be a Coca-Cola build there when the cyclist was at the fork in the road; he thought he could get some water. When this failed, the cyclist was even less determined, and the desolation of the factory amplified his feelings. He felt like the world was against him, and this sense of isolation further diminished his spirits and resolve.
1621	7603	3	3	The settings effected the cyclist, because where ever he went it seem to never end. Like when he was riding along where the old men told him to go, the road stretched endlessly. He went through a ghost town like they said he would, a place of empty buildings baking under the sun. Then he kept on going but it never end and the summer heat started to get to him. Like when he started to dehidade he this old juice factor and started imagening that he was drinking juice. So he started seeing things, mirages shimmering on the horizon, and the unending landscape seemed to mock his exhaustion. The harsh environment, with its oppressive heat and desolate scenery, clearly took its toll, distorting his perception.
1622	7604	3	3	As the author cycles through this shortcut, he is in a very dangerous setting. As said in the poem, he is in the high deserts of California in June. A desert makes the heat unbearable for the cyclist. It's just sun, sand, and him. Then it tells the month; summer, of course, makes the temperatures for the cyclist about @NUM1 almost maybe even hotter. This could cause him to drink plenty of water and almost lose all of his water supply. “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Then there is the distance of his ride. The author is always saying “About @NUM2 miles” or “Twenty miles up the road.” All of this hard work can cause heatstroke and potentially kill him, highlighting the perilous conditions and the very real threat to his survival.
1623	7605	3	3	The features of the setting like the desert, the sun, and abandoned towns affect the cyclist a lot. The dry desert makes him feel as if he were riding forever, and probably makes him wonder if he is ever going to make it to a town, especially with the heat radiating off the sand. The sun makes him even hotter than he already is, makes him sweat more, and makes him even more thirsty, constantly reminding him of his dwindling water supply. The abandoned towns make him lose hope in finding water or even if he is ever going to make it to Yosemite, adding to his growing despair. The mood of this story goes from content to sad to happy. He is content after riding to the first town, but then the rest of the towns are abandoned too and he starts to run out of water, and he thinks he is going to die, which makes it sad. Then, he becomes happy when he finds the bait shop and finds water, relieving his thirst and restoring his hope. Therefore, the setting profoundly shapes the cyclist's physical and emotional state throughout his journey.
1624	7606	3	3	"In ìRough Road Aheadî by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively. The story takes place in June in California. This is a very hot time of the year in such a desert location. The heat adds to the speed at which the cyclist becomes dehydrated, as well as his inability to think as coherently as he could had he not been in a desert in June. The unrelenting sun beats down, further weakening him. The cyclist is also travelling through desolate, uninhabited land. The author says, ìThere was no one in sight, not a building car, or structure of any kind.î This emphasizes the character's total lack of resources. There is nowhere within sight that he can turn to for help, water, food or shelter. The road was also rough, plagued with many rolling, crippling hills. Such terrain is much harder to maneuver, especially in such a state of despair, draining the cyclist's limited energy. The setting of the story, ""Rough Road Ahead"" greatly impacts the cyclist."
1625	7607	3	3	There are a lot of things that affect the cyclist, such as the heat, having no water, the rough roads and the long trip. The cyclist is out in a desert so it is very hot. The narration says, ìand the growing realization that I could die drop from heatstrokeî (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that he or she was very hot and dehydrated. The roads were very rough, for example, ìROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMITî (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The roads became bumpy, and there were a lot of hills the cyclist had to go over. There was no water either, exacerbating the physical strain. So he/she was running out of energy and it made it even harder to continue pedaling. In the end the cyclist survived and drank a lot of water, a testament to their resilience in the face of harsh conditions.
1626	7608	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very harmful way. The hot temperature and boiling sun made the author hot and took his energy away quicker. The emptiness of the setting can make a person lose hope of finding any civilization. The narrator said, ìIt was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you...î(Kurmaskie @NUM1). Adding to this sense of isolation, the lack of any visible landmarks likely compounded his despair. That is not the last of the harmful setting, the dry desert air has the biggest impact on his life. The dry air makes him more thirsty for water he doesnít have making him dehydrate faster. The narrator saids, ìI was traveling through the high deserts of California in Juneî (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Experiencing this heat and dryness with no water further intensified the danger. The lonely and dreadful features of the setting the cyclist was part of made it so much worse that he had no water, ultimately creating a truly perilous situation.
1627	7609	3	3	In ëDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î a cyclist follows some bad advice, which leads him on a tough ride through the desert with little water. The setting has a large effect on the cyclist because it causes him to be dehydrated, which presents the main conflict of the story. ìThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,î the author states when his fresh water supply begins to run out, emphasizing the dwindling resources in the harsh environment. Another factor the setting presents to the cyclist is the extreme heat of the California desert, compounding the problem. This adds to the cyclist thirst and dehydration. The reader can tell it is unpleasantly hot when reading, ìwide rings of dried sweat circled my shirtÖ, that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in JuneÖî, vividly demonstrating the debilitating effects of the heat. The rough roads and challenging terrain also present a challenge to the cyclist that slows his advance to Yosemite, further exacerbating his predicament. Therefore, the unforgiving desert landscape is directly responsible for the cyclist’s central struggle against dehydration and exhaustion.
1628	7610	3	3	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting. The cyclist has been pedaling his bike in the direction that the old men told him to go to get to Yosemite. The sun beats down on the endless asphalt. Soon he is out of water and very tired, his legs burning with each rotation, and he believes he will die soon under the relentless heat. But then, a welcome sight, he finds a fish camp, goes in the bathroom to splash water on his face and revive himself. When he comes out, a weathered man is sitting on the porch. The author gets directions from him and is happy that he is on the right track again, relief washing over him with the confirmation that he had not been cycling in vain.
1629	7611	3	3	There are many affects of the setting in this essay that that can be good and or bad. The setting is alone on a empty mountain road, with no house, no cars, no people. In now going to give you some good and bad effects. One good effect is that you by yourself so while you exercise you can relax and enjoy the energy. One bad thing is that what if you pop a tire or need help. You stock because theirs no one around. Another good thing is that you being by yourself, and there are no cars. You donít have to worry about getting hit so youíll be able to just relax and enjoy the ride . Another bad thing is there is no water so you might want to bring plenty with you; also, there are no bathrooms available. So whatever you decide to do just be careful and think you idea thought before you go, because the isolation of the mountain road presents both opportunities and challenges that must be carefully considered for a safe and enjoyable experience.
1630	7612	3	3	The setting or environment the cyclist was in made him feel isolated from the rest of the world. The vast, empty landscape stretched out before him, amplifying his solitude. He knew there was no turning back once he started his adventure. No one was there to help him, the nearest town miles away. The environment made him realize the many risks involved in this adventure, from potential mechanical failures to sudden weather changes. The knowledge that there is no help was his motive to continue on his long journey, pushing him to rely on his own skills and resilience to see it through.
1631	7613	3	3	"The features of the setting make the cyclist feel hopeless after realizing he is not on a short cut. The cyclist has the ""growing realization that [he] could drop from heatstroke"" as he rides along. Also, the only building he sees for miles ""had been @NUM1 Welch's Grape Juice Factory."" The cyclist is driven deeper into despair and feels that all hope is lost when he sees this building. As he rides on, the song ""'@ORGANIZATION2' rattled around in the dry honeycombs of (his) deteriorating brain."" At this point, the cyclist believes his own death to be inevitable. He says ìwith any luck Iíd hit a bump and lodge one in my throatî when talking about pebbles he placed in his mouth. Finally, the cyclist reaches a small bait shop, and all hope is returned as he ìdrank deeply from the sink.î The desert setting, with its lack of water, shelter, and people was the cause of this mans concern and later panic about his own life. The hopelessness of this cyclist is much like the hopelessness of those in the @ORGANIZATION1, who trapped in a blizzard far from civilization, resorted to eating their dead just to survive. While the @PERSON1 @ORGANIZATION1 went to extremes for their survival, their setting caused them to feel the same hopelessness as the cyclist, showing the powerful impact of environment on the human psyche."
1632	7614	3	3	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting affects the cyclist because he has to cross different types of landmarks. First, he got information from the old people. For example, when he showed the map to the old people, they only knew the old short cuts, not the new ones, leading him astray. Second, when he ran out of water, the environment challenged him further. For instance, when the cyclist ran out of water, he had to climb hills, and that tired him out. Plus, when he tried to get water from that one spigot, only hot water came out. Last, when he finally got to a store, the old guy had a map. For example, when he asked the old guy about the place he was going to, he said I have my own map, suggesting a different, perhaps more challenging, route. So, therefore he knew he was in trouble. In conclusion, this is how the features of the setting affects the cyclist.
1633	7615	3	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist in many ways. The setting was verry hot and there were a lot of hills. The cyclist had been riding up and down hills all day, and the heat combined with the physical exertion took a lot of energy. When he saw the building that he thought could help him he said, ì... last burst of energy, i mane'uvered down the hill,î By saying that it showed that the setting of where he was contained a lot of hills and they effected him by taking up all his energy, forcing him to expend his remaining reserves. That is how the setting had effected the cyclist.
1634	7616	3	3	"In the short story Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. When at the old codgers' house, he is confident in himself, because they have told him of a shortcut to Yosemite, giving him the confidence he needs. As he leaves, he is still confident. These feelings change as the settings change, affecting the mood of the cyclist. After ""about 12 miles into the pedal,"" the cyclist arrives at the first town, he experiences despair because it is a ghost town. Still having confidence, despite the lack of water, he continues on. After a couple more miles, he comes to a small fork with a pump. Thinking it's cool water, he goes and pumps, only to find out it is 1898 and tastes like ""battery acid."" Now he is desperate, with no water, dehydrated, and no towns around. He begins to pedal and pedal, hoping to find a town. When he does find a town with water, the setting is relieving and better for him because he finds water. In the end, the setting affects how the cyclist fluctuates between confident, then desperate as water becomes scarce, then relieved when water is finally found, demonstrating the power of environment on human emotion."
1635	7617	3	3	This would be a hard risk to begin with, but the cyclist is taking it in the desert. As we all know, the desert can get boiling hot, so a bike ride could get unenjoyable quickly, especially with the sun beating down relentlessly. Also, when the only thing you see for miles is road, sand, and an empty factory, your morale can easily drain quickly, and the isolation can become overwhelming. It's just an overall easy setting to get lost in, both physically and mentally, making the challenge even more daunting.
1636	7618	3	3	The effect of cycling is very real and trending because a lot of things can go wrong, like feeling so hot that any water wouldn’t cool you down; it didn’t matter. But when a drop landed in your mouth, it had the flavor of battery acid. He or anyone could just drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June. It was so hot that you are seeing things; even a town hot pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still leave him dehydrated and at risk.
1637	7619	3	3	The features of the setting dramatically affected the cyclist. He started out in a confident mood, until he arrived at a town that was deserted. His confidence was still pretty high but not like it was prior to coming upon the ghost town. Twenty miles up the road after that, he came to a fork in the road which contained a ramshackle shed rusty, unclean pumps, and a small corral. The desert was hot and his lack of water was dehydrating him. Paragraph @NUM1 states, ìThis sight was troublingÖI had been hitting my water bottles regularly, and was traveling through the high deserts in California.î With little water and a short energy supply he was getting tired and dehydrated quickly. The land started turning into rolling hills and caused him to become even more exhausted. His mood had gone from confident to hopeless. He even planned on changing a diary entry in case he died of heatstroke. The features obviously greatly affected the mood of the cyclist. Sometimes disappointment can come from taking the so-called ìeasy way out.î
1638	7620	3	3	"In the story, the setting affected the cyclist all through the story till he arrived at Body and Wilbers Fish Camp. As the man rides his bike, he is off at first, but as he rode into the first town, it seemed to be a ghost town, abandoned and silent. As he pedaled on, ""The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it."" Though the weather is now affecting him, he keeps Yosemite's cool pines and rushing rivers in his head, visualizing relief. He also only had a few tantalizing sips left in his water bottle while going up a big hill, further emphasizing the harsh conditions he was enduring, making his arrival at Body and Wilbers Fish Camp all the more rewarding."
1639	7621	3	3	"The setting of this essay is to tell cyclists where to go without getting them lost and to never take advice from old people. When charting a course, ignore the suggestions offered by anyone past retirement age. Their sense of direction, like their knees, has likely given way to the passage of time. Stick to well-marked routes; a clearly designated bike path is always preferable. Consult a modern map application on your phone, keeping it securely mounted to your handlebars, or invest in a reliable GPS device designed for cycling. Prioritize routes with signage and landmarks. While the local elderly gentleman might insist on a shortcut through ""Farmer McGregor's old pasture,"" resist the urge to deviate from the planned, verified path. Ultimately, trusting technology and official routes over anecdotal wisdom is the surest way to arrive safely at your destination."
1640	7622	3	3	The features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist; the setting was hot and rough terrain, and he was tired and thirsty. The cyclist said, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view.” This means that he needed water so much, and the hill was so big, that finding a building offering respite was a welcome sight. Also, he says, “Summertime ‘rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain’”. It is summertime where he is riding, and to keep his mind off of his thirst, he hums the song “Summertime.” He wants to show that the heat cannot overtake his body. Also, he says, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” He is saying that the terrain is deadly because of the snake that passed by him. He needed to show with all objections, he could overcome anything. As you can see, the setting greatly affected the cyclist, both challenging him physically and mentally as he battled the elements.
1641	7623	3	3	Many things can affect a cyclist. But in the story three main features of the setting affected the cyclist the most. While the cyclist was riding it was very hot. We know this by looking back at the text. It gives us this quote, “That I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” Because it was hot, the cyclist was dealing with the risk of overheating. This could make the cyclist thirsty and dehydrated. Another feature of the setting was the multitude of hills. This would create exhaustion and make the ride more physically demanding. We know their were many hills because in the text it says, “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” Going over all those hills can really tire someone out and test their endurance. A third feature of the setting would be nature. Nature can affect us in many ways, by weather, by terrain, as in this case by animals. In the story the cyclist comes upon a large snake, creating a moment of potential danger and surprise. This making it dangerous and possibly causing the cyclist to feel fear or anxiety. The setting can affect anything, shaping the cyclist’s experience and challenges. It would have been a totally different story if the cyclist had been in the summer during December, not June. Thus, the heat, the hills, and the wildlife all played a significant role in shaping the cyclist’s journey.
1642	7624	3	3	In the essay ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î the setting is used to alter the cyclist’s mood and as a reflection of his situation. For example, the statement ìthe cool pines and rushing river of Yosemite had my name written all over themî helps describe the cyclist’s situation. The idea of lush, cool, water vegetation gives the cyclist hope during his increasingly hellish trip. The beauty of that setting also reflects on the comfort that would come from reaching Yosemite; the good setting equals a good outcome. Later on, the cyclist comes across ìone ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mare.î This is a depressing setting symbolizing a complete loss of hope, and indeed at this point the cyclist becomes troubled by his situation. While pedaling through the desert, the cyclist becomes even more dejected when tumble weeds, which are always a symbol of a deserted area, come by. The use of setting to affect and mirror mood is nothing new. There are many examples of this literary technique throughout history. For example, in his story ìThe Heart of Darkness,î Kurtz was in a desolated land filled with wild beast to symbolize and cause Kurtz to change his personality, surrounded by uncivilized people and creating Kurtz tearing of his clothes and hunt like a dog. The setting of a desert in the uncultured part of colonial simultaneously cause and reflects on this change. The setting in the essay ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî is used as an important tool for character development.
1643	7625	3	3	The features of the essay explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist for many reasons. When the author writes “tumbleweeds crossed my path” it shows that he is most likely in the middle of nowhere. This is true because tumbleweeds are usually signs in movies and t.v. shows that the place is deserted, and the vast emptiness emphasizes the cyclist's isolation. Also, when the author writes “the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” and when he writes “a ridiculously large snake” show the growing danger that he is getting himself into. This is true because the snakes could get a bite any time or he could just collapse from the lack of water and die; these elements highlight the hostile nature of the environment. Lastly, the name of the store is relevant because it is a fish bait store and he is thirsty. This is relevant because fish live in water and he is thirsty and seeing the sign relieves him completely, signifying a potential source of hydration and rescue. Therefore, the features of this essay explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
1644	7626	3	3	The cyclist is faced with many challenges on his journey to Yosemite, one of which is travelling through the California deserts. This was quite a challenge because a desert is very hot and dry, plus the author was riding his bike, making himself more thirsty and hot, and forcing him to ration his water carefully. He also encountered a big snake that appeared to be a diamondback which he avoided even though it almost covered the road, making for a frightening encounter. The author also had to deal with rough terrain when he rode his bike through the hills, slowing his progress. The biker met the challenges and progressed through them with bravery, demonstrating resilience against the harsh conditions.
1645	7627	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Speed limitî this many different settings took its toll on the cyclist. For example in the beginning he started out with a nice smooth ride, but it was very hot. Then he began to get into a hort rolling hills which were taking thier toll on his legs. Then we entered into a rough are where he had to be more careful. The roughness prolly wore him out from all the bumps and bounces. He went through a lot on that bike trip, who know he @MONTH1 have never made at back to where he was staying. The changing terrain and weather conditions certainly presented a significant challenge. It is clear that such a demanding journey would test anyone's physical and mental endurance.
1646	7628	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it harder for him to pedal and complete his ride. For example, ""flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This should make his trip harder because instead of being able to pedal at one consistent rate the whole time, he would have to start pedaling harder and easier over and over again, using more energy. Another example is, ""through the high deserts of California in June."" This makes it harder for him because he has to do all his work in a scorching summer heat, which could lead to exhaustion. Finally, the first three stops he made had nowhere to fill his water bottles, take a drink, or cool off. This would make it hard because he is becoming dehydrated during his whole trip, which can severely impact his performance. These are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist by making his trip harder."
1647	7629	3	3	One feature that affected the cyclist was the rolling hills. The text states, “two miles into the section... I noticed the terrain changing.” The gentle inclines and declines tested the cyclist's stamina, requiring constant gear adjustments to maintain momentum. This undulating landscape presented a physical challenge, demanding both bursts of power on the climbs and controlled descents to conserve energy.
1648	7630	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î the setting affects the story very much for many reasons. First, it is in the summer, so it is very hot, making the physical exertion of cycling even more draining. Also, it is in the desert in the west, so there is a very warm climate already, further intensifying the effects of the heat on the cyclist's endurance. Third, there is not any civilization on the ìshortcutî he follows, so there is no way for the author to get any water to replenish his body with, exacerbating the dangers of dehydration and heatstroke. This confluence of factors demonstrates how the features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist in the story, amplifying the challenges he faces.
1649	7631	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist a lot, because if it was windy too much, it would be hard for the cyclist to control the bike. So if there are a lot of buildings and people outside, there would be a lot of traffic, so they would not be allowed to let the cyclist go there, so the cyclist would have to turn back. Then if it was a clear road and nobody was there and no buildings or houses were there, then it would be an easy ride for the cyclist. So, as you can see, the setting affects the cyclist in many ways, influencing both their safety and the ease with which they can cycle.
1650	7632	3	3	The cyclist was affected majorly by a few dreadful parts of the setting. In the beginning, when it was not as hot and he had plenty of water, the cyclist was absolutely fine, enjoying the ride and the scenery. As the day went on, he felt the heat bearing down on him, making each pedal stroke more difficult. He drank all his water, and now he felt desperate, his throat parched and his energy waning. His mood changed with the setting, shifting from elation to frustration, and he was extremely happy once he reached Gary and @ORGANIZATION1, a welcome sight after his ordeal. Also, this cyclist decided to blame the old men for giving him bad directions when he was in trouble, convinced they had led him astray, but he thanked them once he realized they were correct, understanding dawning on him as he reached his destination. Ultimately, the challenging environment heavily influenced the cyclist's experience, impacting both his physical state and his emotional responses throughout the journey.
1651	7633	3	3	If it’s a good day the cyclist will want to ride. If it is a bad day then they will not want to, but probably will ride anyway, perhaps to maintain their fitness regime or simply to clear their head despite the weather. This demonstrates their dedication.
1652	7634	3	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie's essay, ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting significantly affects the cyclist, particularly through interactions with long-time residents. The essay suggests that seeking advice from these individuals might not be beneficial, implying a disconnect between their experiences and the cyclist's needs. The author humorously states, ""A better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be, 'Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.'"" This highlights how the local setting, populated by those detached from current travel realities, can hinder rather than help the cyclist's journey. Therefore, the setting, characterized by this specific demographic, shapes the cyclist's experience by offering potentially outdated or irrelevant guidance."
1653	7635	3	3	The features for the cyclist in rough road ahead is not the kind I'd want to be in at all. I thought it was going to be a scenery story but it turns out he wasn't that prepared. He took directions from some olden guys who haven't left their house since Carter was in office. He was bike pedaling through the California desert with only the things you can carry because you're on a bike. He ran out of water and could have gotten heatstroke or collapsed in the middle of nowhere with no one around to save him. So the heat gone drive you insane and make you thirsty and you have a bike. The conditions this biker is in are a nightmare, and I don't think he was prepared. Always stick to your gut and prepare for the worst, because this cyclist’s experience shows how quickly a challenging situation can escalate into a life-threatening one.
1654	7636	3	3	In the story the fact that no one was around, there were no buildings, he had no water, and was lost, had a negative affect on the cyclist, he was doubting himself the whole time. Each rotation of the pedals felt heavier, the sun beat down relentlessly, and the vast emptiness amplified his fear. Although he did perserver and made it through the tough situation he was in, his sheer will to survive pushed him forward despite the odds. Therefore, the cyclist's successful navigation of his predicament highlights the power of perseverance in overcoming adversity.
1655	7637	3	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead,"" the setting and its features significantly affect the cyclist. For example, the cyclist mentions, ""I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate."" This suggests harsh conditions contribute to extreme thirst. The setting and features of this story include a hot day in California. Another supportive quote is when the author says, ""I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage."" This clearly indicates a hot environment due to the excessive sweating, and the mention of a potential mirage further reinforces the idea of a hot, possibly desert-like landscape. The harsh conditions of the setting, therefore, directly impact the cyclist's experience and actions."
1656	7638	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. To begin, as the cyclist rode on for the first miles, he did not see anything in sight, just an endless expanse of road. This made him less determined to reach his goal. Then, in paragraph 1, the cyclist saw a building which helped him to gain strength to reach his goal. The cyclist’s determination went down as long as he was riding, facing the monotony and apparent emptiness. But then at last he came to a building that gave him relief and more confidence in himself, showcasing how environmental landmarks can psychologically impact endurance.
1657	7639	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by him dehydrating and running out of time and energy. The heat contributes to these struggles. ""I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" This quote proves the dehydration of the rider. ""The glowing realization that I could die from a heat stroke"" this quote proves the time and energy of the rider is running out due to the oppressive heat. These ideas and quotes show the challenging features of the setting impacting the cyclist's well-being."
1658	7640	3	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead the author takes a trail he had previously heard about. After the ride didn’t turn out to be what he expected it to be, the setting began to “set in.” The aridity of the climate would cause the author to have to struggle against himself and the conditions around him, battling the dry air that sapped his strength. Also his lack of water was a problem to begin with but the scorching sun would make him become dangerously dehydrated, turning a manageable inconvenience into a potentially life-threatening situation. It was clear that the journey would test his limits, both physically and mentally.
1659	7641	3	3	The cyclist runs into some pretty tough challenges. The realities of the setting affected him, because there were so many obstacles that he had to overcome; for example, he got directions from some old men who, though lively, didn’t really know what they were talking about. Then he ran out of water, so he had nothing to drink, and the road started to get bumpy, and he saw snakes slithering across his path. There were no buildings nor cars around, so he had no way of asking anybody for help if needed. He came upon an old factory that was thought to be the Welch’s Grape Juice factory, but it was abandoned and looked like it had been for a while; towards the end, he found a fishing camp where he finally got water and was around people. These different obstacles affected his mood and how determined he was to finish the journey.
1660	7642	3	3	"The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” has a great effect on the main character in the story. In the beginning of the story, he passes the first “town” and continues riding his bike, following the directions some old folks gave him. “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.” His mood at this point was already confident, but this adds to it, with words like “rushing” being encouraging to him. Then, he continues moving on the road. “Not two miles into this section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.” At this point, he is becoming unsure of how good the directions he obtained really were, especially given the increasing difficulty. Once he is already tired, rolling hills isn’t what he wanted to find, so this adds to his doubt. Further along, he said, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" This adds to the despair he was feeling, because he feels he is going to die in Yosemite, as any hope of assistance seems to vanish. Not seeing anyone was probably extremely discouraging, so the setting really affected him. Then he said “over the long crippling hill, a building came into view.” It is at this point that he uses the word “crippling” because he is just about exhausted and can’t go any further, demonstrating how physically and mentally taxing the environment has become for him. The change in the setting directly influences his emotions, from initial confidence to utter despair and exhaustion."
1661	7643	3	3	The features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist. He is riding through this deserted and beaten up town that makes him feel weird, the silence amplifying the decay. After that he starts to ride through the desert when a huge snake gets in his way and scares him even more, its sudden appearance a jolt of primal fear. When he arrives at the abandoned juice factory he is almost completely out of energy and almost can't go on any further in his journey, the oppressive heat and physical exertion taking their toll, until he finally arrives at the bait shop. Most of the features in the setting scare the cyclist but they all affect him, shaping his physical and emotional state throughout his journey.
1662	7644	3	3	The cyclist was beginning to feel that death was coming his way as he continued without a building in sight, just endless road stretching before him. This made him grow hysterical over the situation, yet he still had enough energy to feel sorry for himself, a potent cocktail of despair and self-pity fueling his weary legs. Then, when he finally did see a building shimmering in the distance, he thought it was a mirage, a cruel trick of the heat and exhaustion.
1663	7645	3	3	The location of a cyclistís ride affects the personís attitude and strength. If the road is full of hills, it takes a little more strength to maintain speed. When put in this situation, Kurmaskie writes ìIt was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.î This shows how one gets drained by hills. Also, being in a desert situation can weaken a cyclist due to thirst. The cyclist in the reading was desperate enough to try pump water that looked ìbrackish,î illustrating the lengths one will go to when dehydrated. So, setting can break a cyclist, impacting both physical capabilities and mental state.
1664	7646	3	3	The setting in the passage is working against the cycler. He's running low on water, his throat parched and dry, he's almost dehydrated, making each pedal stroke a monumental effort. The weather where he's at is very, very hot, the sun beating down mercilessly. He can't see a town for miles, just endless stretches of shimmering asphalt and desolate landscape, compounding his desperate situation.
1665	7647	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because it was really hot out, he had very little amount of water, and a long way to go. The temperature was so hot, the cyclist said he felt dehydrated and his energy was quickly draining. He also had to go over a lot of hills and go through deserts to get where he needed to go, making the journey physically taxing. He took a ìshortcutî but it ended up taking longer and he got dehydrated, because the shortcut was more challenging than he anticipated. This is how the setting affected him, ultimately hindering his progress and pushing him to his physical limits.
1666	7648	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a good way. For example, he would be in good shape because cycling is a sport that demands physical fitness. Also, he might be rich because he could win cycling contests and earn prize money. Therefore, a beneficial environment provides the cyclist with opportunities for health and financial success.
1667	7649	3	3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie many obstacles are caused from the diffrent settings. For example, the hot temperature caused the character to get dehydrated. He recalled ì I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. î This caused the loss of determination, which led to him lossing his consciousness. The relentless sun beat down, exacerbating the physical strain. The hills he had to cycle also effected him. They caused him to become tired and weak and to lose his determination, as well. Just like the temperature problem, the loss of determination could eventually make him lose consciousness. He said ì if it looked like i was going to lose consciousness for the last time.î The combined effect of the environment's challenges pushed him to his physical and mental limits, highlighting the significant role setting plays in shaping his experience and endurance.
1668	7650	3	3	The setting of the story had affected the cyclist's abilities because if it was in the suburbs, he could have stopped anywhere and gotten water, but the plot was in the middle of a desert, and all he could do is keep rolling and hoping to find some water. For example, he had to go @NUM1 miles to get to the next town to get water, and if he was not in the desert with hills, he could have made that in no time at all. Thus, the harsh environment significantly impacted his journey and made a simple task much more challenging.
1669	7651	3	3	The cyclist was affected by many features of the setting. The flat road soon became bumpy hills, which were made harder to cycle because of lack of water and energy. The hot desert sun and lack of towns and people also made the journey difficult, as there was no place to restock supplies or find shade. Ultimately, the environment presented several challenges for the cyclist.
1670	7652	3	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is too hot. It is hot enough that his water tastes like battery acid. Then he has to deal with difficult trails because he said “old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” This is saying that the old-timers gave him bad, outdated directions. Plus what made the setting even hotter was he has been cycling nonstop, increasing his exertion in the already oppressive heat. Then when he was riding he said “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.” With him thinking about this ideal escape, it made him temporarily forget about the heat and the arduous conditions. This was why the setting was affecting the cyclist, influencing both his physical discomfort and his mental state.
1671	7653	3	3	There are many reasons as to why the features of the setting affects the cyclist. One reason is because it is so hot, I know this because it was summertime in the California desert, a place known for its intense heat. Another reason is because the road was very rough. I know this because of the sign that he saw that said ìRough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @NUM1). This tells you that the road is very rough. And being that he is on a bike rough roads are not very good for him, making his journey more difficult. Another reason as to why the setting affects the cyclist is that there is no one to get directions from, or any assistance. There is no one around to give him a drink of water. These are few of the many reasons why the setting affects the cyclist, highlighting the challenges he faces due to the harsh environment.
1672	7654	3	3	Yosemite was outside riding her bike in a very hot environment. She is around hills, as she says to herself, “I maneuvered down the hill.” She starts off with no good water. “When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid,” showing the water was bad. Also, the land is very hot because it says, “in the heat of two hundred degrees.” Yosemite starts off struggling but ends up learning to stick to it and never give up. Yosemite’s biggest problem is her lack of water due to the fact that it is hot outside and the water she had was bad, tasting like battery acid; through perseverance, she overcomes this challenge, demonstrating resilience.
1673	7655	3	3	"There are many things that could affect the cyclist. Like when they said, ""tumble weeds crossed my path is a ridiculously large snake."" Her example would be when they said, ""Not two miles into this next section of the ride I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This demonstrates how the changing landscape directly impacts the cyclist's experience. These elements of setting, both animate and inanimate, introduce challenges and shape the cyclist's journey."
1674	7656	3	3	"The story of the cyclist features how the setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist had to go through a lot. ""The speed limit was @NUM1. He was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel."" The cyclist loved to ride their bike; they enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening and the peace it brought to cycling, even amidst the challenges faced."
1675	7657	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, the river and the pine trees, ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,"" provided motivation. Thinking about that helped the cyclist keep going, envisioning the reward at the end. Second, the road was getting harder to travel. ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" and a sign on another road said ""rough road ahead,"" indicating a challenging path. The roads made the cyclist work harder to get to Yosemite National Park, testing his physical endurance. Finally, the cyclist's water supply was running low; ""the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" Not having a lot of water is really bad when you're outside in the heat, and the cyclist had no idea where to find more. The towns the cyclist ran into were abandoned or ""ghost town,"" offering no respite. The cyclist had nowhere to go to get help, increasing the peril of the journey. This cyclist faced many problems during his bike ride to Yosemite National Park, highlighting the difficult conditions he had to overcome to reach his destination."
1676	7658	3	3	The older men gave him directions that were actually really bad. Nature wasn't on his side that's for sure. First of all he ran out of water because of the blazing heat of the sun. Secondly a snake blocked his path, coiled and hissing, and he didn't want to tempt it. Thirdly he became so overheated that it was possible for him to suffer a heat stroke in the middle of nowhere, his head throbbing. Also he kept going to abandoned buildings, their windows like empty eyes. It was so bad that the small pebble relied on for his thirst, to stimulate saliva, got stuck in his throat; he coughed, panicked. He was then lead to a bait shop that was absolutely in the middle of nowhere, a fly- buzzing shack, and he had no way of getting home, stranded and utterly alone.
1677	7659	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist. The dry desert affected the cyclist because there was no water, and the cyclist was dehydrated, making it hard to continue. The strong heat could have caused the cyclist to have a heat stroke, further weakening him. The animals, like the snake, posed a deadly threat, especially since there was no one around to help. In the story it says, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind."" If the cyclist had needed help, then the cyclist could most likely have died due to the isolation. If I was the cyclist, I probably would have given up by then, but I'm glad the cyclist didn't. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the many potential dangers that could have overcome him."
1678	7660	3	3	The features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heat because he was getting lost and he was slowly running out of water. The cyclist said, ìThat you should never accept travel advice from old timers that havenít left their porches since Carter was in officeî. This means that because the cyclist followed their advice he got lost in the desert and was running very low on water. He was so thirsty that he put stones in his mouth to keep him from thinking about water, desperately trying to alleviate the gnawing feeling. In the end the cyclist learned to trust the map and the signs instead of listening to really old people who havenít left their homes in years, realizing the importance of reliable information for navigating unfamiliar environments.
1679	7661	3	3	The setting of the desert is a hard setting to be in with no water or help. If the author would have been on a population trait with water fountain and shade, he would have been fine. But, he was in the desert no one around, hot, dry, no water, and no shade, a truly desolate landscape. îtumbleweeds crossed my pathì (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This described his loneliness because no one was in the desert to help him; he was utterly alone in this harsh environment. The setting could have killed him if it was not for the fish camp, his only hope for survival. The setting had a huge affect on the author, shaping his experience and highlighting his vulnerability.
1680	7662	3	3	The feature in the short story affect the cyclist because with no towns around there is now water. In the story is says, ìThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.î This means the cyclist was short on water and needed to find a town soon. Cycling in the desert and up down hills made it harder and hotter. The heart could cause dehydration or a heatstroke because it says, ìand the growing realization that I could drop from heatstrokeî the buildings the cyclist did see were not any help to him because they had no water. The cyclist was growing desperate. Eventually he came to a fishing camp and found water in the sink of the bathroom. The story says, ìI stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.î This is where the setting changes because the cyclist found cool water finally. This illustrates how crucial the presence or absence of essential resources can be when navigating challenging environments, and the eventual relief found at the fishing camp underscores this point.
1681	7663	3	3	"In ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî, the author faces many obstacles because of the different terrain changes on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Taking advice from a group of old men at a gas station, he headed to his first stop. The old men said he would see a town but what he really saw was a sort of ruined ""ghost"" town, devoid of life. Then he came to a fork in the road and was running out of water, his throat parched. He had been riding on flat road when the terrain dramatically changed. It became hilly and very inconsistent, a jarring shift from the smooth path. This sudden change in terrain caused him to get more tired, thirsty, and hot under the relentless sun. The cyclist then came to a huge hill and, summoning his last bit of energy, rode down, the descent offering momentary relief. He was exhausted, his body aching. All the terrain changes not only changed the cyclistís physical state, but his mood and determination as well, testing his resolve with each new challenge."
1682	7664	3	3	"The setting affect the cyclist in many ways. ""The journey nass make an snake this quote and that there made it seem like he is in the middle of know were and is ulcoming no plass because the man on the pourch said it would not be to far. The first town also was empty and when saw the town he was excited to go and feel a little out when he got closer he realized that the town has been abandoned this whole time so he was forced to keep going out the empty town made him feel almost hopless. In his attempts to make it to that next town, that how the setting mos affected the cyclist in the way that it did, impacting his emotions and resolve as he continued his difficult journey."
1683	7665	3	3	The setting of the road affected the cyclist in many different ways. Because there were no towns on the road it made it very difficult for him to find water which led him into a dehydrated state. ìThe old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so. The rolling hills of the road were making him use more energy, draining his reserves faster than he anticipated. Because there were no buildings for miles he broke the ride into short distances, mentally marking each mile marker as a small victory, and this helped him cope with the isolation and physical challenge. This made the journey more manageable despite the harsh conditions.
1684	7666	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in so many ways. The lack of water was the biggest problem he had, as the arid landscape offered him no respite. The group of old guys that gave him directions weren't a big help at all. The men gave the cyclist directions based on what they remembered when they were younger. The cyclist knew not to take directions from the old men, but they seemed so sure about what they were talking about to him that he momentarily doubted himself. The cyclist first had determination to get to his destination. As he began to get hotter and more thirsty, his resolve started giving way to thoughts of giving up. As soon as he was about to give up his troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind him now. He stumbled across water, a testament to his perseverance against the harsh environment.
1685	7667	3	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One way is he is found stuck with only a little bit of water. ìThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,î (Kurmaskie). Also the cyclist was lost because of the old men directions that got him nowhere because their directions were out of date. ìNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who havenít left the confine of their porches since carter was in office,î (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He was giving bad directions and wasnt too pleased with his predicament. Therefore the cyclist went through some tough times due to both the scarce water and the unhelpful, outdated guidance, compounding his difficulties.
1686	7668	3	3	Different features of the settings affect the cyclist. The setting of the story, which is based in the desert, has a negative affect on the character. The desert land is baron, leaving him only with his small supply of water. During his journey he runs out of water, causing him to lose contact with reality and suffer from dehydration. The extreme heat in the desert causes him to begin to hallucinate vividly. The cyclist begins to see a grape juice factory, which interrupts his trip and offers false hope. To his dismay, it turns out to be no more than a mirage, highlighting the harshness of his environment. The lengthy road also affected the trip. The length and roughness of the road had worn the cyclist down physically and mentally, contributing to his weakened state and the challenges he faced. Ultimately, the desert's unforgiving features significantly hindered the cyclist's journey.
1687	7669	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thinks after a nice afternoon in a nice campground a shortcut to his next destination would be very nice. He thinks the shortcut will be a nice way to relax than to take the original longer way to Yosemite. But the trip he makes changes his mind a lot. In the essay the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him. He says, ìThe old guys had sworn the next town only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. I would conserve my waterÖî He did conserve his water, carefully rationing each sip, but the town was very old and didnít have any water for him to drink. So throughout the essay the narrator went without water until he got to a factory, got some water to drink, and got new directions. The desolate landscape and lack of resources greatly impacted his journey. The trip was very different from what he had expected, proving far more challenging and less relaxing. It was more depressing than the peaceful ride he had envisioned.
1688	7670	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because the features of the setting were based on something else. This would affect the cyclist because there are differences in the stories, meaning the cyclist's experience would be altered by the specific characteristics present in this alternate setting. The cyclist's actions and reactions would necessarily be shaped by the unique conditions of this newly defined environment, influencing their journey and ultimately changing the cyclist's overall experience.
1689	7671	3	3	You can always choose your features because your ideas might change over time. This flexibility allows for adaptation and refinement as your understanding evolves. Being open to modifying features ensures that your work remains relevant and aligned with your current perspective, ultimately leading to a more robust and well-considered outcome. Therefore, adaptability in feature selection is key to accommodating evolving ideas.
1690	7672	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist mentally, physically, positively and negatively. For instance, ""had been do @CAPS1's Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant. A sandblasted picture of a young boy by pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still been seen."" This affected the author mentally, making him remember he had no water. Which in turn affected him physically by becoming dehydrated as moments passed. So overall that setting features had a negative direction affect on the cyclist. Another example, ""One ramshacked shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling."" This affected the cyclist mentally by making him think he was never going to see civilization again. It also affected him physically because the water tasted like ""battery acid"" which put him deeper into his dehydration state. These setting features had a negative affect on the cyclist. The setting features and how they affected the cyclist is like an environment a person is advised in and how it makes them who they are."
1691	7673	3	3	He is going on a journey on his bike. He has to go down hills, the wind whipping past his face as he grips the handlebars tightly. He also has to deal with the fact that he has no water, his throat already feeling parched under the relentless sun. That's basically what the setting is about, a test of endurance against the elements and the challenging terrain. This lack of water will surely test his resolve as he continues his ride.
1692	7674	3	3	When riding a bike the features around you can affect the cyclist. Some things that can affect the cyclist are weather and scenery. If the weather is cold and rainy the cyclist would not want to be riding. The dangers of riding when the weather conditions are bad will make the cyclist second guess riding or not. If the weather is extremely hot the cyclist will get dehydrated quicker and even more exhausted. The scenery can also affect the cyclist. When a cyclist is riding and all he/she sees is a desert then they might have doubts on where they are going. If there are abandoned buildings everywhere the cyclist might become frightened and want to head back or lose hope, as shown in the story “Do not exceed the speed limit” when he gets over a hill and begins to think that he will never make it to Yosemite. Ultimately, both environmental conditions and the surrounding landscape can significantly impact a cyclist's experience, influencing their physical state and mental resolve.
1693	7675	3	3	"The features of the setting exhuberate the cyclist. The June weather added to the water depletion, being the beginning of summer, when the cyclist arrived at the first ""town,"" it was deserted, and the water had a disgusting taste. The author uses verbal irony when calling it a ""town,"" having it not really be a town anymore, only ruins. The large snake presented an air of danger and the dilapidated, abandoned Grape Juice Factory added to the hopeless, lost tone, emphasizing the cyclist's isolation and the desolation of the landscape. The setting thus amplifies the cyclist's struggle and underscores the bleakness of the journey."
1694	7676	3	3	Many things in the setting affect the cyclist. The first thing that affects him is the heat. The heat is actually what causes the conflict in the story of the cyclist needing water. If the heat was not present in the story than the cyclist would not have such a need for water and he would be able to continue on his ride without fear of dehydration. Another aspect of the setting that affects the cyclist are the rolling hills. These hills also exhaust the cyclist and cause him to need more water. If these hills were gone than the cyclist would have tired less quickly making his journey easier. The presence of the sun beating down on the cyclist also contributes to his discomfort and increased thirst. Ultimately, the setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist.
1695	7677	3	3	"The features of the setting in, ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" affect the cyclist in many ways. After following the old mens' advice he sets off on his journey. After the first town appears the sun really starts to beat down which really affects the cyclist. In the essay it says “The sun was beginning to heat beat down, but I barely noticed it.” He might have not noticed it yet but then later on the long winding road on the new flat terrain he runs out of water and that is real dangerous in weather that hot. The text says, “The speed limit was 65. I was doing a water- depleting 10.” In this part of the story it proves that the cyclist is out of water. In this kind of setting you can run into dangerous creatures. In the story it says, “I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” This entry proves to the reader that there are snakes in this sort of setting. The cyclist faces challenges like dehydration and encounters with wildlife, which highlight the significant impact of the setting on his journey. The features of the setting in “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” affects the cyclist greatly."
1696	7678	3	3	The terrain setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The fact that he was in a desert made him thirsty; the relentless sun beat down, evaporating any moisture. There were no towns or any sign of water to quench his thirst, and the dry air rasped in his throat. The hills he would have to depend on his heart to cycle town just made him more tired, each incline a further drain on his dwindling energy reserves. These are what the setting did to the cyclist, highlighting how environment can significantly impact physical endurance and overall well-being.
1697	7679	3	3	In the story ìDo not exceed posted speedî by @PERSON1, the cyclist faces problems caused by the setting. The biker was riding and the heat was scourching and the biker was really getting dehydrated and tired and he was running out of water. Because it was so hot the biker had to drink more water to replenish his body of all the sweat he was loosing while biking. The hills of the terrain were making it harder on the biker by making him us more energy and liquid to keep going. The sun beat down relentlessly, adding to his discomfort. If it had been cool and breezy he would have had no problem making that distance. If the surrounding area was full of people and not abandoned towns than he would have had water to drink. The desolate landscape offered no respite, exacerbating his predicament. Ultimately, the unforgiving environment significantly contributed to the cyclist's struggles.
1698	7680	3	3	"Every body experiences physical and emotional pain, but most probably wouldn't have survived what the cyclist in this story went through. The man started a bike ride in Yosemite National Park, but when some elderly men told him a short cut, his adventure had just begun. First of all, every ""town"" and ""building"" the men told him he would come to, wound up being completely deserted. At first this wasn't a big deal to the cyclist. In the fourth paragraph when he came to his first deserted town he, ""chuckled, checked [his] water supply, and moved on."" As his journey progressed, his water decreased. He was then in desperation for a town. On top of that, in the story he wrote, ''the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This made his biking harder and he was then becoming dehydrated. He finally found a town with water, but learned his lesson from taking advice from strangers and old men, understanding that sometimes, shortcuts lead to unexpected and difficult journeys."
1699	7681	3	3	"The features of the setting would have affected the cyclist a lot. There is a man who takes the advice of old men and takes a “shortcut” to Yosemite Park. The shortcut only leads him to thirst, and no park. The narration states, “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen (Kurmaskie @NUM1)."" This feature could affect the cyclist by discouraging him, as the stark contrast between the image of refreshing relief and his own parched reality is a cruel reminder of his situation. The cyclist comes to the first “town” but only finds yet again no water, and a picture of something that makes him more thirsty. It could also make him be more angry at the old men because they led him on this pointless journey, further fueling his frustration. Another feature that would affect the cyclist is the lack of trees or shade. The only thing he could feel was the sun beating down on his back. The narration states, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.(Kurmaskie @NUM1).” This physical discomfort, amplified by the relentless sun, also makes the cyclist believe that old men do not know what they are talking about, solidifying his distrust and regret for following their ill-fated advice."
1700	7682	3	3	"There are many features of the setting that affected the cyclist in ""Do not exceed the posted speed limit."" The time of year affected the cyclist because it's mid-June, and the region affected the cyclist because mid-June in Arizona is extremely hot and dry. If it was in a more northern state, it wouldn't be as bad and you would not have the same level of heat. When the terrain changed from flat to hills this affected him because it made it harder for him to ride uphill and expend even more energy. These are some features of the setting that affected the cyclist in ""Do not exceed the posted speed limit."""
1701	7683	3	3	In *Rough Road Ahead* by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist. Because he was in the California desert in June, his water supply was depleted, and he came across a ghost town, a stark reminder of nature's harshness. His hope was dwindling due to this desolation. He found a water pump, but it produced only a tar-like substance; as a result, the punishing desert and the lack of potable water made him wish he was dead. He decided never to take advice from strangers again and to trust his map instead, recognizing its guidance as more reliable than fleeting encounters. That is how the harsh features of the setting directly impacted his physical state, his mental resolve, and his decision-making.
1702	7684	3	3	In the essay, ìRough Road A head Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First of all, he was traveling in the desert which means it was very dry. This meant that the cyclist could not refill his water and was slowly getting dehydrated. Also, the cyclist was biking in the heat. This meant that he was continuesly sweating which also depleted his water from his body and played tricks on his mind. Finally the hills caused him to exact more energy furthermore making him more and more dehydrated. The hills also put a damper on his spirits, which made him have to muster a lot of inner strength and determination to keep going. This part of the setting affected him emotionally. Overall the setting had a physical and emotion effect on him.
1703	7685	3	3	The cyclist is alone, traveling on flat land at first, following the direction in which the old men told him to get to Yosemite National Park in @LOCATION1. During his travels, he becomes dehydrated cycling over hills and deserts with the sun beating down on him in the hot June weather; he realizes he could get a heart stroke without water. His travels are desolate and lonely, and when he finally sees buildings, which are really ghost towns, he recovers and finds some determination to speed up. The cyclist luckily found a camp site to save him from passing out in the desert where he could rest, get water, then carry on his journey using his own map, ensuring he could reach his destination.
1704	7686	3	3	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed Limit,” the cyclist is trying to get to Yosemite with directions that some codgers, or eccentric old men, gave him. The cyclist said the old men looked as though they “haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” Well, he takes their advice, and he gets lost about @NUM1 along on his journey. While looking forward to the “Cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,” he was traveling through a barren desert. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This type of setting could really bring down a cyclist's mood while thinking of Yosemite. It could make him lose all hope of ever finding Yosemite at this rate. If you have a nice setting, it makes the trip worthwhile, and your ending point even better, but the bleakness of the desert only serves to amplify the cyclist’s despair and frustration, making the prospect of reaching the desired destination seem increasingly remote.
1705	7687	3	3	The setting effected the performence of the cyclist and the mood of the cyclist. The rolling hills the cyclist had to get over most likely made him more tired and thirsty because he had to put more effort in to get over them. ìover one long, crippiling hill, a building came into view.î The long, big hills that he had to go up made him more thirsty, but probably more satisfied when it was all over. Ironically, the building was a grape juice factory; abandoned and rusty, but the sigh featuring a boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice was still noticeable. This brought his hopes down somewhat. But he continued to move on regardless. In my life, I have never had such an experience to where I had to keep pushing and urging myself to my goal, but the closes I got, the more distractions got in the way to try and stop me, making the journey more challenging.
1706	7688	3	3	ìDo not exceed posted speed limitî, is a short story about a man who is bicycling through Yosemite and he asks some elderly men for direction and they lead him in this ìoldî shortcut that takes him through tough terrain and extreme famine. The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways throughout the story, for example, when the bicyclist came to a deserted area he said ìthere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kindî. By this time, he was malnourished and in need of water; this extreme thirst also resulted in him passing an abandoned Welchís grape juice factory with an advertisement with a young boy pouring a fresh glass of juice in his mouth. He says ìIn an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building,î then he goes into detail about the building; this mood and feeling by this time was tired and worn out, and the advertisement didnít help the situation at all. The author's mood did change with the setting, and before it got better it was worse, showing how the harsh environment intensified his physical and emotional struggles.
1707	7689	3	3	"The young cyclist began his day confident, looking forward to his day of riding across California. Slowly, however, as he recognizes he's been directed wrongly, his mood changes, & he begins to feel more hopeless. As he begins, he feels carefree & ready for anything. He writes, ""I checked, checked my water supply & moved on."" The sun was beginning to beat down, but he barely noticed it. The surroundings have little effect on him. Later on, he realizes his water was going down, & he is getting tired; his mood changed to exhaustion & defeat. Here he writes, ""I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles & stuck them in my mouth; with any luck, I'd hit a bump or lodge one in my throat."" He has become sarcastic and saddened by the hopelessness of his journey. Eventually, the relief of the cold water helps to bring up his spirits & sense of humor, reminding him that even in adversity, resilience and a bit of levity can help one to carry on."
1708	7690	3	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the beginning, the setting was at the old man's place, and the cyclist was happy and confident, enjoying the comfort and hospitality offered. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water, the harsh, desolate environment made him upset and frustrated, as his basic needs were unmet. When he saw the building, a glimmer of hope arose, and he was relieved, thinking his troubles were over. But when he found out it was abandoned, the dilapidated structure dashed his hopes, and he was sad, facing further hardship. When he finally reached the store, a beacon of civilization, he was excited and relieved, his journey nearing a successful conclusion. That is how the setting, with its varying conditions and offerings, directly affected the cyclist's emotional state and overall experience during his trip.
1709	7691	3	3	Weather, places, the will to continue – all are reasons that explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, the weather will affect the cyclist because in hot weather you lose a lot of water and you sweat a lot, making it hard to pedal and easier to become dehydrated. The sunny, hot weather will affect his will to ride, potentially leading to exhaustion and discouragement. I mean come on, who wants to ride when it's burning hot outside? The places the cyclist went through, like towns with stop-and-go traffic and rough, unpaved roads, would also affect him because it’s pretty tough to maintain momentum and comfortable riding conditions on varied and challenging terrain. These environmental factors significantly impact a cyclist's physical and mental state, ultimately influencing their ability to persevere.
1710	7692	3	3	The story “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted, speed limit” tells of a biking trip gone wrong, but the story would not be as terrifying if it had happened in a different place, as the setting plays a large role. The story begins on a pleasant summer evening, but as the man bikes, he arrives at a ghost town devoid of all life. Later, feelings of unease set in when he arrives at “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule.” Then, panic sets in as the terrain becomes hilly, and tumbleweeds and snakes cross the path, like a cold western. Finally, all hope seems lost when he reaches the grape juice factory and finds “a sand blasted picture of a young boy.” The desolate and increasingly ominous setting is a powerful tool that greatly influences the cyclist's growing fear and sense of isolation, ultimately amplifying the story's terrifying effect.
1711	7693	3	3	"In the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the cyclist's physical abilities. The features affected his abilities because the climate and dangerous environment were hot and rough to handle. These features were hot and rough since he was in the California deserts in June. The passage that supports this is, “Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamondback- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” Also, the features of the setting give him determination. They give him determination because each horizon he sees gives him hope. They give him hope since he knows he is that much closer to Yosemite National Park. The passage that supports this is when he notes the “distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could move it that far, I’d be fine.” In the story, ""Rough Road Ahead, Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of his setting affect both the cyclist's physical and mental abilities, showing how environment can impact both the body and mind during a challenging journey."
1712	7694	3	3	"The features of the setting have a huge effect on the cyclist. There was a point in the story where he ran out of water and he remembered that the old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. He was tired and dehydrated but he thought he could make it along the road. So he started off and then two miles later the terrain changed and so did his outlook on this entire journey. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. ""Sometimes life can be so cruel."" These hills took a lot out of him and he was now on a highway. Before this terrain change the rider is very positive and thinks he can do this easily. ""I could make that!"" But after the terrain change he loses hope and almost doesn't make it. ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" It is obvious as you read that when the terrain becomes tough it has a huge negative effect on the cyclist, showing how the environment dramatically shaped his mental state and his physical endurance."
1713	7695	3	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in a few ways. The roads were nice and smooth then turned to hills, increasing the exertion required. It was a hot day in June, and he had a sparse water supply with him, making the heat more dangerous. He was peddling through the deserts of California, exposing him to intense sun. The last thing that effected him was that there weren't very many places to stop for water, exacerbating the dehydration risk. These environmental factors combined to create a challenging and potentially dangerous situation for the cyclist, demanding careful resource management and endurance.
1714	7696	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is on his way trying to find his way to Yosemite National Park, but runs into a little trouble when getting directions from a couple of older men. The one lesson the cyclist learned was to never to listen to short-cuts given to you by old men who are extremly out of date and havenít left their pourch since Carter was in office. The cyclist learned this the hard way when he ends up lost and almost died of thirst. The setting takes place in the desert of California or in deserted ghost towns. One his journey the cyclist says ìÖI was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.î This feature effects the cyclist because of the extremely dry heat beating down on him makes him dehydrated. Also along his journey the cyclist encounters hills. The feature of the setting effects the cyclist by tiring him out and making him believe there isnít any hope of him getting out alive. Features of the setting like hills and deserts dehydrates and exhausts the cyclist, contributing to his near-death experience and highlighting the importance of reliable navigation.
1715	7697	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. It seems to be the more desperate the situation, the more determined she becomes. Pg @NUM1 (""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean""). Right after he thinks this, he climbed away for the abandoned factory of Juices and dreams. He says pg @NUM1 ""troubles, thirst, and pain were all behind me,"" this shows that after a dire situation, the narrator feels relieved of all earthly obligations. Not only does the setting affect the cyclist but the entire story around him, shaping his internal state and driving his actions forward."
1716	7698	3	3	The setting of the story is very dry and humid, and flat, and hilly. The author noticed the terrain changing, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Joe Kurmaskie). Being out in the middle of a desert-like surrounding during June, and nothing surrounding him is a scary thought. The heat and lack of water affect him, by him possibly getting mirages, or he might faint because of the heat and how much fluid he has lost. The hills don’t help any either, making the journey more arduous and increasing the risk of dehydration. This harsh environment, combined with the physical strain, creates a truly daunting and frightening experience.
1717	7699	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is riding through the desert in the middle of June yet he has very little water. This affects him because he is thirsty but he doesn't have a lot of water to drink and he is in a desert in the middle of June, which makes it very hot and causes him to sweat, further depleting his limited water supply. Also in the story it says he comes to Welch's Grape Juice Factory where on the side of the building he sees a picture of a ""young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth."" This makes the cyclist even thirstier, heightening his awareness of his parched state as he continues on to find water at a bait shop, illustrating how the environment exacerbates his physical discomfort and intensifies his need."
1718	7700	3	3	The cyclist in this essay is trying to go to Yosemite National Park. He feels confident in him making it, not realizing what is up ahead. First comes the windy roads. As he goes along his confidence starts to wither away. The desert hits him like a boulder because he is running short on water and needs to rest. The extreme heat just makes everything worse. ìNot the mile into this heat section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. ìThis shows that the cyclist did not expect to meet this kind of terrain and is overwhelmed by it. The one thing he never does is give up. This is important because as he went along, just before giving up, he found a place to get water and to relax. ìThen, as easily as running about, my troubles thirst, and nor were all behind meî This shows that he was strong and determined to survive and he finally found what he needed and it made happy and have a will to live. Everyone in life needs to be determined. The cyclist's journey highlights the unpredictable nature of challenges and the importance of perseverance. Ultimately, his determination allowed him to overcome adversity and continue toward his goal, demonstrating the power of resilience.
1719	7701	3	3	It gave him a hard time, so he learned a lot of things from that experience. He now knows that it's not always easy. It's not a big problem, but sometimes some small problems become bigger. Life is like riding a bike; you have your downs, sometimes have problems, and sometimes get lost, but that is life and how we grow from our experiences.
1720	7702	3	3	The features of the setting very much affect the cyclist. He had to ride through tough conditions and became very exhausted. I believe the toughest feature of the setting was the heat. He told us, ìI was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.î He was talking about how he needed to sip from his water more than normally. Another tough feature of the setting was the hills he had to ride up and down. As he was riding he said, ìFlat road was replace by short, rolling hills.î I believe riding over these hills in the hot June weather in a California desert was a very tough task for the cyclist. I believe the terrain very much affected him, and the combined effect of the heat and hills greatly contributed to his exhaustion.
1721	7703	3	3	The features of the setting in this story make the ride more difficult for the cyclist. For example, the cyclist is moving through the ìÖ high deserts of CaliforniaÖ ì (kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the cyclist is at a high altitude, which makes breathing more difficult. Then the cyclist notes that the ìFlat road was replaced by short rolling hills ì (Kurmaskie @NUM1 ). The hills would make the trip more difficult. This is evidenced by the cyclist describing one of them as a ìÖ long, crippling hillÖ ì (Kurmaskie @NUM1 ). Clearly, the terrain, which got increasingly difficult, negatively affected the cyclist, adding physical strain and mental discouragement to the journey.
1722	7704	3	3	"In the story, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, the condition of the road was bad, changing from flat road to short, rolling roads. Tumble weeds crossed his path, further complicating his journey. He had a lack of water, and the water he did have tasted like battery acid, offering little relief. In the story it says, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,"" revealing the physical toll the harsh environment exacted. These details emphasize how the unforgiving landscape significantly impacted the cyclist's experience, challenging his endurance and resolve."
1723	7705	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist like if you have to go uphill or along long bumpy type roads. Then in the essay it says ìRough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit: @CAPS1 does make things more difficult than average. Especially with a lack of water to make things worse, the rider's energy will deplete faster, and the journey becomes more challenging. Thus, the combination of a difficult route and dehydration can significantly impact the cyclist's performance and overall experience.
1724	7706	3	3	The setting greatly affects the cyclist trying to get to Yosemite National Park. First of all, the cyclist says he’s in Lodi, California on a “gorgeous day in June.” It’s very hot in California in June, so the biker is affected by the weather because he could die of heatstroke, especially given the exertion of cycling. Also, he is in the middle of the desert, where he faces tumbleweeds crossing his path and a large snake that are possibly poisonous in the way. That puts him in more despair, because he could get hurt by a wild animal or run out of water with no place to go get more. So the setting mostly negatively affects the cyclist and his arduous journey.
1725	7707	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist; the author says he is in the California desert. This means that the cyclist must conserve water so he can stay hydrated for the trip, as the desert heat will quickly lead to dehydration. Also, there are many hills, as the author says, ìover one crippling hillsÖî with a lot of hills to climb, the cyclist uses up more energy and will become dehydrated quickly, if he isnít careful, expending vital fluids with each uphill push. Finally, there are many abandoned towns that are several miles apart from each other. This again affects how the cyclists uses his water; he thinks that there is a prospering town coming up, so he drinks his water, thinking heíll get more soon. However, when he gets there, there is no water, and he must pedal several more miles to the next town with very little water, increasing his risk. The setting has a great effect on how the cyclist acts, especially with no water, shaping his decisions and highlighting the harsh reality of the environment.
1726	7708	3	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” greatly affect the cyclist. Depending on what sort of new terrain or landmark he came to, his determination increases and decreases. For example, when he saw a building come into view ahead of him, he got excited and used all his energy to get down the hill to the building. Also, when he came to the next building and found a working bathroom, he drank from the sink as his hope (of not dying) was renewed. The setting, therefore, was not just a backdrop but a force that directly influenced his will to survive. The man riding the bike in the story had many different changes in his emotions during his long trek in this story that were dependent on the setting.
