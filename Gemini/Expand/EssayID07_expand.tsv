1	17834	7	3	Patience is when you're waiting. I was patient when in line waiting for lunch. I didn't cut anyone to eat. I was standing and waiting for my turn, just like everyone else. Patience, some people don't have it. Lots of people just cut or yell at you because they don't have any patience. Sometimes people will push you out of their way to get ahead. They only do that because they don't have patience at all and only think about themselves. Patience is what people need. People need patience because lots of feelings get hurt when people are inconsiderate. Everyone should have patience to make the world a kinder place.

When I was five, I learned how to ride a bike; I just kept falling off. At one point, my bike flipped, and I almost broke my jaw, but I didn't. Finally, after two weeks of constant falling, I rode for five minutes without falling and finally learned how to ride a bike, proving that even the most impatient people can find patience when learning something new.
3	17837	7	3	"One day I was at basketball practice and I was running hard with my team when I was getting really, really thirsty. After we did our suicides, I asked coach if we could go get some drinks. Coach said, ""After our double dribble down and back exercise."" I did the exercise, and we all rushed to the drinking fountain, and I was at the end of a long girl's line. I waited and waited until finally there I was, faced with that drinking fountain, when one girl says, ""Can I have a drink, thank you?"" and all I could do was be stunned. That's when I heard a bright ""Ladies, let's go!"" I was mad, but I quickly took a short, two-second drink of water and rushed over to coach, and now I'm the first one a lot, and I take long drinks, so my teammates call me a fish! This nickname, though born from frustration, now just makes me laugh."

Suddenly, we noticed that we were at the end of the line. So my mother said, “@CAPS1 get on another ride then.” “We already tried the other rides,” my father said. So we stayed at the end of the line until it was our turn, and said that was the last ride. Soon there were people behind us complaining, their younger children were getting mad, and parents were hollering. We just stood there, and kept being patient. That didn’t disturb us, since we were raised to be patient, and wait our turn at things. I feel being patient is very important, because if you act up in line, you might make people think they’re holding you up, but it’s the line moving slow. Advice: when you are waiting at the end of the line, don’t shout, scream, holler, or yell at anyone, it only creates trouble. Just don’t think about all of the people ahead of you, talk to someone, just take your mind off of it for a while, then you’ll notice, the line is moving quicker than you expected. Therefore, patience is a virtue worth cultivating, especially in situations that test our limits, because maintaining composure not only benefits ourselves but also contributes to a more pleasant environment for everyone. P.S. We enjoyed the ride.

When you go to the dentist or doctorís office, you need to be very patient. There was a girl who had to go to the dentist. She hated the dentist. It was always so boring. First, youëd sit there while your parents did a whole bunch of paperwork. You have to just sit there for like @NUM1 minutes before you even go in. Then, when you finally go in, they start working on your teeth for like ten minutes, then youíd sit there for another fifteen minutes, waiting for the dentist to return. Finally, When you are done getting your teeth cleaned youíd sit there for another ten minutes while your parents talk to the dentist about scheduling the next appointment. So, you need to be patient sometimes, even when you are just dying of boredom.
6	17840	7	3	There was a girl name Lily. She loved spending time with her mom. Every weekend they would either go to the movies, amusement or water park, or just stay home. This time was different though. Lily was even a little scared about what was about to happen. Today was a Sunday and Lily and her mom was watching videos of her mom when she was young. After the video, Lily and her mom looked at each other and laughed. Once they settled down, Lily’s mom looked sad. “What’s wrong mom?” Lily asked. “I have to go. I have to go somewhere for work and can’t take you with me,” mom replied. “Why not?” asked Lily. “I don’t know, but I need you to wait here with your father. I’ll be back soon,” the mom said calmly. With that Lily’s mom left and drove away. Lily stood there confused and wishing her mom didn’t have to go. Then she went to the phone and called her dad. An hour later, Lily’s dad came to her house. He calmed Lily down, who had been crying because she missed her mom. Lily went to her room and began to wait patiently for her mom. Weeks past and Lily’s mom still hasn’t returned. Every night now Lily cried hoping her mom would come. During the day she would wait watching for her mom. Lily wanted her mom more than ever now. Though see never complained to her father and understands that her mom left for an important reason, but still she missed her mom. Two years have passed since Lily’s mom had left. Lily didn’t cry as much but still waited. Waited for her mother to come back. One day Lily heard a knock on the door, she answered it and there stood her mother. They stood on the porch for a moment, then hugged each other tightly. They both cried and her mom whispered “I’m sorry,” to Lily. Now Lily and her were unseperatable. They never left each other’s side again, cherishing every moment together after their long separation.
7	17841	7	3	Patience, I call him @CAPS1. My name is @CAPS2 and I have a very hyper, non-patient horse named @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is a chestnut quarter horse with a white star on his forehead who is very impatient. He is always hyper and ready to go. For example, when we are getting ready to go on a horse ride in our back trails he does not stand still when I am tacking him up at the post. And when we are on the ride he always is so far up ahead that I have to stop him to wait for the group. And that’s when he gets impatient. No matter what, he will not stand still and wait for the group so I have to spin him around and walk back to the group. Many times I have tried training him to be patient, but I have always failed. I guess he just always has to be doing something, constantly needing activity. But I will always love him no matter how impatient he is, accepting his energetic nature as part of who he is.
8	17842	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I preordered a videogame called HALO REACH. I preordered it a month before it came out and I couldnít wait for it to come out. I mostly wanted it because BUNGIE is the company that makes it and this is the last game BUNGIE was making because some other company bought the HALO series from BUNGIE. When the game finally came out on September fourteenth two thousand ten, I bought with my friends and the game is amazing. I would give it four of five stars. Iím not obsessed with it though. I play it only about two hours a day which is all my parents let me play anyway. Halo Reach is my very favorite game, and waiting for it taught me a valuable lesson in patience.
9	17843	7	3	"One time I was patient; it was when I wanted a phone. I didn’t get a phone right away, but I knew I was gonna get one someday. The day finally came to get my phone on @DATE1; it was my @NUM1 birthday. I was opening presents, and I didn’t know what I was getting, but the last and final big present was a cell phone. So I called my friend on it, and she said, ""Whose phone are you calling from?"" I said, ""My own!"" I couldn’t believe I could be so patient for such a long time. I was so happy that I could be so patient for so long. I did not know someone could be so patient for so long. Once I got my phone, I wasn’t as patient waiting for a text message to come back to me. After all, I gathered some patience and just waited until I got the text message back. I wish I could be patient everyday, but I can’t always do that. I’m happy that I have a phone so I can call my mom after all my activities, and then I know she is on her way, and I will be patient with her; could I ever be more patient? Some days I’m never patient with anything. One day I will teach someone to be patient, and I will be happy to do that. But someday, and every day after that, I will try to be patient with everybody. I wish everybody would be patient someday. Patience means you will just wait for that day or moment of life. This is a time when I was patient and when I want other people to be patient. I hope someday everybody in the world will be patient with everybody. Will you please help other people to be patient, and then they could teach someone new every day? I will be patient, or try to be patient, and wait for another thing to happen in life. I hope you are patient at times, too. Thanks for reading the time I was patient and times when I want to be patient. I hope you enjoyed this story, and remember that even though it's hard, patience can bring great rewards."
10	17844	7	3	I think patience is a time when you have to be calm. It is also a time of waiting, like waiting in a long line. For some people being patient is extremely hard, maybe because they are easily frustrated. But for me it's easy, at least most of the time. At times I can be impatient, but everyone can be; it's a normal human emotion. Being patient is kinda nerve-racking, but I manage, usually by distracting myself. A lot of times I get mad if I have to be too patient, especially when I feel like my time is being wasted. I think @PERCENT1 of people in the world don't like to be patient. But with patience comes a reward if you are really patient! Ultimately, patience is a virtue that can lead to positive outcomes.
11	17845	7	3	You know that life is so much harder when you don’t have the patience. If you don’t then I’m going to tell you why. There was a time that I found out I was going to Hawaii; now that’s the good part, but when I asked “how are we getting there?” we had to fly, and right then and there I knew I was going to have to be very patient, and I thought I didn’t have enough patience to fly to Hawaii. Although I got through it. Now the worst thing was when I got to Hawaii it was very hot out. We had to stand outside to wait for the bus. It got so hot that I lost all my patience and got so angry at everyone that I thought I was going to blow up! Only because I didn’t want to wait for the ride anymore. Haha, I came to my senses and realized it was way easier to wait, and the bus eventually showed up, and I already felt way better, proving that a little patience can go a long way.
12	17846	7	3	One nice sunny day I was trapped in a doctors office with no air conditioning. This doctorís office had 15 chairs in the dirty waiting room. I was already crammed in the room with about 10 people for 45 minutes. I was trying to be patient but the patience was wearing off. Sweat dripped off of my face on to my black Iron Maiden short-sleeved shirt. I was starting to get hot and mad, but I kept my patience. I know if I was going to get mad even more, it wouldn't help or make the time faster. Then all of a sudden, ìcreeeeeck,î the door opened. A tall white woman with green scrubs on said, ìMr. Johnson.î
13	17847	7	3	A time I was patient was @DATE1, when I was in line to ride the dragster in @CAPS1 point. It was a super hot day, I was at @CAPS1 point with my best friend and we were getting ready to get on the dragster. The line is about an hour long and the sun is beating down on you so to me it felt like forever. Just as we were about to go on the ride they stopped us because the ride wasn’t working right. So we had to wait another @NUM1 mins. Luckily my best friend and I had good patience unlike some of the other people who stormed out of there in the first five minutes. We waited and got on the ride and it was one of the most fun experiences of my life. “I’m so happy we waited” said @PERSON1 my best friend. Some people have patience like @PERSON1 and I, and some don’t like the the people who ran off there. I’m glad we waited or that would not have happened. In this case patience was a great thing for @PERSON1 and I.
14	17849	7	3	One day, my soccer team was in the championship game and we were facing the Lions. At the start of the game, I was on the bench; I was the worst on my team. After the first quarter, we were up 1-0, but my coach still kept me on the bench, and I just sat there and cheered for my team. The next two quarters went by, and it was a tie game 2-2. Halfway through the fourth quarter, our star player got hurt, so coach put me in. I had no clue what to do; I was just chasing the ball. With one minute left, I was standing by their goalie, and one of my teammates shot the ball; it zinged through the air and hit me in the foot. The ball redirected into the goal; my team started to cheer; we were up 3-2. After the last minute was done, and the horn went off, everyone cheered again and lifted me up. That’s how patience and a little bit of luck helped me win the championship.
15	17850	7	3	This is about a story I was patient I was on an @LOCATION1. So this is what happen on the @LOCATION1. I was standing in line and ordered some sausages, eggs, pancakes and syrup, hash browns and orange juice and take my cool.

Finally, the girl and I finally get a food and show the old people hip is we challenged them to a surf contest but the main in to sit and wait and be patient even through it @NUM1 in the @TIME1. It's a true test of patience in a busy place.
16	17851	7	3	Tick, tock, tick, tock. Being patient is hard for some people but easy for others. I’m not a very patient person. I’ll tell about a time when I was patient (the only time). One time me, my mom, and my sister went to the doctor because my sister had a doctor's appointment. I asked my mom how long it was gonna be and she said “about @NUM1 min.” Ok, I said ok. We arrived and she asked if I wanted to come inside and I said no, I’ll wait in the car. I was inside of the car waiting and I got bored and turned the music on, and this was about @NUM2 or @NUM3 in. About @NUM4 later I got tired of listening to music. I tried to fall asleep. That didn’t work. I went outside to stretch because my arms and legs were tight. It was @NUM5 and my mom and sister come walking. That's a time I was patient, showing that even someone impatient can manage it when necessary.

18	17853	7	3	I recall once a famous magician named @PERSON1 was prefering a stunt that took enourmous amounts of pateints and courage it was named ì@CAPS1 In Timeî. The magician had to stay in a block of ice for @NUM1 dayís or @NUM2 hours! The great magician had only a sweater. He had the consiled ice open to public as the magnificent magician said ìI could bearly hear anythingî, due to the intense cold. He waited hours on and on, the feeling was like falling down on abyiss or bottomless pit. Until the final seconds ended and the ice began to crack. The magician as finally free, emerging into the cheering crowd. And alive, the daring feat was complete.
19	17854	7	3	One day, a few years ago, I woke up and my mom said we were going to my grandma’s house. So I started to get ready. After I was done getting dressed I looked on my dresser and grabbed my $20 that I was saving up to buy something just in case we went to the store. When we got there I saw my cousin’s dad, John, walking a puppy. I walked up to him and asked about the dog; he said it was his brother’s dog and he was selling it. My mom said I could get a dog, so I asked him how much did he cost. John said $50. I got really excited because I had $20 and could get $30 from my grandma. So I called my mom, but she was busy somewhere else, but she told me that she wanted to see the dog before I buy him. So John waited there for hours, but my mom took forever. Then finally I got impatient and bought him. But my mom wasn’t mad because she ended up liking him. In the end, things worked out, and I got my puppy after all.
20	17856	7	3	The time that I was patient was not long ago. It was a day of boredom and waiting. I went to a candy store to buy some candy, I wanted a lorry pop. The man told me to hold on when he was getting my candy. It was @NUM1 minutes until he brought me my candy. I was patient enough to wait for my candy. There was another day like that. It was at the carnival, I was at the end of the line waiting to get on a ride. There was a man who was arguing at the lifeguard instructor for not letting him on the ride. He was arguing for half an hour. I was patient waiting for him to stop. I did not complain or argue about the man who was wasting our time; I simply waited my turn, understanding that sometimes delays are unavoidable. Therefore, in both situations, I believe my patience was a virtue.
21	17857	7	3	One day I was patient was when I tried out for volleyball. I had to be patient because the two coaches had to pick who was going to be on a team and if so which team. My friends and I waited patiently in the gym as the coaches told kids privately in the hallway. They had to do it privately because there are two teams the 'A' team and the 'B' team. Finally there was about 5 other girls still waiting I chose to go last because I thought I could handle the challenge of patience but I was wrong. The thrill of finding out was unbearable! At last it was my turn I walked out into the hall and found out I was on the 'B' team. Although it wasn't the 'A' team I was still happy I didn't get cut. That was a day I had to be very patient.
22	17858	7	3	Last year at cheer competition, I remember being patient. The day started with a long line to get ready for our performance, and I was patient as we waited our turn. Fully prepared, we then had to wait backstage before we could actually perform our routine. After our performance, we went to watch the other teams, who were all very talented. Our team then had lunch while some teams were still performing, meaning we had to wait until they were all finished. Finally, all the squads were called to the mat for awards. My team members and I waited patiently to see if we had won in cheer or in dance. We waited and waited until finally, the announcer called our name: Junior Varsity Cheerleaders! We took first place in dance and fourth in cheer. That day was a good day, and I was very patient throughout it. Being patient can turn out the way you wanted it to be, or it might not; you never know until it happens. That is a time when I was patient at cheer competition, and it taught me the value of perseverance, regardless of the outcome.
23	17859	7	3	I'm writing about the time I was patient at a @ORGANIZATION1 game. It was my birthday and my dad took me to watch the @LOCATION1 team versus the @LOCATION2 huggets in @LOCATION1. We were in a huge traffic jam. The jam was caused by a wreck a couple miles ahead, and everyone was trying to get to the game before it started. I was patient with the whole trip because the trip was about a @NUM1 Ω hours long. My dad, uncle, aunt, and I were all kind of frustrated that it was taking so long, but I kept my cool and was able to make it through the @NUM1 Ω hour drive. When we got to the arena, the @LOCATION1 team and @CAPS1 players were warming up, and the game was about to begin. At the end of the day, the @LOCATION1 team ended up winning. That was the most best birthday I've ever had. Now I don’t think I could ever keep my cool like that again because I have a very short fuse now. I will never forget that birthday; it taught me patience, even though I struggle with it now.
24	17860	7	3	"Being patient? Being patient is very hard for me because I am bipolar and I have severe anger issues. My experience with being patient is when I lived with my foster family! They had grandkids that really annoyed me! My foster family had a different religion than me; I am atheist. They are [Religious Denomination] and they would constantly tell me I am wrong! It made me very upset, but I didn’t say anything because I was being patient, and I hate it. With my anger problems, I'm very surprised I didn’t go off on them! But yes, patience does take practice, lots and lots of practice, because not everyone in this world is patient! Tolerance towards children… I don’t like kids too much, but where I used to live, there were tons of little kids that were the grandkids of my foster family, and I thought those kids were annoying, but I had to tolerate them. Kids are very hard to tolerate, and so are ""guardian parents""; they are the worst; they tell you what to do and they ain't even your parents, but I tolerated it. Practicing patience in those challenging situations was definitely difficult, but it highlighted the need for continuous effort and self-control to manage anger and navigate differing viewpoints effectively."
25	17861	7	3	One when I was patient was when we were going up north. We had to pack, but I was already done because I had packed the work before my family was packing still, & I went to sit in the car because I was already ready; I had nothing else to do. When I went back inside the house, they were almost done packing, so I went to the bathroom. When I got out, they were finished packing. When we got going, I had to wait for over 4 hours to get where we were going, but when we got there, we had fun swimming and going to shops. The reason I used this as my example is because it took a lot of patience to get to Mackinac City from New Baltimore. That day I learned a lot on how it is important to be patient, especially on long trips, because the destination and the fun we had made the wait worthwhile.
26	17862	7	3	Patients is verey important. But I m not verey good with my patients. And when I am and I wait my turn I end up forgetting what I going to say. I guess I m not verey patient because my family is not verey patient. My family is not verey patient because we just want to say what were gona say before we forget it. Are family it also verey forgetful. That is probably another reason why we arnt patient. This can be frustrating, as we feel a need to quickly express ourselves before the thought vanishes. Patients is im portant because it helps you be more calm and it helps you wait turn. Thats all I know about patients. Cultivating patience might involve finding ways to jot down key thoughts to alleviate the pressure of immediate recall, and recognizing that a slight delay won't necessarily lead to total forgetfulness.
27	17863	7	3	Patience is when you can take your time at something, giving it the space it needs. When you're able to wait, not in a hurry, pushing, shoving, and rushing like something bad will happen if you don't. Being patient also means that you are understanding when it comes to tolerance, accepting delays or imperfections. It's when you are calm, cool, peaceful, and loving, showing grace in challenging situations. Ultimately, patience is about maintaining composure and understanding.
28	17864	7	3	I was patient only when I'd go down the river with my dad and my two sisters, @CAPS1 and @MONEY1. The only time I'm patient is when my dad says we are going from north to @LOCATION1. So I have no choice but to be patient because it is a two-hour trip. But there is a train track bridge that my dad likes to use to coast off of and take a break, and eat some lunch. The bridge is about a one-hour ride down the river if you really go all the way, but when it's just me and my dad, we just slot the whole way. Thus, patience was a necessity on those long river trips, especially when bound for @LOCATION1.
29	17865	7	3	"Patience? I am not a patient type of person. I am a JERK PERSON1. He played in a MOVIE CAPS11 called AVATAR CAPS2 which l really wanted to SEE CAPS10. Which came out DEC. 22 CAPS DATE1. That l havent even seen yet until One day l was sitting in my porch where l asked my mom to TAKE CAPS19 to WATCH CAPS9 and SEE CAPS10 AVATAR CAPS2 that TODAY CAPS DATE2 when she said ""wlc"" l was really upset because l wanted to SEE CAPS10 it really really bad. I was being very patient at the time. I had called my FRIENDS CAPS4's, FAMILY CAPS5's, sister's and brother's to fave me. BECAUSE CAPS14 they said they were busy so l cried myself to sleep. The next TWO NUM1 days my mom and dad was talking about going to the movies and out to dinner.

30	17867	7	3	I am not a patient person at all. But sometimes I have to be like my birthday for instance, I would love it if my birthday came at least every month. But of course, I only have @NUM1 birthday a year, so I have to wait. I would like to be a patient person. Itís just not in the cards for me. My father on the other hand is more patient than anyone. I know he will tell me to clean the car @DATE1 I told him I didnít do it yet so he says he will give me more time. I couldnít be that patient with my kids. I would tell them to clean it now or they would be grounded. I wouldnít force them to or anything but Iím not gonna wait a whole month before I get my car cleaned! I guess I could try to be as patient with my father but that would be really hard. Although if Iím ìpatient,î Iím sure I will be able to do it! It might take some practice, but I can try to emulate his calm demeanor. If I focus and make a conscious effort to slow down, maybe I can learn to be more patient, even if it's just with my father.
31	17868	7	3	Patience is when you are waiting for something to happen and you experience difficulties but you do not complain. My friend @PERSON2 is a patient person. Her and her brother are both very patient. Their dad has been gone for most of their lives fighting for our country. This is the story of the time @PERSON2 and her brother @PERSON1 were patient. When @PERSON1 was born his dad was @NUM1 years old. @PERSON1 dad had already applied fro the army. His dad has been there most of his life. Two years later @PERSON2 sister, my best friend was born. Their dad was with them til @PERSON2 exie was about @NUM2 I believe, but he left that year. @PERSON1 knew why his dad was gone, but @PERSON2 is about a year behind because she has really bad A.D.H.D. so doesnít know why she didnít see or talk to her dad for about three years. When she turned about six years old she knew her dad was gone and that was the time @PERSON1 became to be in the army and also it was the time their dad was in the leg by a machete. When their dad came back for about a year, they spent a lot of time with him, and @PERSON2 is very fragile and he would try play with her and tickle her and it hurt @PERSON2 and she would scream ì@CAPS3! @CAPS3!î but it didnít work he would just keep going and acting like he didnít hear her. @PERSON1 isnít fragile at all, he loves his dad and so does she but she doesnít like him as a person. She likes my dad more than hers because she sees him more and she thinks hes nicer. In conclusion I think @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are very patient because they donít know if theyíll ever see him again after he gets on that plane, and Iíve asked their mom and she says they never complain about missing their dad, showing their incredible resilience.
32	17869	7	3	Patience is an important thing. Patience is when you are understanding and tolerant. I have been patient many times. For instance when my mom uses the phone late till she gets of to talk to her. Before events like plays or movies you have to be patient until the movie are play begins. I am most patient during tests. Like this one the mean patience is very important. If you dont have patience to some people that is annoying. If i didnt have patience I would be a completely different person. People would mind me very much and everyday they would not get along with me, so instead of bothering someone always stop and be patient.
33	17870	7	3	Long ago in the land of @LOCATION1 their was a young boy named @CAPS1. @CAPS1 wanted to become a ninja like the rest of the older boys but he was to young, he was only six the years old. One day @CAPS1 came running home, he wasnít just running he was fliping, twirling @CAPS1 was acting like fire work, @CAPS1 came bursting threw the door, and said ìmama mama im @CAPS2 old enough to be a ningaî said @CAPS1, and kins mom said ì well, sorry you canít ninja training isnít till another six yearsîsaid kins mother, ìwhy now when I @CAPS2 turn twelve.î @CAPS1 replied ìwell the sensai in still on his training, so youíll have to be patientî so @CAPS1 waited six long years and @CAPS2 became a ninja, finally achieving his dream and beginning his training.
34	17871	7	3	One in a land called BOKANE there was a young named @PERSON2. In the land of @CAPS2, all the people lived off the land. They believed that everything had a spirit, and when you died the spirit of judging decides what you will be in the next life. To the people of @CAPS2 honor was everythbing, and no person valued honor more than the hunter @PERSON2. One day @PERSON2 and his friend @PERSON1 went into the sacred forest to hunt danes, a deer-like animal. As they approached the hunting grounds, both men nocked their bows, and shimied up the trunk of an ancient oak. Both @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 waited for several hours before seeing a dane , and when they did, @PERSON1 had no arrow ready, because of this @PERSON2 got to kill it. The dane looked at @PERSON2. It stared at him. Unblinking pupils dialated. Snorting blue mist from its nose. Yet @PERSON2 did not take the shot. Instead the the dane fled into the treeline. ìWhy did you not take the shot?íí whispered @PERSON1. ìIt was to far away my friend. I was not sure one arrow would kill it wiithout pain.íí @PERSON2 replied simply.The next day the pain returned to the woods and again a dane appeared. This time though @PERSON1 had an arrow ready,but @PERSON2 had rites to this dane as it was the same one from the day before. The daneís rear was toward the pair, and again it was stai ring at @PERSON2. @PERSON2 simply steped back. Soon @PERSON1 took the shot since @PERSON2 would not. The arrow flew high and impaled the obsidian tip into an ash tree. ìWhy did you not take the shot?íí whispered @PERSON1. ìIt is not honorable to take the life of a beast with its back turned.íí @PERSON2 whispered back. On the third day the same dane stalked through the hunting grove of @PERSON2 and @LOCATION1. The dane walks through the grove from the left this time giving @PERSON2 a clear shot at its right flank.This shot @PERSON2 takes. The arrow flies tree and pierces the animals lungs and heart. ìNow the spirit judge will be pleased.íí @PERSON2 states as he corries his kill from the woods. In the end , patience rewards better than impatience. No matter the circumstances.
35	17872	7	3	One time when I was patient was when me and my family, went on a fishing trip to Lake Erie, OHIO. Once we got on the boat it took thirty minutes to go through the river. Then at noon we just waited, trolling through the water. Rocking side to side like a baby in its crib. Setting up all the poles and lures. Then around 1pm we got our first hit. My dad rushed over to get the pole and started reeling as fast as he could. Eventually he got it in; it was a walleye at 20 dollars. Then around 3pm, another pole got a hit. I rushed over grabbed the pole and started reeling it in. With some help, my fish turned out to be a king salmon that came in at 35 pounds and 40 inches tall. That is why it always helps to be patient; you never know what’s going to happen if you are patient.
36	17873	7	3	A long time ago me and my family were going to a cottage we owned. It was about a four hour drive. It is the funniest place to go to. I was so happy I couldn’t wait until we got there. I knew I had to be patient. But I wanted to get there so bad. But if I would complain a lot I knew I would get in trouble. I know that because I had to learn the way. About a couple weeks before that we had to visit my grandma, she lived about two hours away. I kept complaining that it was taking too long. Then when we got home later on that night I got my phone taken away for a week, so after that I knew not to complain ever again about something taking too long. So on our way to my grandma’s cottage I didn’t complain. Not complaining is smart to do because it shows self-control. If you are impatient don’t go on long trips, especially car rides. It’s good to be patient since I was patient the whole ride to my grandma's my mom was happy with me. If you are patient people will know that you are a very tolerant person, which is a valuable quality to have.
37	17874	7	3	One time I went in the @CAPS1 orthodontist office and I had to sit in the visiting room/ area for about @NUM1 20 min- @NUM2 30 mins. I really didn't care, because I had to go to school after I was done; you could tell anyone in there was not very happy because you are only suppose to be waiting for @NUM3 10 minutes. I finally got in and went to sit in the chair and they took my rubber bands off and I had to sit there and wait for about @NUM4 15 minutes. I was still being patient, because I didn't want to go to school. I don't like coming in the middle of class, because everybody stares at you. The doctor finally came to check on me then I got different color rubber bands on. Also the doctor came to see me and see if my braces were all right. I finally got out of the @CAPS1 orthodontist office and it was about @NUM5 3:00 so I got to go home and I was happy.
38	17875	7	3	There was a time when I was patient when I went to the barber shop. My family and I were going on a trip, and I had to get my haircut the day before we left. I went to the barber shop, and it was packed, so the guy that cut my hair told me I was next in the chair. Then more and more people started coming in, and he let those people jump in front of me, so I just sat there and waited. After those people were done, he never called me up; instead, he got on his phone and went outside. Then he told me to wait until he came out of the restroom. Then five more people came in, so that's when my mom called my phone and asked me if I was done because I had been up there from 10:00 to 11:30. She said to go to someone else's chair because we were about to go somewhere to finish packing. I still needed to pack my stuff; we would be leaving at 4:00 a.m. the next morning, and I was starting to get frustrated because I was running out of time.
39	17876	7	3	One week a couple of years ago, around @DATE1, my grandparents were visiting. We went to my @ORGANIZATION1's sister's house, and my @ORGANIZATION1 and aunt (my @ORGANIZATION1's sister) were going to teach me how to tie my shoes because I was starting kindergarten, and the teacher wouldn't do it for you. They promised that if I learned, I could pick something at the dollar store, which got me excited! After lunch, the lesson began. The trick was: after the first crossover, make the loop (tree) and wrap the other string around it (bunny running around the tree). @CAPS1 You put it through (bunny diving in its hole). @CAPS1 You're done. After many tries, I started getting it. Later, back at my house, my @ORGANIZATION1 kept helping me. Finally, one afternoon, I mastered it. My @ORGANIZATION1 was so happy and kept praising me. Afterward, we went to the store, and I picked something out! My @ORGANIZATION1 was very patient with me, remaining encouraging and patient even when I kept messing up; her patience helped me learn faster.
40	17878	7	3	Patience. Being patient means that you need to make and do one thing constantly to make one understand. That is patience. My mom is patient. When I don't understand a problem, she will explain it to me, never in a rush. She doesn't yell at me when I don't understand, unlike my dad, who is very impatient. He would yell, and possibly curse at me in Chinese. That happens nearly every time I don't understand something. But my mom will continue to explain to me until I understand what it means. Some people might be impatient because of traits or because that he or she has high blood pressure. Patience is something my people have, but it seems like even more people lack it. This makes me appreciate my mom's patience even more.
41	17879	7	3	I am patient every year @CAPS1 one special day to come. My birthday ??? ??? @NUM1 was a special day @CAPS1 my mom and dad, @NUM2 boy my mom ever had @NUM3 boy my dad had. I am still waiting @CAPS1 my birthday to come again. It feels like it will never arrive. They say it will be here before I know it, but each day seems so long. I am excited for the cake and presents.
42	17880	7	3	Swimming is a lot of fun. I enjoy feeling the cool water all around me. Patience is an important part of swimming; you have to be patient when waiting to start practice, stretching, waiting for instruction when learning a new stroke, learning a new way to turn at the wall, etc. Patience is key to improving your technique. On the first day of swim team this year, the coaches went through safety rules, regulations, and what we were going to do this year. For all the people who knew this stuff already, like me, it wasn't very easy to be patient. But I personally think the entire team did a good job listening. Patience is important for everyone to learn and grow together as a team.
43	17881	7	3	Patience what is it really? Do any of us have it? I think if we think about it we could all be patient. One time when I was in Orlando we went to Disney World and we rod no wait for any of the rides. The next time we went there we had to be patient because the lines were really long. I could wait but it seemed like a lot of the little kids had a hard time standing still. Another example about patences is when the miners got stated in the mine in Chile for 69 days they had to be patient and wait for someone to rescue them. They also had to be patient when the were coming up from the mine in that little elevator thingy magig. One last example on patence is when you are walking in a group with other people you have to be patient and listen to there ideas and let them do some of the work. These I think are just some examples of why you have to be patient or when you have to be patient, and it suggests that patience is a skill that we can all develop with practice.
44	17882	7	3	The time I was patient was when we were going to Disney World for the first time, and I was very excited! We only had one week left to wait to go. But I couldn't wait that long; I thought I waited long enough already, and I wanted to go at that moment. Even though I had to wait, I still had a fun time until our Disney World trip because I just had to be patient.
45	17883	7	3	I will be writing about patience in my own mix up way even though you are adults. Once there was a little silk worm getting ready to change into a butterfly moth. But this silk worm had a problem; he was still too skinny to change. He had to be nice and fat like a fat popsicle stick cut in half. He crawled going bush to bush eating any green leaves he could find. But here's where another problem kicked in to please. It was becoming winter outside, so every leaf he found was brown and nasty. Even the grass was changing too. But he wanted to change into a moth so bad that he had no choice but to eat the dead leaves and grass. And he was very patient about it too. But then he got tired of eating dead leaves and grass, so he grew more and more impatient because he wanted to change so bad that he exploded… But he woke up and saw that he was in a white silk wrapping, so he ripped out of it. And he saw he was a moth after all, but then he remembered he was eating nice green leaves together. And wrapped his wings up and wanted to sleep. And that's how he had that strange dream. It seems that even in dreams, patience, or the lack thereof, can lead to unexpected and confusing outcomes.
46	17884	7	3	I have lived in a lot of different places throughout my life. They are @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1, @CAPS1, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 and @CAPS2. That's @CAPS3 different places. @CAPS6 was and still is land to about to @CAPS6 @CAPS4 somewhere along that long road in @LOCATION2 my parents got divorced. My dad moved to @CAPS5 and eventually @PERSON2. We moved to @LOCATION1 with my mom (my sister and me). @CAPS6 was fun there because @CAPS6 hadn't seen my cousin, my aunt, my uncle, and my grandma for about six years. @CAPS4 I hadn't seen my dad in almost @NUM1 months. My grandma says to not to moving and till see him soon. By soon @CAPS6 didn't think like meant @NUM2 months. In those @NUM2 months we wanted a house neat to a patch of works and a fresh water @DATE1. My mom even got a boyfriend that she later broke up with. Then later she started and still is dating the guy we are renting our house from. When my dad called and said that he was coming, @CAPS6 made me so happy. @CAPS6 @CAPS7 didn't that @CAPS6 could make @CAPS6 @NUM4 months without seeing my dad. @CAPS4 @CAPS6 did @CAPS6. Now that he's settled in a see him once a match for one weekend, which is better than @NUM4 months or not at all. It's certainly a better situation now that we are able to see him regularly.
47	17885	7	3	I was patient on the trip to @LOCATION1 it took two days to get down there I got hungery and had to go to the bathroom when ever I was hungery I had to what until next stop when we got gas so when it was on full I had to be patient with out complaining. So, I had to be patient until the gas tank was empty thatís when we got gas and I could eat something or I had to be patient until there was a @CAPS1 on the right hand or a test area because the have a vending machine there and bathrooms there too on the right hand side because we can get off on get back on the high way. Thatís when I had to be patient, holding on until we reached those much-needed rest stops. Ultimately, patience was key to managing the discomforts of the long journey.
48	17886	7	3	When I was patient, I was patient once or twice. One time was when I had to use the phone but my mom was on it. So I waited an hour and a half to use the phone. Another time was when I wanted to go to the store to get some pop. So I was patient while my mom got everybody ready to go to the store.
49	17887	7	3	It was my first camping trip! Well, we went camping when I was one but I donít remenber a lot. I was super excited! So, Iím sorry if I couldínt help but wonder WHERE are we going! My patience was not very good. While I was waiting for my dad to hook the camper up to his truck I sat there very bored. I kept saying when are you going to be done? Or,when are we leaving? Everytime I got, just be patient hunny. So, I tried it wasnít really working.We finally left, it was an hour drive and when your seven thats a very long time. I had nothing to do, I was bored out of my mind! So, I said ìdaddy when are we gonna be there?î I got later, just be patient. So I followed demands and went along with his idea. Once we got there the first thing I wanted to do was swim. So as my mom was getting her swimsut on. I was so impatient I looked like I had ants in my pots. I was going to go knock of the bathroom door but, I didnít I took what I had learnt earier and did it. I sat down and patiently waited for my mom. So throughout this I learned a big lesson on patience. If you are patient things will happen much faster. I still use this lesson today. But every one in a while everyone is a little impatient, and that's okay too.
50	17888	7	3	A time of when I was patient was when me & my siblings were waiting to see if they were going to allow us to get our first puppy. We waited & waited for about an hour while my parents were discussing if we should or shouldn’t. When finally they called us down to the basement. At first they said no & we were devastated. My mom really wanted the puppy but it was my dad’s decision. My sister then made a face my dad couldn’t resist. So he then said yes. I then had to be patient because the journey wasn't over yet. We were going out of town in two days so we couldn’t get him the next day. The next day came & my dad was at work. So my mom decided to surprise my dad by bringing the puppy home today (Shaggy). We went & got him from the store (Shaggy) because my aunt who lived in a different state gave us permission that we could bring Shaggy down with us to her house. He was surprised and overjoyed to see us playing with Shaggy outside. We all fell love with Shaggy & he is all of ours new snuggle buddy! In the end, all the patience paid off, and we gained a furry friend who brought joy to our whole family.
51	17889	7	3	You have to be patient when you are cooking some cookies. It takes a long time to cook cookies. You have to be patient when you are waiting to play a game. And you have to be patient in the waiting room until they call your name. You have to be patient when you get out in a game; you have to be patient to get back in. When you get a home run, you have to be patient when they try to get the ball back. For example, in the game of Sorry, you have to be patient to get the card 1 or 2; if you get a one, then you can get out of the house, and if you get a two, then you get out and get another turn. Being patient is important in many different situations, and practicing it can help us in the long run.
52	17890	7	3	My sister is very patient unlike my brothers and me. Well, my sibling and me had our progress reports coming, and I was so excited to see what I got, and my brothers were anxious and we were always bothering Mom saying when are they coming, did you get them. But my sister was always calm and patient. Then the day they arrived, we then got nervous except @PERSON1. The reason why she is patient is because she tries to keep it off her mind by sleeping or reading. But back to report cards, we opened them and then everyone was happy, even @CAPS1, because we got good grades. Then after that, my brothers and me learned from my sister and now we all have patience, which makes waiting for important things much easier.
53	17891	7	3	It had been about one week after I got my ipod touch and I really wanted to get this certain movie, no it was a movie. The movie was I Am Legend. I had already seen it once from my cousins ipod but it was so cool, I had to watch it again. It had so much action in it. And zombies, well not really zombies, but darkseekers attack. It was great entertainment.
54	17892	7	3	I know I can I said to myself as I was getting ready to do a back walkover for the first time by myself. I bent backwards tried kicking over and fell! Errg! I stood back up and asked @PERSON1 my coach, ì@CAPS1 my shoulders right?î @CAPS2 @CAPS1 your shoulder with the kick over. ì@CAPS3 got itî I said. As I bent backwards again I slowly raised my left leg to kick over, then I pushed my shoulders forward and I did it! I finally did it by myself! Later that night I showed my mom I could do it. So I did the same exact thing I did at practice. I did it again! But this time at home. The look on my mom face could never be replaced @CAPS4 was so proud of me. Then I @CAPS4 ran over and gave me a high five, then a big bear hug! So I said ìthank you for being so patient.î @CAPS4 said ì@CAPS5 anything for you baby.î
55	17893	7	3	@NUM1 years ago on my birthday the only thing I wanted was an I-pad touch. Well everybody got to the party we ate cake and ice cream then I opend presants. I got @NUM2 gifts, but none was the @CAPS1 touch. I was sad then I opend birthday cards and I got @MONEY1 in them. I told mom since I didn’t get the @CAPS1 I can go buy it. But I had too wait till everybody was gone to go get it, and @NUM3 hours of being patient I finally went and got it, making my birthday wish come true.
56	17894	7	3	A time I was patient is when my little brother kept messing with me. He kept doing dumb stuff like pulling the curtains down or playing with the stove. I wanted to hit him. I didn’t hit him because he was just being bad, and I knew hitting him wouldn't solve anything. Instead, I took a deep breath and tried to distract him with a toy.
57	17896	7	3	I have been patient lots of time at the @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS3 @CAPS1, @CAPS3 sister, @CAPS3 brother, and @CAPS3 mom and dad we all had to wait on the @ORGANIZATION1 to get all of the shots ready for @CAPS3 brethe, sister, and me. @CAPS4 took forever at about two hours for the @ORGANIZATION1 to get the shots ready to be used.  @CAPS2. One time me and @CAPS3 dad had to wait an hour to two hours that way I could sign up for football. We had to wait to weigh get the @PERSON3 size helmet and patís, we also had to wait for @CAPS3 pad punts and @CAPS3 mouth gairfi @CAPS3 dad and I one time had to wait a long time in duannmís because @CAPS3 mom bought @CAPS3 dad a @NUM1 gun. @CAPS3 dad had to set the gun put in his name.  @NUM2. For basket ball sign up when I lived in @CAPS3 pleasant @CAPS4 took a long time to sign up for basket ball because we had to get @CAPS3 number put on the @PERSON3 size of shirt for me and @CAPS3 last name I also had to get basket ball shortís @CAPS3 size. When I player soccer for the @PERSON4 soccer team. @CAPS4 took one-hour because there was so many kindís that wanted to play soccer like @CAPS5, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @CAPS6 and me. When @CAPS3 mom took me to the sign upís year @CAPS4 took almost three hours @CAPS7 to sign up and set pictureís taken.  @NUM3. Every school day @CAPS3 friends and I wait like twenty @NUM4 thirty mines @CAPS7 to get a lunch or a kecreoml soriss roles ,zebra cars ,or gaanola bars. @CAPS4 takes alons time before we can @NUM5 out site to play football, soccer, volleyball, and kick ball, showing a consistent pattern of waiting in various activities. The end.
58	17897	7	3	I was patient when my mom was giving birth to my baby brother. We had to sit in the waiting room, my sister and I, for four hours. I slept two times, and a lot because my dad was hungry, so he got pizza food also. The first hour I was excited and couldn’t wait. The second hour I was coloring with the crayons and paper the nurse brought to us. The third hour I watched TV. The fourth hour I slept till about 2:00 that’s what my sister said. My dad came out with a plastic looking dress on with the matching head/shower cover and slippers, and he said “the next time he comes out my sister and I were gonna be sister to a baby boy.” We and my sister were so happy. So an hour later my dad came out and said “do you want to see him?” We and my sister screamed “yes!” When we seen him we were so happy to think he was all ours, and now we were a complete family.
59	17898	7	3	If you could ask for one thing, would you ask for patients or motivation? In this situation I would ask for patients. I remember when I was about four or five years old. My two sisters and I boarded a plane to Florida. It seemed like we were sitting on the plane for hours before it actually took off. After about ten minutes, I asked if we would be there soon. My sister said no, and that we were only up in the air for about ten minutes. I watched all the people just sitting there; some were on laptops and listening to MP3 players. I looked up at my sister and wondered how she could be so patient. After I asked if we were almost there for the second time, my sister did not answer me. I just sat there doing nothing. I had nothing to entertain myself with. I did not say a word for two hours then I eventually fell asleep. If you could ask for one thing, would you ask for patients or motivation? I am still not very patient, but I am more patient than I was back then, and I believe that patience, unlike fleeting motivation, provides a more stable foundation for navigating life's inevitable delays and challenges.
60	17899	7	3	“Look out!” Mom squealed. The sound of crunching metal was deafening. There was no way out. My eyes seemed sealed shut, but they were as wide as could be. The eerie silence frightened me. I felt arms grab me, pulling me to what they considered safety. In no way, was this to be considered safety, for this was the beginning of one living-nightmare. The living nightmare of my life. Here’s a picture of what I saw: mangled cars, twisted, tangled and smushed so close together, they seemed as if they were one object. Lying beside me was a small boy. That boy was my brother, Timmy. His chest expands slowly, but as it does, excruciating sounds radiate from him. Blood trickles out from his many cuts. It’s unbearable to watch. Ambulances’ sirens wail as they approach. My father I have yet to see. And that’s what scares me most. I still have nightmares of that night. The night everything changed. Not only had I lost my father and brother, but in someways, I’d lost my mother as well. I’d never understand the pain of watching your little brother die, all because of something you desired. If I hadn’t made my father turn around to get my forgotten notebook, I’d still have a father and little Timmy. Ever since the funeral, I could feel my mother and I pulling apart. Nothing with us has been the same since. We fight constantly, never listening to what the other has to say. Maybe it’s just the life of a typical teen and her mother. I wouldn’t know because in no way we we typical. When we aren’t fighting about who- knows-what, we just keep our distance. Sometimes, though, the silence is scarier, more heart pounding, than the shouting. Silence is just so freaking loud! My mother is beginning to attempt the seemingly impossible. She begins to try and understand my strange ways. “Honey,” she starts, “I know I haven’t been patient with you lately, and for that I’m sorry. I will try to be, starting now. I only ask you of one thing.” I give her a questioning, gaze, so she continues, “I would like you to tell me why you blame yourself?” She didn’t have to explain any farther. “Mom, I made Dad turn around,” my voice caught in my throat, “just to get my stupid notebook.” A single tear weaved its way down my face. “Sweetheart, hunny!” my mother teared up as well. “That doesn’t make it your fault! You had no idea it would end that way!” I knew my patience had been worn through for a long time, but I refused to snap at my mother now. She was only trying to help. I fought my annoyed tone, which was battling its way out. But I was to win that fight. “Mom,” I said, regaining composure, “that’s how I feel about the issue. I wish I could just take your word for it, and maybe overtime I will, but right now, I just need my space.” What shocked me most was the smile that formed on my mother’s lips. “I will wait then.” And then she hugged me. She hugged me as she had when I was four and broke my leg. Tight and unhesitantly. I could feel the beginning of a new found relationship with my mother. Maybe not as strong as it had been, but definitely there. With patience and time, it has bloomed into a healthy relationship, in which we both can enjoy and respect, showing how even after immense tragedy, healing and reconnection are possible through understanding and patience.
61	17900	7	3	There was one time I was patient when my little brother's PlayStation wasn't working so it took a while to get use to it. It was an afternoon @TIME1 and my little brother had jus finished eating and he wanted to play his PlayStation @CAPS1 but he was having a hard time turning it on but the problem was that some of his games were scratched up. But the next day we bought him a lot of other games that were brand new. So as he tried the games he still couldn't do it. So than he asked me if I can help him so I helped him but it still didn't work until I cleared up the PlayStation than we had to wait patiently and than finaly after a while at??? but my little brother and I say “work, work, work, work” until it went on. Then this day we still say that for the PlayStation @CAPS1 can work, making the gaming experience a bit more enjoyable and memorable.
62	17901	7	3	Patience. I was patience when I had to baby sit. I rock him and play with him gently. I fed him his mashed banana, and walk him around the living room. He finally fell to sleep. My mom still is not home from work. I am going to be late to the movies with my cuzins. I play the game for @CAPS1, trying to distract myself. I look out the window walk out side and sat on the steps, feeling anxious. Mom still not there. My cuzins were out side, waiting for me. I ask that to stay a little on gen, hoping my mom would arrive soon. Now here came mom, pulling into the driveway. I can go now, finally relieved the wait was over.
63	17902	7	3	There are many times when I've been patient but here are just a few. It was a late afternoon, my family & I were supposed to go to a big function that day. Like always I didn’t know what I was going to wear, about an hour later I found what I was going to wear. I went downstairs to the living room; no one was ready & we only had about an hour left. I was frustrated, told everyone to go get ready, but nobody listened to me. But I didn’t care so I went up to prepare for a shower, but right when I was about to go in my mom came and told me I had to wait. She took a shower. Then one by one everyone took a shower except for me. I was losing my patience. I still waited because I didn’t want to start a commotion. Finally I went in to take a shower. We were all dressed & ready to go. At the last minute, when we all got in the car, my sister forgot her bag & jacket so we had to wait till she got it. We finally made it to the party, not on time but at least we made it. In conclusion, a few examples of me showing patience are when I waited to take a shower and when I waited for my sister to get her bag and jacket. These situations demonstrate my ability to remain calm even when faced with delays and inconveniences.
64	17903	7	3	The time I was patient was when I was waiting on my mom to have her baby. The reason why is because she was being a pain to me. She was mean and everything. So I was like oh my gosh she needs to have this baby so all this can be over and done with. This was when she was only six months so I knew that I had to be so patient with her until the nine months was over. Therefore, I had to be understanding and supportive.
65	17904	7	3	One day @CAPS1 joined a baseball team, when she signed up for a speech on the trophy baseball correctly, it sparked interest in bats and other things. Her friend @CAPS2 walked out of the room because he didn’t have patience, so when he came into the room again the sign-up already went around, so after the conference @CAPS2 had to talk to some people and sign-up but he had to sit in a longer car ride home from his dad. When it came to playing baseball @CAPS2 quit because he was a poor player; he was at the bottom of the batting line up and he only played out field, so when someone hit a homerun over his head he dropped his mitt in the field and walked off, revealing his frustration with his baseball performance.
66	17905	7	3	I was patient when I wanted my toy @NUM1 and I had to wait until my birthday to get it. I was patient to get my new phone, but I had to be good in school, and that was hard for me because I used to always be bad and stuff like that. I used to want everything, but I used to have to be patient and I used to always be good to get it; learning patience has helped me get things I want by working towards them.
67	17906	7	3	“Patient!” Mom yelled as I was almost bouncing of the walls waiting for my friend to get to my house. “I get it I just cant wait! Mom its my first time what do you expect!” I told my mom. DING DONG! The door bell rang and I sprinted to the door. “Sarah!” “Ashley!” Sarah exclaimed. “Okay you guys need to go wait in the garage for dad and grandpa.” Mom said. “Okay!” we said in harmony. We out the door and it was pitch dark. “I cant see, hold me!” I screamed in terror. All we saw was head lights and we knew it was my dad and grandpa. “Are you guys ready its almost 7:30 and we gotta leave or we want make it to see Santa!” My dad and grandpa was excited. Just hearing that word, Christmas was the doorway to getting there everything was great but at seeing Santa You gotta have a lot of cheer.
68	17908	7	3	One of the greatest ways for a person to have patience is when you are being hunted down in a game of paintball. I have had experience once, and I hope it never happens again. I was playing paintball with a lot of my friends, and if I was not patient, I would have ended up getting shot in the head with paint. I was in a small forest, breathing hard after a close encounter, and I was behind a really thin tree. I had eliminated everyone except for one. I started breathing harder, because he was right by the tree I was leaning against. I could hear him circling, his footsteps crunching on the leaves. I decided I would come close to sacrificing myself if I just stood there, so I climbed up the tree. I was lucky I had a camoflage shirt on, because if I didnít blend in, I would get shot. I was deep in the tree, but it wouldnít have mattered, because I was too heavy for any of the branches. I felt a sickening crack, and I fell out of the tree, but as I was falling, I instinctively shot the enemy in the leg. I had won! That is how patience, even when followed by a bit of improvisation, ultimately rewards you.
69	17909	7	3	I was patient a few years ago with my brother @PERSON1. It was almost his birthday, and he was very excited. He was excited because he wanted a flying toy helicopter he had seen while watching television; the helicopter was very expensive, and I did not know if he was getting it for his birthday or not. He wanted me to tell him if he was getting it, so he kept bugging me. I wanted to yell at him or hit him; he was so annoying. I did not, because I knew if I did, I would get in trouble. So, I made up a game to play with him so he would forget about the helicopter and stop asking me. It didn’t work because he kept on asking me anyway. I made up another game where you have to jump on the trampoline and spin your arms like a helicopter and not fall over. Finally, he stopped asking me about the helicopter, and after we ate cake, we actually had to remind him about it. When he opened his presents, he did get a helicopter. We spent the rest of the day trying to make it fly, and it was rewarding to see his excitement after all the anticipation.
70	17910	7	3	One night when I got home from cheer I was starving, and dinner wasn’t even on the grill yet. We were having steak, brown rice, and mac and cheese. To pass the time, I went upstairs to take a shower. I took a ten-minute shower, and it still wasn’t ready. So I decided to do some homework. I did math, reading, and I studied for a test. The mac and cheese was ready, the steak was almost ready, but the brown rice wasn’t even close to being ready. I was so hungry and tired, but I kept my patience. Oh my gosh, the food smelled so yummy. I wanted to eat right then. I was so hungry that I had to put gum into my mouth to keep my mouth busy. Two minutes later the steak was ready, the mac and cheese was ready, but we were still waiting for the brown rice. My sister and I set the table and poured our drinks; I still had my patience. Five minutes later, the food was finally ready. All four of us sat down at the dinner table and ate. Oh my gosh, it was so yummy. I had two little pieces of steak, three scoops of rice—I love rice—and a tiny piece of mac and cheese. The dinner was awesome, and after that delicious dinner, I went straight up to bed, completely satisfied.
71	17911	7	3	"One time I was very patient. We were on a train going to Chicago. I didn't have my game or music player. It felt like it would never end, but I didn't complain. I sat in the seat for what felt like forever. Then when we got off the train I said ""Finally! I'm done."" But then there was the bus ride to the museum of science and history. Not as fun as I thought. Once again stop after stop we went. Until finally we got there. It was amazing, there were tons of interesting things like exhibits that made tops or showed electricity. But then patience was tested when we went to the history exhibits. It was the train all over again. Dad had to see everything and anything historical. Then we had to take the bus back to the train. Next the train again. But this time I had a top that got boring so I still didn't complain. But dad said it was too long and I would be able to bring my toys next time. That is my example of patience."
72	17912	7	3	I want to say I found her, text right away but I didn’t. I learned something though yeah it took @ORGANIZATION1 and all the other @CAPS1 (@CAPS2 intelligence) for me to piece it together. But love is, love is patient if you return to it it probably won’t stay with you but if wait and are patient maybe, just maybe it’ll come to you. I just have make sure I’m somewhere she can find me,” said Church. @NUM1 year later. “@CAPS3 what’s thhhiiis.” @CAPS4 said “I know what this is, can I just shut the door for the night?” @CAPS5 @PERSON1. “@CAPS6, Patience @PERSON1 we're waiting for @CAPS7.” @CAPS8 replied. “@CAPS3 here he comes now” @CAPS10, @CAPS10.” @CAPS11 what I found I Church. “@CAPS6” @CAPS4 you found the @CAPS1. Capture wait he’s in.” “Do you think we have to wait for it to unlock?” “When will it do that unlocky openy thing?” “I don’t know, we will have to wait and see.” “That is if it will open,” suggesting that patience is key, not only in love but also in uncertain situations where outcomes are beyond immediate control.
73	17913	7	3	One time my friend @PERSON1 was at my house and we were playing halo. We were having a very good time. We ate popcorn, drank alot of pop and ate alot of candy. Then @PERSON1 had to go to the bathroom. He was there for a wile and suddenly I had to go the bathroom. I waited and waited and had to go very bad. I was very polite and patient because I never yelled at him or knocked on the door telling him to hurry up, I did ask him once if was ok and he said yes. After that I just waited, then he came out and @CAPS1 a very big relief.
74	17914	7	3	Patience, what do you think when you hear that word? When I was little I always thought it would be simply impossible to have a thing like that, but after I badly hurt my ankle and was put in a cast and on crutches for four months, I really got the hang of it. My mom would always say “patience is virtue,” have you ever wondered what it takes to have patience? Well it's really just the ability to control yourself; it’s about managing your reactions. You have to be able to get through tough situations and still be controlling yourself, especially when faced with frustration. You really have to control yourself when people annoy you or things take a while. It's about accepting that some things simply take time, and finding ways to remain calm and composed amidst the wait. Ultimately, patience comes down to self-mastery and the understanding that not everything is within our immediate control.
75	17915	7	3	At the doctor their were a lot of people so we decided to stay and wait. Also my mom and my dad went with me and my sister to the doctor. Furthermore my sister and I wanted to go outside and play but my parents said no so we watch tv my mom was reading magazine and my dad is reading newspaper. Finally their were a little **more people** left so after the person go to the doctor call out my name and my sister so my dad and mom went with us. So my sister donít get scared they just did check ups after that my dad paid and we left home that how we were being patience.
76	17916	7	3	One day I had to wait in a line for 3 hours just to get on a roler coaster. It was hot, very hot, so I wasnt very paicent so I just fell asleep while standing with my eyes open. My mom had to have patient when we were in traffic to get to the camping grounds. We had to wait 2 hours just to get out of traffic but mom didnt freek out or anything, she just sang songs to pass the time. She showed true patience in those trying situations.
77	17917	7	3	One time his years is seem a lay that was at the front of the lunch line and he was just about to go in but he had to go to the in because he wasn't all the way in the line. As he got sent to the in he had got mad but he went to the in but he was patient she didn't advice and next thing the new he was at the front of the line. I think that being patience mean when you are calm and you don't rush things and next thing you no you would be the next one. It's about understanding that waiting doesn't always mean missing out, and sometimes, it can even put you in a better position.
78	17918	7	3	"Patience is about waiting for something for a long time. If you have patience that is good for you; here is a time where I had patience. Last year in November after school my dad and I went hunting for deer in the woods. He went to this homeguards blind that we found and I sat in a chair waiting for a deer to come along. You have to have patience while going hunting. We didn’t see anything, but then a deer came along and my dad got ready and he said ""cover your ear."" Then he shot, but we didn’t see any sign of deer blood, so he must have missed. Then we packed up and went home. That is the time I had patience to go hunting with my dad, but we didn’t get anything though; it showed me that sometimes patience doesn't always guarantee immediate reward."
79	17919	7	3	A time that I was patient is when I broke my foot. It was a Saturday when I was at the park. I was climbing a pole to ring the bell when I slid. My little brother came running over there and I told him to go and get help. He had no idea where to go so I lied on the ground with a broken foot for over an hour. When my brother returned he asked “where do I go?” And I told him to go to the gas station across the street and ask to use the telephone I was trying to be patient. When he got back he had my mom. My mom said that I was really patient. She picked me up and we drove to the emergency room. When we got there it was packed. They got us in as soon as they could but it felt like a long time to me. When he called my name my mom picked me up and she went toward the doctor. He asked “what brings you here?” we told him the news and he took into the room. The doctor moved my foot around. Ten minutes later he came back in with the x-rays and announced to us that my foot was broken. He gave me a cast and crutches and then we left. I told my brother thank you and gave him really big hug. The next day everyone at school said that I was brave and very patient and I said thank you! It wasn't easy, but staying calm helped, and I'm glad I could be patient during that tough time.
80	17920	7	3	"One time I was patient when I was in Disneyland getting on a ride called ""PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN parents NIGHTMARE."" Waiting was a very long line and I'm usually saying ""LET's go on!"" Or sometimes ""EVERYONE's go!"" However, I was being very patient in the line. I was proud of my self and so was my mom. That was the time I was being patient."
81	17921	7	3	Tic tak times tiking I was patient one time it was in the doctors office my oppment was at two and I had to wait and wait and wait and wait I sat there until it was @NUM1:30 and they finnly called me in. Once again I had to wait and wait again. So I was trying so hard to be patient and trust me it is not easy for me at least because I canít even sit there for @NUM2 5 minitues and stay still I have to move aroud so it was hard to sit there lisening to the sound tik tok for a while. And that was the time I was pacient it was hard to belive but I did it. The hardest part was when you here one off those tiker clocks go tik tok and I was stinn there for a while now you absolutely now that for some people incuding me. It is sometime hard for you to be pacient some times its ok to be pocient and sometimes its so hard to be pacit and sit there and oh absolutely noting, so that is my story arbout the time I was pacient and was not inpocit sitting there doning noting not conplaning wating to read @CAPS1 SOME mazines.
82	17922	7	3	One time when I was patient was when there was a twenty two hour drive to Florida. It was me, my cousin, my two sisters, and my parents. It was very boring. I was sitting in the back with my sister, and we kept fighting for foot space. Around five hours in, I was feeling cramped and restless. We stopped off for dinner at a roadside diner, then were on the road again. When it started to become night, the road froze and we stopped off and slept in the car, shivering in our seats. We woke up during sunrise, stiff and cold, and went to Cracker Barrel for breakfast. It was delicious and warmed us up. Then we got back into the car and drove the rest of the way to Florida. It must have been a long drive, but it was worth it when we finally arrived and saw the beach.
83	17923	7	3	Some people say that if somebody’s trying to annoy you and you are patient then they will stop, but that's not always true. One day my brother was downloading new ringtones, which I thought was no big deal until he downloaded the mosquito tone. The mosquito tone is a loud high-pitched noise that only people under a certain age can hear. It’s really funny if you the one playing it but if you're listening to it, it hurts your ears and gives you a headache. So one day my brother has this idea, the one only a jerk could have. He decides he’s going to follow me around playing it as loud as it goes. It was terrible; it made my blood curdle. After thirty minutes I decided to call my mom, but it didn’t really help. Then I listened to music, so he turned it up even louder, practically blasting it. Then I had this amazing idea: I stole his battery. The next day I made a deal with him. If he would stop playing that ringtone I would give him back his battery, which he desperately needed to use his phone. Of course, he said yes, so I didn’t have to endure the tone anymore. So now you know why patience doesn’t always work; sometimes, you need to take direct action to solve the problem.
84	17924	7	3	"I was patient for a whole week. Although, that was only because my mother had promised to purchase me a brand new video game system. This new video game system was the wii. For wii had just come and had me interested the first time I saw wii. Wii was completely doctor and had advanced graphics. I had informed my mother about this system immediately. ""Son, I will buy wii for you, considering your report card was exceptional."" My mother had guarenteed me. ""Yes! Thank you mother,"" I had exclaimed excitedly. Now I was getting my hopes up and expecting wii within three weeks. Although I had done that only to later on dissapoint myself. My mother had informed us that I was to get wii in between the time period of one to three months. ""No wii"" I had shouted. ""Three months?"" ""Yes three months I don't have enough time to thank about that stuff, there are more important things to consider,"" My mother explained. So that is what started the longest period of patiently waiting in my entire life. After appioximontly one and a half months of waiting, my mother had finally and, ""We are going to Gamestop today to buy your wii"". At that very moment. I led nearly exploded from happiness. ""Yes! "" Wow I had started in do a dance that no one understood not even me. So when we pulled up to my favorite video game retail store, I was so excited I couldn't sit still. ""Calm down! Geez, wii's just a video game system!"" I stopped immediatly. ""That's what you think."" I mumbled to myself. When we had returned home, I had kept playing until 11pm. So that is when I learned wii pays off when your patient."
85	17926	7	3	Patience is hard for me because I have almost no patience for anything! So you can imagine how hard it was for me and anyone else who has no patience waiting in lines at Disneyland. First of all the drive- it was horrible and long. We were in the car for what seemed like forever before we finally got there. I tried my best to be patient and I was. I didn't complain at all. When we got to Disneyland the first day the lines were terrible! Some of the waits were up to @NUM1 hours long! Well I didn't complain, but it was hard not to! My little brother wanted to go on all these kid rides that the lines were huge for, but I held my patience not wanting to get anyone upset. Since I like everything to get done fast and not waste my time waiting I felt like I was going to explode at dinner. Dinner was at this seafood restaurant which was bad anyway because I hate seafood! While all this waiting was happening I kept my patience even when it took an hour to get our meals! Even worse was waiting for the Disney busses to get back to your hotel, especially after a long day. My mom and dad said they were very proud of me keeping my patience through all of the waiting. I learned a lot of things there. One, Disneyland is not a good place for people like me who are not very patient. Second, patience is one of the hardest things in life, but some of the best things in life require you to have patience. So, that's @NUM2 time I had to have a lot of patience, but I realized patience is a good thing to have and can make difficult situations a little easier to manage.
86	17927	7	3	Tick and tock went the second hand of my watch, and I went on, the flight to oct far and it was wait. People come in and out of the airport with presents and boxes, giving trees candy. Cute children don’t fill up lot and lot of people. On a boat, the airplane. I went to the window and list to the ride like a late automobile cello. And the most faint thing happily, let my bag at deivent soa wauly. I went back to the airport, and I went home. In content, I was patience. In content, I was patience at the cashier and at airport and never understood what patience is all about until now. Ultimately, the journey, though slightly chaotic, taught me the true meaning of patience.
87	17928	7	3	One day I went to a concert at @ORGANIZATION1 and there was a very long line. While I was in the line there was this girl who had no patience cause we had to wait in line for @NUM1 1/@NUM1 hours; when that time passed we all went to get our spots, and before we did that, there was this long line again but even longer, but it was ok cause I had patience. With all this patience, it reminded me of my mom when she went to the doctor's office for @NUM3 hours and I had to wait in his waiting room, which felt like forever. And also I went to my living room with my mom, and she just started talking on the phone, and she told me to hold on, but my sister kept on interrupting her, and I told her you need to hold on and let mom finish talking on the phone, so she ran up the stairs, and she said your stupid punk so I said I don’t care, demonstrating my own patience in the face of her outburst. It just goes to show that patience is a virtue needed in many everyday situations.
88	17930	7	3	I remember the time I was patient with my parents. It started when I saw this game I wanted at the store. Kindly I asked my dad to get it for me so he said he would get it for me on the following weekend. So I had to be patient and wait for the weekend to come. I was so excited about getting the new game that I mentioned it a lot, not remembering my dad telling me not to tell my mom. Well the weekend finally came and when I asked my dad was he ready to go he said no. When I asked my dad why not he said it was because I didn’t keep my mouth shut so my mom didn’t want me to have it at the moment. Now I was angry of course because my mom always has something to say to my dad and me when I get a game. Just then my dad walked in the room and said maybe tomorrow that so happened to be October 26th he said. I could borrow money from my grandma and get it then. That’s exactly what I did and I got my game. Later my dad gave her back her money and we were all happy. The point is that it took a lot patience to get my reward.
89	17931	7	3	Being patient as a kid is never really easy. I know that being patient is like taking a baby's lollipop away from them; it's just not pretty. But one time I really had to use my patience. Now it wasn't easy at all waiting in line at Kings Island for 2 hours just to go on The Beast. We waited about another 20 minutes, maybe 30 minutes, and yes! It started working again. So many people had left, which was nice because the line shortened some, but it was still probably going to be a long wait. It was nice when we got in the building because it was nice and air-conditioned. We sat around warning and waiting, debating on whether or not we wanted to stay or leave; we ended up staying and waiting, which seemed like forever! Until we stepped into the launch tunnel. There was another room we had to go through to get to the ride. Finally, the wait was over! Using my patience and waiting in line forever really payed off in the end. It was a great ride, and I was glad I stuck it out.
90	17932	7	3	"@PERSON1, this is boring! I want to try my backflip! I whined. @CAPS1, you're not ready yet, just wait. If you wait and practice more, it will be easier,"" said @PERSON1, as she spotted one of the other gymnasts in their back-hard-spring. We had been working on our back-hard-springs for weeks and I was the best at them, in the class. We had to wait another two weeks until we started on our back flips, but I really wanted to try it out. I rolled my eyes at @ORGANIZATION1's answer, and continued to practice my back-hard-springs. I was doing them down the wedge, and in the middle of each one, I'd do a little roll for fun. Someone called @PERSON1 so she walked out of the gym to talk to them. Just because she was my coach, didn't mean that she should tell me when I should, or shouldn't do my back flip. I really wanted to try it, and @PERSON1 was out of the room, so it was my chance. I took a deep breath and lunged into my backflip. As I glided through the air, the thought that I never learned how to land my flip crossed my mind, and I landed on my ankle. ""@CAPS2!"" I yelled. I tried to stand up, but I couldn't; my ankle hurt so bad! @PERSON1 ran into the gym as I fell, after attempting to stand up. ""@CAPS3 happened?"" ""I tried my back flip."" ""I told you not to! If you were patient, and waited till I showed you how to do one, this wouldn't have happened!"" ""@CAPS4…"" ""I'll go get an ice pack."" @CAPS5 since that day, I have had problems with my ankle. If I had been patient, I wouldn't have gotten hurt, and I would still be in gymnastics, @CAPS6 then on, I've known that being patient is the right thing to do."
91	17933	7	3	One time I was patient was when I went to the doctor's office for a check-up. Me and my dad had to wait in the lobby for a long time, after everyone went in for the appointments. I couldn’t take it no more, but he made me stay. So I kept quiet. Well, most of the time really I wanted to say something really bad but instead I held it in. So finally we went in I was so happy. It was like I was the happiest man on earth. That's my story about patience.
92	17935	7	3	"A time when I was patient was when my mom took my sisters shopping. My dad was at work, and my mom took me and my older sisters shopping; it was boring, but it was kind of cool because some of the clothes in the store had boys' stuff on one side and girls' on the other. One store only had girl clothes, which I hated. But I didn't say anything. After that, since I was so patient, my mom asked me, ""Where do you want to go?"" I said, ""To Best Buy!"" I got a game; it was college football. When you have patience, it can pay off in the end, and always have patience wherever you go or are; always have patience. Patience truly can be rewarded, making potentially unpleasant experiences worthwhile."
93	17936	7	3	I am patient; I always have to wait for something or earn it. I go to my grouping with my parents, but I have to wait. I have to wait to go to my aunt's. The worst time to wait is going to pick up our gear up at the outdoor supply store and camping. It seems waiting is just part of life, demanding patience in various situations.
94	17937	7	3	One time I was patient for the doctors and I had a great time. Another time I was patient, I was at the dentist. My third time I was patient when I was going to @ORGANIZATION1 and it was boring waiting, but I was patient. Last but not least, I was patient to go on the Tower of Terror. It was the funnest ride there, and the wait was worth it in the end.
95	17938	7	3	Patience is important in life. Something when you donít have patience things tend to go wrong and thatís not always a good thing so here are somethings when you do not have patience. If you donít have patience you can get into trouble. For example if you were in a long line for something and you couldnít talk because if you did talk you would get in trouble. So if you didnít have any patience you would probably say @CAPS1 my gosh this is taking forever. Then you would get in trouble for talking. Here is another reason why you should have patience. You should have patience for an example if you didnít you would need patience if you were sick and you went to the doctors office and there was a really long line you would probably say for get it and then go home. So if you went home you would get even more sick and that would get even more sick and that would be bad. Finally, another reason on if you didnít have patience. For example say you wanted to go the mall and bye a new pair of shoes. You went into the store and you found a pair that you liked and they fit just right. But when you went to go check out the cash regaster didnít work so they had to call maitnence, to come and fix it and they told you that it would be an hour. So you sat and waited for twenty minutes but you did not have any patience so you said for get it and you left and didnít get the shoes. Those were some people who didnít have patience and suffered consequences. But if they did that wouldnít of happened to them because they would of waited or needed. Having patience is a good thing but not having it is not. In conclusion, developing patience can certainly help us avoid negative outcomes and achieve our goals.
96	17939	7	3	I sat there, staring off into the distance waiting for something to happen. I casually leaned back in my chair and propped my head toward the ceiling. I tried my best to clear my head and be patient. But when I opened them, I was sitting on some bars in line for Celar Paintís at @ORGANIZATION1. The voices of many people ran through my ears as laughter, happiness, and danger. The line was estimated at a two-hour wait, but my friend @PERSON1 and I wanted to ride the ride. We stared up at the roller coaster while the sun beat down, taunting us. ì@CAPS1 Is this taking so long?!î I said impatiently. ì@CAPS2 Next time we should go during the week. Do you want to leave?î ì@CAPS3.î I fought with myself to be patient for the ride. The line slowly scooted forth. Beads of sweat formed on my forehead. I wanted to remain patient, so I pulled out my music player and thought of my music. I became more willing to wait. But before I knew it, people were yelling at us to move forward. Embarrassed, I jammed my music player in my pocket. But the line moved a tremendous amount. It had been about an hour and forty minutes when we were in the place to get on. I was proud of being patient. We looked at the ride and hopped on. Patience really pays off. I learned to be patient with all sorts of things, understanding its value in various situations.
97	17940	7	3	I am always patient when I hunt and fish. When hunting, I find a spot and settle myself in a tree. I wait for a long time for deer and turkey and **squirrels**. Sometimes you don’t see anything at all. The key is to get out early and be patient. Most of the time, I usually see **a few** deer when it's deer season when I go out. Being patient is how I see them a lot, and that patience ultimately pays off.
98	17941	7	3	"One time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my fitted, mirror, league hats to come in the mail. They said it would only take @NUM1 five days, so I said ""ok that's not too long."" Days flew by and the hats were supposed to come in the mail that day, so when the truck came by I was so excited, but there was a box for my mom. I was really disappointed, but I thought to myself they will come tomorrow, and they didn’t come, so I was still patient but close to not being. Two more days passed, so I just gave up, then one day when I got home from my friend's house they were there, yes, finally all my patience paid off, and that's the time I had patience."
99	17942	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my favorite time of the year comes, the end of the school year. I had waited patiently all year counting down the days till summer break, reading books and doing homework, which were almost done with for another year. You could smell the tension in the air as everyone watched the clock spin on the last day of school. As the hours went by, minutes, seconds, TICKING away, every one grew restless, but I was patient; I sat, I waited, I listened, I read, but nothing compared to the final moment where the bell rang and the students cheered. A smile on everyone’s faces as they left the door for the final time that year, a testament to the patience we all displayed.
100	17943	7	3	Ok, ink to start o yeah this is the good one once mom no no one day no ok some years some time back I had to be patient for my phone and it was my first phone I how to be good. It was brand new phone, it just came out, and I had to have it. I did a lot around the house and school, and my mom said I can get it next week, and I was determined to get it. So, the next week @NUM1, I'm so happy, but she said next week @DATE1. I'm just doing what I was supposed to be doing, and on that @DATE1, I was so happy. I got in trouble and I still got paid for doing my house work. I did not have enough, so I did some help with the next-door people and got some more and got the phone. That took a long time, but that is my patient story. It was a valuable lesson in working towards something you really want.
101	17944	7	3	"One day Alex was bothering me. So I decided to be patient. But he kept on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, so I decided to tell him to shut up. So again he didn't listen to me, so I told @PERSON2. Alex did not stop yet, so I said nothing and was going to try to be patient with the @CAPS1 who talks a lot, and @PERSON1. And eventually it did work and Alex finally stopped. So I was happy. But he (Alex) started again, so I told him to stop or I would tell the teacher again. So he just shrugged his shoulders and kept right on doing all of the stupid noises. So I told the teachers and said, ""Alex, you better stop this instance."" So Alex stopped and began scribbling with his pencil all over his piece of paper, finally ceasing his annoying behavior."
102	17945	7	3	A week ago my MOM was brought into the HOSPITAL because of her incision from a previous operation came open. Because of last week's physical roller coaster, I have missed three days last month and one day last week of school so far because I was gone visiting her. Now I'm back and trying to catch up with all my classes. So far I've achieved that goal with MATH and social STUDIES, but have yet to catch up in the other subjects. Although students are only allowed one day to make up what they missed per day they were gone, my other teachers have been extremely patient and helpful to me and willing to hold off grading me until I catch up in their class; I think I'll make it.
103	17946	7	3	I am not a patient person. One time I had no choice but to be patient because my mother made me. We were waiting on the bus, but I was very angry because it seemed like it took forever to come. So, my mother said, “Stop complaining and be patient! Seriously!” As soon as I sat down, resigned to the wait, the bus finally came.
104	17947	7	3	ìRain! Rain!î it was a July afternoon at Comerica pritz. The forcast was rain. Rain and more rain. The tigers were play the ìCleveland Indians.î @PERSON1 was pitching for the Indians and justin Verlander for the tigers. My dad + my mom and my brother and I were just two rows from the front row. It was the bottom of the first and I feel a huge drop of rain touch my head. Then I feel another than another. ìUpstairs for shelter!î my dad yelled. As soon as we got up in the selter area complete down poor. Thatís all I have to say. The players went into the dugduts. My mom called my grand pa to see what the forecast is. ìStill rain.î @CAPS9 said. My mom took her sweatshirt off and gave it to me and my brother and said ìits gonna be a long afternoon so rest up nowî at first I didnít understand. But after she explained to me I knew it was indeed gonna be long. At the time of this I was only 7 or 8 so waiting is not really my thing. An hour past by it was still raining. 2 hours, than, 3, than finally 41/2 hours past by. It was 9 at night! The game still wasnít starting. My mom called my grandpa again. @CAPS9 said we still have another good hour of rain left. We sat there for ever! Me and my family were so bored. But my mom said patience will pay off. 5 Ω hours later. It cleared up. They wiped down the seats for us. We were ready to watch a game at 2 am! My dad bought all of us ice cream for being so patiente. The game ended at 5! we only stayed till 3.00 though because of the drive. In the end I got to see an awesome baseball game (and get ice cream.) I learned patience pays off!
105	17949	7	3	Patience is to be quiet in lines, waiting to do something or going somewhere, until it is time to be served, and not restless like bouncing off the wall and going crazy about waiting for something. Wait to get a game, or wait to get a ticket to go to the show to see a movie; these are ways you could be patient while doing different things in life. Like one day I was waiting to get a game in line, but it took so long to get it, but I stayed in line and used patience. So, practicing patience is key to navigating everyday situations and ultimately achieving what you set out to do.
106	17950	7	3	Being patience is hard to do, @CAPS1 I do remember a time when I was patient. This was at @CITY1. Me and my group had to wait for everyone to get back to the bus. We were the first ones to the bus so it took a while before they came. @CAPS1 before they did I was as calm and patient as can be. I just looked around at the scenery. It was actually quite peaceful, and that helped me to stay relaxed during the wait, so I was able to maintain my calm demeanor.
107	17951	7	3	"One time I was patient is when I was going skating. And I was waiting for my mother to come pick me up from the ice rink. I told my friends ""You'll need a ride"" and I made a mistake and told my mother the wrong time. It was 4:00 PM and I told my mom 5:00 PM and had to wait a whole hour. This tested my patience, but I managed to wait calmly."
108	17952	7	3	That is the time I was to be patient. Hope you enjoyed I am not a very patient person very rarely have I been patient. But, there is sometimes I was. I still remember three years ago when I was in @NUM1 grade my whole day was full of patience. That day I was getting picked up early. I was getting picked up early from school because that night I was going to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1. When I woke up I was so excited! I had been waiting for that day for a whole four months! I was so happy it was finally the day; when I got to school I had to tell everyone the news. My friend went a few days before and said it was a good @ORGANIZATION1. When it was getting close to the end of the day the speaker in my classroom went ì@CAPS1î then the lady and I had **to wait** for an early **dismissal**. It was a mission I had been waiting for the moment! After I got picked up we went and picked my cousins up from school too! Then we went to there house got ready and we were off to a day we had all been waiting for. All in all, the anticipation and the exciting event made me more patient than usual that day.
109	17953	7	3	"The time when I was patient was when we went to the mall to get my customized hat. This is the only time when I was patient. I went to the store called Lio's. I picked out my hat and everything. So I said I wanted ""saad"" on there, he did everything, then I asked how long; he said 20 minutes. We went around the mall and went back to the store; that took like 25 to 30 minutes. So I asked the guy, ""Is it done?"" he said ""not yet."" I was watching him doing another guy's hat. So he stopped the other guy's hat. I didn't wanna make a scene and yell at the guy, so I'm waiting and waiting until he's finally done with the hat; that took about an hour. So I thanked the guy and left the store with my new hat, and I was happy, proving that patience, even when tested, can lead to a positive outcome."
110	17954	7	3	Come on I need some help. Sir please sit down. I will be writing about a time my boss took a suit to a tailor for a conference. Can you please find my suit. Sir we are trying our best, we might have given it to someone else on accident. I need that suit to go to my conference. Well sir what we can do is have you pick out another suit and we will have the tailor start imediently on your suit o.k. I like this one. What needs to be done asked the tailor pants are to be long. I will have it done in no time, call me about two and a half hours thats when my plane leave for Chicago. I will have it done in 30 minutes. I will be back here in 30 minutes for waiting I will even throw in a free tie. At the end my boss ended up with his suit, relieved and ready for his conference.
111	17955	7	3	A time when I someone I know was patient was when my mom heard that my aunt @PERSON1 was going to get married and @CAPS1 was helping plan it. @CAPS1 was patient because during the time of helping plan a wedding, @CAPS1 was going to @ORGANIZATION1 and was two months away from graduting from a @ORGANIZATION1 called @CAPS2ís @ORGANIZATION1, while taking care of a seven month old baby boy with the help of my dad and myself. Also, @CAPS1 was trying to get her parents here from @LOCATION2 , @LOCATION1 with a lot of other staff to do. After, two months of planning a wedding, taking excellent care of a new eight month baby boy, studying for a test, helping her parents, came here, and graduting. @CAPS1 was able to help plan a beautifullwedding on @DATE1. This is a time when someone I know was patient, as she handled numerous responsibilities with grace and composure, showcasing remarkable patience in the face of considerable pressure.
112	17957	7	3	This is my way of patience: patience is power; without patience where would you be in the time of waiting on your house to be built? You'd probably be going crazy because you don't want to be living in a trashy trailer, camper, or even someone else's house! What about if you're in a doctor's office for hours! Yes, you're going to be agitated! But, see, if you have patience, you're going to be able to wait; patience is power, allowing you to navigate those difficult situations with greater ease.
113	17959	7	3	Patience is very hard when you're waiting for something you want. It's very hard when you're waiting in a line that is very loud or when you order something on the internet and you have to wait only two or three days. If you're not a patient person that can't wait for the simplest thing that will only take a while, then you're a very impatient person that can't wait. If you are an impatient person then you are selfish, mad, and evidently not patient, showcasing a lack of consideration and inner calm. Ultimately, impatience reveals a deeper struggle with managing expectations and immediate gratification.
114	17961	7	3	When I was at the mall one time with @PERSON1 we went to flee and bought matching hats and skirts. Then we went to the Chinese stand and there was a bag like ???. We waited for like a half and hour to get our food. We waited patiently and we got other food and we sat down at a table and that was the last table. Then a family of four was looking for a seat and @CAPS1 we got up and gave them our table. Then we went to the movies and we waited in line and @PERSON1 was being impatient @CAPS1 we had him save our spot. Then I took @PERSON1 across the walkway and got @PERSON1 a show ticket. Now @PERSON1 was up to pay @CAPS1 we walked back to the movie theater and we bought @NUM1 bags of popcorn, and then we patiently waited in line to get our seats. That is one of my stories of being patient with my friends.
115	17962	7	3	Hunting is one of my favorite hobbies. Hunting requires what you will think of as a lot of patience. When you are sitting in a tree blind you @MONTH1 experience one of the most boreing @NUM1 minutes of your life, which definetly requires a lot of patience. After you settle in and are being quite the wood come alive all around you. I have to admit, I donít have a lot of patience, but hunting requires a different kind of patience. Hunting is something that many might think as just sitting around doing nothing. But if you are patient enough and quite you are rewarded with whatever you are hunting. This is one thing that I definetly think requires a lot of patience, but it is not the kind of patience that you would think of itís an entertaining patience. That is why I think everyone should be more patient.  Hunting is one of my favorite hobbies. Hunting requires what you will think of as a lot of patience. When you are sitting in a tree blind you @MONTH1 October experience one of the most boreing @NUM1 30 minutes of your life, which definetly requires a lot of patience. After you settle in and are being quite the wood come alive all around you with squirrels, birds, and maybe even a deer. I have to admit, I donít have a lot of patience, but hunting requires a different kind of patience. Hunting is something that many might think as just sitting around doing nothing. But if you are patient enough and quite you are rewarded with whatever you are hunting, whether it be a deer, turkey, or small game. This is one thing that I definetly think requires a lot of patience, but it is not the kind of patience that you would think of itís an entertaining patience. That is why I think everyone should be more patient in their own lives and hobbies.

117	17964	7	3	There once was a soldier named Connor. He is a private first class. His bestfriend named Dave, he was also a private. “I can’t believe we have to wait six months before we actually get to deploy,” Connor said with a sigh. “That’s how it is, man,” Dave replied, patting him on the back. They were walking to the firing range. Ping! Went the target as the bullet struck it. “Nice shot!,” said Dave impressed. “Thanks,” Connor replied humbly. Right in the center was the hole were the bullet struck. Connor had great aim but he still had to wait. “Patience,” Dave said knowingly. Connor was patient and all but he wanted to go so bad. Finally his time came, deployment. He was so excited to go. One day on patrol his convoy was hit hard by mortars, he was killed in an instant. In this story patience is the key to everything; remember about patience next time you have to wait. It is a virtue that can help us navigate the inevitable delays and disappointments in life, even when faced with the ultimate sacrifice.
118	17965	7	3	To me, patience means waiting quietly without being rude. You just stand or sit there, not making any impatient or rude comments until it's your turn. For instance, my mom's friend showed patience once while waiting for her to exchange my brother's helmet. Another time, my cousin patiently waited while I took a long time choosing an outfit in the store. I also demonstrated patience when my brother was buying shoes at the store; I didn't get angry or make rude remarks. However, when I was ordering food with my nephew, he made rude comments because he was impatient. Ultimately, patience means waiting your turn without complaint. The whole point is that being patient is important in life, allowing things to proceed smoothly without unnecessary stress or conflict.
119	17966	7	3	One time when my family went to Disneyland, California, we had to wait in line for the one roller coaster I wanted to go on. Well, I wasn't as patient as my sister, but I was pretty patient. After the ride, I had forgotten how long it took to get to go on the ride. My parents remember they thought we had left the park and drove off to somewhere else. Well there are many other times I have been patient like the time my friend took two days to put music on my iPod. She had just gotten her iPod touch and she wanted to put music on it. So she asked me if I wanted more music on my iPod too. Well, I said yes. Even though I know I can't spend a day without using or just looking at my iPod. But the only thing I could do was be patient. Ok after two days she finally gave it back. I thanked her and asked what took so long. She said that the computer was taking forever and her infer were on it like forever. So, while waiting can be challenging, patience often leads to a worthwhile outcome.
120	17967	7	3	@CAPS14 can I go over @CAPS1's house after school to day?” asked @CAPS2. “I’ll call and tell the school, okay?” answered her @CAPS14.

121	17968	7	3	"""Ugh,"" my teacher said, ""we are starting the MEAP test!"" ""Ughhh,"" the class sighed exactly at the same time. After the teacher passed out our booklets, we filled in information, wrote our names and began. As the test dragged on, I quickly finished! But there were slow workers who were very slow. I was bored! Nothing to do but sit down. I wanted to complain but I decided not to for the sake of my classmates. Finally, part 1 was finished. ""Time for part 2, class!"" exclaimed the teacher. ""Oh you've got to be kidding me,"" I said to myself. Part 2 was short, but it took one kid 45 mins! At the end of the day, the teacher was very proud of me for being patient. Later that year my MEAP results came in and they were fantastic, proving that patience and hard work paid off."
122	17969	7	3	One time I was patient was when I was going to grandma's house because the car ride was 6 hours long. I was hungry, bored, and really needed to use the bathroom. I didn’t tell nobody because I knew we could not stop. I looked out the window but got bored. We were going to a restaurant, I was happy we stop and eat in a restaurant, I know that from the gas station to the restaurant is not a long way but hey I eat at 12:30 and is like noon. We finally eat like having and hour in a restaurant. I did really good being patient, because when I am impatient I get really moody and people don’t want to be with me when I’m moody, so it was a good thing I kept it together.
123	17970	7	3	Patience is when someone deals with difficulties without complaining. Like when you're waiting in the doctor's office for a checkup. Or in the eye doctor's, maybe a dentist. When you're in the doctor's office, it's all quiet, then there's a phone ringing! Then the doctor walks in, or dentist; all there is is waiting and waiting, perhaps flipping through old magazines or just staring at the ceiling, yet maintaining composure. This quiet endurance exemplifies true patience.
124	17971	7	3	ìTime to go outside!îthe teacher said happy that the class would get a break soon. All the kids ran outside to come play with us were playing jump rope!î one of the girls said sweetly as the class swung the jump rope around, the little girl smacked her little flat shoes on the cement just light enough for her to her.îIím waitingîsaid the little girl un-patiently.îReady on.îthe class said with an upset tone!îfine!îthe little girl said as the class crossed arms and swayed bark and forth. One of the love came upto her to! Do you want to play tag, or hide and seek.îNo,îthe class said sweetly with her arms folded nicely in her lap as he ran away waving his arms around. She laughed at him and then thought should I play with him then my other friend will be mad. But the class was being mean to! The little boy particularly waiting for her mind to be made up hopped about like a bunny trying to make her laugh again. îI don't have to play with you said ,îbut I am your best friend.îthe class said getting a fare that only her mom would forgive.îThose eyes donít work on me! She said ìfine! îthe class said again and the lit he girl ran offîI can play with you knowîthe class said lets play tag?îthe class said laughing then three said.Thanks for playing with me,îthe little boy said, content that he had found someone to play with after all.
125	17973	7	3	Last Saturday I went to Cedar Point. And we drove for hours! O my go she butt hort! We got there and there were no packing spots, so we went to the back back lot! but then I was excited we were walking towards the park I was the wicked twister and surprised my friend asked me to pick the first ride I said the wicked twister so we got in and I looked at the line for the wicked twister and guess what it took 45 minutes to get on the ride I was so patient that day and then we cut the corner and there was like 200 more people! So that day I rode almost all the rides in the park and ate a whole 2 pound burgers fries and a shake! So theres my story about my patience!
126	17974	7	3	"Crash. Boom! Oh no there's an accident. @CAPS1 @CAPS1 traffic stops. ""We can't stop, not now,"" yells my younger sister. ""I'm gonna be late for dance class."" ""Oh @PERSON1 just be patient, this traffic will be moving before you know it,"" I said. As minutes passed @PERSON1 has to go to the bathroom. My mom tells her she has to wait, but she replies, ""I don't want to wait."" I sat and look out the window silently because that's all I really could do. @PERSON1 screams, ""I have to go to the bathroom!"" ""@PERSON1, I said please just be patient."" I gave her a candy that just only shut her up for a couple of minutes. @NUM1 minutes passed and sister is fast asleep .I asked mom when does she think the traffic is going to blow over. She told me she have no idea. @NUM2 minutes later the traffic starts to move but stops then starts to move again. Finally we arrived to our exit and my sister makes it to the dance class. She got out of the car, dashed into the studio. That was a time I was patient, and it was definitely tested."
127	17975	7	3	About three years ago, my family and I spent a weekend at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 sun dusky, @LOCATION1. It was a perfect weekend except driving four hours in car with older & younger siblings in the car. It was lould, there was crying, there was all of that annoying junk, but I was patient. When my family & I arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 it was crowded! Like jam pack crowded. My mom took little sister & brother on the kiddy rides & my dad took my brother and I. My group went on all of the big scary rides. I went on about every single scary ride that day except for the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!!! This ride was the biggest one of all time. I was dying to go on it. My group got in line & relize their line was about half a mile long & there park was going to clothes soon. Twenty minutes laterÖ I was being so patient in this line. We were in the quarter of a mile range in the line. My dad decided it wasnít worth it. So my group met up with the rest of my family & we sadly left @ORGANIZATION1. It was one of the most sadest ride move ever. So maybe next time I should be more patient. And perhaps a little bit of strategic planning could help ensure I actually get to experience that ride next time around.
128	17976	7	3	Have you ever waited for something or someone without complaining? If so, you are being patient. Patience isn’t just waiting a long time, it’s being respectful and not complaining about waiting. In order to be patient, you have to be respectful and quiet unless they ask you something. It takes hard work to be patient, requiring self-control and understanding. If you're at school and need to go to the bathroom, wait till the teachers are done talking to someone, or if he/she is on powerschool. Do not interrupt teachers during a meeting or when they're talking. People will like you a little more if you're patient, showing that you value their time and effort. So remember, when you're waiting for someone or something, remember the word patience, and understand that practicing it makes you a better person.
129	17977	7	3	When I was in third grade I hoped one of my friends who had some disabilities but I had to learn to be patient with him. When it comes to dedating with someone like him patience plays a great part in friend ship with him, especially when we were trying to understand each other. Even though he had his days I would say to my self ''you have him and have patience '' and to this day him and I are still friends, proving that understanding and acceptance can build lasting bonds.
130	17978	7	3	I will tell you about when I was patient. For a long time, I hoped you would read. I was going to @LOCATION1 to go to Disney World. It took forever! It took three days of driving. We played games like I Spy or Game Boy. We very rarely took breaks for peeing or eating. I really didn’t like the trip. But when we finally got there, it was worth it. We had some fun, making the long wait worthwhile in the end.
131	17979	7	3	"One day I was at home and I was getting ready to go and to eat, and there was a very long line, so I was on the phone with @LOCATION1 and @PERSON1. We were talking about the @CAPS1 test, so then I said, ""@CAPS2, why is this taking forever?"" They told me to be patient and wait until it's time to order, so I asked what ""patient"" means. They said it means to understand and be tolerant and do not complain, so I said I might try that. Then, before I knew it, I was sitting at a table eating and on the phone at Red Lobster. So now I know whenever I go somewhere with long lines, all I have to do is be a lot more patient and don't complain, and the wait will feel much shorter."
132	17980	7	3	This is a story about when I was patient. My family was planning a camping trip to go up @LOCATION1, the mountains. There was a huge camp ground were you can reserve an area and camp there.The bad part was that it was about @NUM1, six hours away. So i packed a magazine, some paper my @CAPS1, crayons and decided the best of it. Me and my sister @PERSON1, Jenny, were playing aganist each other in @LOCATION2, rock paper siccors for about an hour but as @CAPS4, the time passed all i thought about was the camp. Later I was looking at a magazine about camping I didnít know it was about camping at first so that made me more exicited. Then i drew pictures for about an half an hour, that was fun.I ended up takeing up a nap for another half hour. When I woke up I just starred at the road wide eyed constantly thinking about camp. Finally @CAPS2, my dad said @CAPS4, we are here kids!î ì@CAPS3, Yay!î @CAPS4, We all cheered @CAPS5, excitedly. @CAPS4, We set up camp, played on the play ground,went swimming,and had a bonfire. All that waiting was worth it. But the ride home seemed alot quicker. That is the story of a time I was patient, showing that sometimes the best experiences require a little bit of waiting.
133	17981	7	3	Hi, I'm writing about the topic of patience. I think patience is very important to the world. Because if no one had patience everyone would be running crazy like banshees and getting mad all the time. It is important to have patience because in life it's not always fair and you have to wait your turn. For example, when I go to get my allergy shots I have to be patient because other people got there first and have to get served first. I also have to be patient at my football games because everyone has to play, and I can't play in one spot the whole game. Lots of people that aren't patient make other people not patient. Another term for not patient is impatient. Everyone needs to have some sort of patience; it makes things run smoother. That is what this world needs, a little more patience, to make things a little easier for everyone.
134	17982	7	3	This is a story about one time I when my mom was patient. One time me and my mom was at the clinic to get my medicin. We where one of the first people there. Then a lot more people started to come. My mom thought we where the first people to get called we weren’t. Two groups where called then two more groups got called. Three more groups got called. Then me and my mom finally got called, and that was story of the time when my mom was patient, showing how she handled the long wait calmly.
135	17983	7	3	Have you ever learned about restraint just one time in your life? I have something to tell you about it. One day I was at home watching TV. All of a sudden, I had to use the bathroom really bad. Unfortunately, my momma and my sisters had to go too. My momma went first, and my sister was going next. My momma didn’t take very long, but my sister was in there a while, and I was getting mad, but I still was waiting patiently. I was holding it in, but I knew eventually it was going to come out eventually, but I was just waiting. I was doing all I could to get in the bathroom. I was banging on the door, trying to just get back and wait in the bathroom and handled my business. In conclusion, this is a time that I was patient.
136	17984	7	3	Patience is a virtue. It’s something that we all need in life. Without it we can’t do anything that requires patience. People would get bored because they have no patience. Now, here’s a time I was patient. After my birthday, I decided to buy an iPod touch. Since no stores were open, I had only one other option: online shopping. I used Amazon to get it. I couldn’t wait to get it! Unfortunately, I had to wait like a week to get it. It was boring waiting for it, but I had other things to occupy my mind. When it finally came, I was so happy! I was glad I waited. From that experience with patience, I learned you can’t get everything right away, and I learned that for people who wait, good things will come to them. Also, I was better at waiting for everything. That’s how I was patient and have been better at being patient ever since then.
137	17985	7	3	"Over the Fourth of July, on the third of July to be exact, me and my family want to see fireworks at a local park. It was a time for me and my brother to visit all my friends, we were so excited ?? ??. It took me more than an hour to get there. I was so patient because I knew if l wasn't my mom would not be in a happy mood. ""Are we there yet?"" my brother moaned. ""Seriously my dude, Michael we just got in the car."" I said. My brother has always been impatient, I of course didn't say a word on the way there and every time he said something the ride felt longer, but eventually, we arrived, ready for the celebration."
138	17986	7	3	Patience is very important in life. I have been patient many times in days. I'm going to tell you about a time that I was patient and it paid off. It was July 25th, exactly two months before my birthday. I went to my mom and asked her if I could get a phone. She said I was too young, and that she didn't get a phone till she was in college. I told her that everyone else had a cell phone but me, this was partly true. She told me she would think about it, and that if I bugged her about it again she wouldn't get me a phone. It was September 20th now, just five more days till my birthday. I thought about what kind of phone I wanted, I thought about what color case I would get for it. I thought about that phone for weeks. Then the day came, it was September 25th, my birthday. I woke up in the morning to the smell of pancakes. After we ate we went to my grandma's house, because it was also Thanksgiving. After dinner we went back to my house for my birthday surprise. I opened my presents from aunts, uncles, grandparents, and then the last box. I opened it, it was my phone! I was so excited, I called all my friends on my new phone. That was the best birthday ever. It is a good thing to be patient, because I was patient I got the phone I wanted. That's why you should always be patient, and wait, because sometimes the things you want most come to you when you least expect it. By; Alex.
139	17987	7	3	One day when I was home alone I felt nobody was with me. I was home alone because my uncle was very sick and my parents went to go visit him. I was very scared and I felt **God** had left me. So I prayed and prayed but I felt or heard nothing back. So I fell asleep and I heard **an** voice, he was talking to me! I was running in a field with grass. I saw a man dressed in white dating walking through mud, and when he came out of the mud there was no sitting or dirt anymore on him. I ran up to him and asked “man who are you?” he replied and said “little child of **God** why do you look so lonely? I am your angel, one I have come to tell you what your father has said,” he talked to me for a long time, and I did not feel scared or lonely anymore, there was one cloud in the sky, he said he had to go but that he was my guardian angle. After that he rose into the cloud. I will never forget him, he is my angle. And that was the time I needed to have patience to hear **God's** voice. This experience taught me the importance of faith and knowing that even when we feel alone, we are always being watched over.
140	17988	7	3	The time when I was patient was when Christmas came around. At first, I just wanted Christmas to get here. But my mom told me I had to just wait and that it would come soon. So I waited and waited because I really wanted a Wii console and the Sims 3. So finally when Christmas came, I got what I wanted and some. Usually, I'm not that patient, but the reason I was is because my mom told me that it would come soon. I learned that when you really want something or really want to do something, the more patient you are, the faster it will come, or at least it will feel that way.
141	17989	7	3	Every day I have this kid sit by me on the bus. He is annoying every day but I listen to him anyway. We usually get along but we debate about things sometimes. He tells outrageous stories about aliens and snipers. He’s not really my friend but he comes to me to talk. I think if I listen and talk to this kid it is a god sent mission because he doesn’t have many friends. Maybe being someone who lends an ear is exactly what he needs.
142	17990	7	3	I believe we should be patient. I think patience is something we all need in the future. You can be patient while at the fair, in the lunch line, and when you're teaching a dog tricks. I'm going to talk about patience at the fair. You should be patient at the fair. When you're in line for rides, you need to be patient, because the line can be long. When you're getting tickets or a bracelet, you need to be patient. That is one way you need to be patient. Now, the lunch line: You need to be patient. We all are going to eat, so we should wait. I have people rush me all the time; they don't have patience. That's another way we should have patience. Now, teaching your dog tricks: First, you need a lot of patience. You can't just expect a dog to know tricks; it is a working progress. You need to be slow and patient, repeating commands. That is why you need to be patient. You need patience at the fair, in the lunch line, and teaching a dog tricks. At the fair, you need to be patient. At school, you need patience with classmates and teachers. At home, you need patience with family. That is why patience is important in all aspects of life.
143	17991	7	3	"Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. ""Food is ready! Come inside"", my mom had called out. ""Time for food lets go inside"" I said to my little brother. ""Please! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!"" he exclaimed. ""Alright, but just one time"" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted ""I did it"" and I looked at him proudly and said ""good job"" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really glad that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it no matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient."
144	17992	7	3	To me when some one is being patient they are in line or waiting for something and they're being very calm. Where they aren't rushed and are very quiet, perhaps even understanding of the delay. This calmness in the face of waiting truly embodies the idea of patience.
145	17993	7	3	"My brother's checkup was today, why did I come? All I did was sit patiently for 45 minutes, there was nothing I could do but wait, I kept my cool. Waiting there in a dark room was hard, I picked up a near car magazine and started flipping through it, surprisingly the interesting thing was an article about a new Tesla coming out. I read that in 10 minutes, then I went to the bathroom, and really soon was back in the wasteland of darkness. I whipped out my phone and texted a couple people. Five minutes passed and no answer, I closed my eyes and layed my head back so I waited and waited. Right when I was about bash my head on a brick wall my brother enters the room and says ""That's it!"". And then I got a text by two people, it would have been better while I was bored out of my mind! It seemed like the whole day was spent waiting, but at least the checkup was finally over."
146	17996	7	3	The time I was patient was when I was snowmobiling with my family. Because my dad and I have to get the snowmobiles warmed up and get them off the trailer and start them, and he has to ride one around and get us a track. I ride behind him on the other sled, and I'm much too eager to get the snow going, and that is not ideal. We go to my aunt's house in @LOCATION1. I’ve been to a lot of places on the sleds, so learning patience was essential for these family trips to go smoothly.
147	17997	7	3	This is the time when I was patient to my friend @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and me live in the same apartment building, so we hang out all the time. One day I had an @CAPS1 to go to the carnival. I noticed she wasn’t liking the @CAPS1 than she said ìshe was scaredî of rollercoasters, but I told her it wont be a big deal, we will not go on big rides. The day of the carnival came, I was excited so was @PERSON1, as we got there she was really scared to go on the rides, so I told her we could go on the smallest ride. After we went on a few, she wasn’t scared as much. Then while we were walking she saw a ride, one of the biggest rides there, she said we should go on that so then I told her if she wanted to, we could go on it, and she was sure. After that ride we kept going on different bigger rides, while we were walking she said thanks for having patience and that I was a good friend, which made me feel good. In summary, that was the time I had patience for a friend, and it strengthened our bond.
148	17998	7	3	There have been times in my life where I had to be patient. My friends and I that day had decided to go to Six Flags Great Adventure. I love roller coasters, but I hate the lines that come with. When we got there we had to wait a half an hour to get in. When we made the decision to go on the Kingda Ka ride first. Next, we had to wait another 45 minutes to get on the ride. Other rides we want on too had a long wait. So throughout the day there was quite a bit of waiting. Even when we got food we had to wait; with all this waiting it took a lot of patience. My friend and I had to be understanding and tolerant of the waiting and long lines. By the end of the day all of us had gotten used to using our patience. That trip to Six Flags Great Adventure taught me to be a more patient person.
149	18000	7	3	The patience, the engines roared, the propellers spun, the plane moved forward, toward the runway. Everyone cheered. Then we heard a loud crack and the plane stopped. We sat there for over an hour. Finally the pilot got on the intercom and told us to get our luggage, exit the plane and go back to the departure gate at @LOCATION2. At that time I was about to lose my patience but I kept it. Why? Well, it all started at @LOCATION2. I never really liked planes. However, when I heard we were going all the way to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION4, I gladly took the plane rather than a long car ride. We boarded the plane at @LOCATION2 through gate @NUM1. The plane took off fast and we were flying. I was a little confused when we landed @NUM2 minutes later in @LOCATION5. I thought we were going to @LOCATION3! It turns out we had a two hour layover in @LOCATION5. I had to sit and be patient for two hours. I was really excited to go to @LOCATION3 and I hate sitting and waiting. Two hours later, we found out that our flight was delayed an hour. We sat and waited until we finally boarded the plane. As we started moving forward the plane's wing tip caught on the side of the building and broke off. The flight attendants helped us unload the plane. I noticed all the grumpy faces of the people who wanted to get on with the flight. I agreed with them but I tried to be patient. After three hours of intense waiting, the plane was fixed and we were off. I knew if I had not been patient I would not have made it on the long journey to @LOCATION3, demonstrating that patience, though difficult, ultimately paid off.
150	18001	7	3	One time I got sent to my room, also I have to sit on my bed and I could not do anything. I asked one time to get out and he added more time. So for about an hour and a half I had to sit in my room. I took a nap for about twenty minutes. I was so bored and then he finally let me out, which made me feel relieved.
151	18002	7	3	"Once, I was 6 old and I was so eager about getting a new bike I didn't have no patience at all, so that day I asked my dad can I get a new bike ""he said not now"" ""I said pleaseee"" he said later then, after that day my dad was getting dressed I said yes!! That's for my bike so. I went to my dad and I told him I'm ready ""he said what"" were are you going I said with you then he said no not now, I got so angry and went and sat down. After an hour has been gone my dad showed up, so I ran so fast and said can we go now he said ali be patient, I said why you said we are going to go, so my dad parked the car and went downstairs and ate lunch. So I started to get angry I went to the couch and sat their and watched TOM AND JERRY while my dad was eating. After he was done he said ali lets go!! I said where, to? buy you a bike I ran so fast and hugged my dad and went and got dressed. After I got my new bike and I was patient."
152	18004	7	3	This is a story when I was patient. I believed in aliens. So I went in a field and sat and waited for them. I was about 8 years old. So I thought to go out there. I am out there waiting and waiting. Then I saw something, my gosh its just a shooting star. I was so excited but it wasn’t one. All of a sudden I saw a deer and it was running right after me. So I shot it. Then I was waiting, I was waiting. I was bored so I made up a song. I am waiting for the aliens yes I am waiting yes I am. When it got dark out I saw something. It was the aliens. The space craft stopped in the field. The aliens walked out and shot all of them. Then took them home and showed them to the whole town. They didn’t believe me then I told them to go to the field and look at the space craft and they all fainted. That's a time I was patient, and ultimately vindicated.
153	18005	7	3	When arriving at Cedar Point, there was one ride I wanted to go on: the VALRAVN. The only problem was that it was a 2 hour wait. Standing there in the blazing hot sun on 90 degree days I was having second thoughts. Looking up and seeing the light and almost difficult shades of green track of the Valravn, I knew it was worth it. After 15 minutes my brother, John, was already bored. So we played Tic-Tac-Toe to pass the time. I won every time. Almost an hour later, we got to the first pop and struck mageen. I got three pops and about 5 candy bars. John got double the amount of me. Two hours later, we got to the elevator that was about to bring us up. At the top, they strapped us into the front row seat! What luck! Crank! Crank! Crank! Went the roller coaster as it slowly trudged up the hill. Then our cart dipped down, and we were screaming, going 75 miles per hour. We went up, down, side to side, upside down for three minutes. When we finally pulled back into the station, John had puked 1 time. Meeting my group back at the car, we began the 8 hour car ride home, and I turned to my brother and said it is another, so our own game of Tic-Tac-Toe began, making the long ride a little more bearable.
154	18006	7	3	When I was ten years old my mom promised me a phone. But then she I had to wait until **my birthday**. That got me mad because **my birthday** wasn't until next month. I couldn't wait because this phone was a touchsreen with a key board. But I tried to be as patient as I could. The next day I kept seeing these commercials of the phone I wanted. It was very hard to be patient but I tried my best. So everyday I had to try to keep my mind on something besides the phone. Also a couple of my other friends had a phone and I really wanted to text them. Before I knew it it was only a week until **my birthday** so I was excited, even though I had to pay for phone bill. I just wished the time would fly, but it didn't. So all I decided to do was wait. After six day past, tomorrow was already **my birthday**! My days of miserable waiting paid off! So I woke up the next day and opened my present and it was a brand new phone! My heart started beating of excitement. I was so happy then I thanked my mom. So being patient will eventually pay off.
155	18008	7	3	"When I was in fourth grade and I was going to a concert and I had to be very patient. I was waiting in a long line to get in. While I was in line I started talking to my friends, we played games like ""I Spy,"" and walked a few steps up every few minutes. I sat there and walked up with my mom and sat down again and it just seemed like the line wasn’t moving at all! Finally, we got up to the front and me and my friends were so excited to show our tickets. Being patient paid off because if I would have bothered my mom too much she might have gotten mad at me. I had a lot of fun after I got into the concert and heard my favorite songs. That was a time that I was patient, and it taught me that sometimes waiting is worth it."
156	18011	7	3	Patience is used when people are not in a hurry to get to where they are going. Like checking out at a store or at work, some people can be rude and not use their patience; at school and work, you should always use your patience. For example, I use my patience at Kinchat school because there are over one hundred 1st graders, and half of them are pushy when it's lunchtime, and the other half gets hurt, and they don't know what to do. Therefore, showing patience in these situations helps maintain order and ensures everyone is taken care of.
157	18012	7	3	A time I was patient is when I took my black belt test. It took two days to take the exam. The black belt exam was on June 1st and June 2nd, from 9 am to about 2 pm. I passed my black belt test! I then had to wait (patiently) until June 10th the black belt ceremony, when I received my official black belt at the Karate level one. That is my greatest accomplishments in my whole life so far it wasnít easy. I started when I was five, and I am now twelve. I had to perform three katas I knew at the time, and about four stances, kicks, punches, blocks, and blacks. Five minutes of sparring, also called kumite (kun ñ3 minutes of practicle self defense. I also needed to make a poster, aparent recemendation, and teacher recamendation, two written report, and a written test. I needed to perform a kata and show self defense application and do a creative weapon skit and practicle self defense skit and send in a progress report and/or most current report and card. Inconlusion I had to ìearnî my black belt ,[my sensei or person were hormed in the making of this incredible martial artist/champion] (Karate life story ) and I am proud of my accomplishment.
158	18013	7	3	One time I went to Cedar Point and I was riding in the car. And we were about one hour away from the Cedar Point park. And I was talking with my sister Jessica and Mom and I fell asleep. And then we were there. I was so excited that I couldn’t wait to go on the VALRAVN. And I was walking in the park with sisters, Mom & Dad into the park and all I could hear was people scream on the rollercoaster and then we were in line for the VALRAVN and I was in the back of the line and I was too impatient and I was like in my mind comíon comíon and I was like feeling like I didn’t want to on it anymore and it was time to ride the VALRAVN and I went on it and I was off the ride in matters of seconds and that was my story of patience.
159	18014	7	3	Patience is a virtue I have always wanted. Sometimes I lose my patience when something takes too long. In @ORGANIZATION1, seriously, there was an event called @CAPS1. It was raising money, and many people wanted to see if @CAPS2 would close down. The rain miraculously did stop, but I had to wait until @TIME1. It was only six for! So, in other words, my family and I had to stand and wait for two hours and thirty minutes. The two hours seemed to take forever. It was an unbelievable torture! My brother kept on annoying us with queued squeaky noises. My brother had to be reprimanded three times before he stopped! Finally, they let us in at @TIME2, and we got pop and hotdogs. We found our seats and began to watch. Man, I'm glad I was patient enough; the show was worth the wait after all.
160	18015	7	3	"One day when I was going to Orlando we drove for one whole day because we went in the wrong direction and my mom got mad. At night we were trying to find a hotel about 1:30am. I was the only one awake because my three brothers, John, Disney, and caman were sleeping in the back of the van. My sister, AMY and me were in the front and I got really angry because a guy took the last room they had, but I was really impatient and luckily we got a room. The next day we went to the Great Wolf Lodge to stay. We were going to the water park/amusement park. There was a new ride ""the scoping tail,"" but we had to wait for one hour to go on that ride and I was really patient but my mom was getting tired and mad because it took so long. Then the next day it rained and rained so we went to the indoor pool at our hotel, but we couldn't go in because there were too many people so we had to wait. I wasn't patient because I wanted to go swimming. After almost a half hour we got to go swimming. Then the next day we had to leave and this time it took almost two days to get us back home. The time we got there was at 11:00pm. I was patient enough to help my parents get all the stuff in our house, then we finally got to go to bed, and I was so happy to finally be home."
161	18016	7	3	ìKids, today you are going to look into our microscopes. I will pick your partners.î I was partnered with @PERSON1. @PERSON1 picked @CAPS2 to be my partner. I think she is really smart. We were assigned to microscope. The teacher told us we had to draw everything we see in our notebooks. @CAPS2 looked into the microscope, and saw blue lines scattered everywhere. ìHey, can I see?î I asked. ìNo, I have to draw it in my notebook.î said @CAPS2. ìHey, hurry up.î I said, not noticing I was being impatient. ìOkay, who can accept @PERSON3 in their group? He needs a partner.î said @PERSON1. @CAPS2 looked up from the microscope and raised her hand. ìWe can!î said @CAPS2. ìReally @CAPS2?î I complained. ì@PERSON2, donít be rude. You know he is new to our class.î said @PERSON1. @PERSON3 walked over, got a chair and sat down right in front of me. He was patiently waiting for @CAPS2 to draw what she saw in her notebook. ì@CAPS2, can you go any slower?î I shouted. ìWell, can you yell any louder?î she shouted back. Finally it was @PERSON3ís turn. He looked at the microscope and started drawing. I tried to peek at @CAPS2ís paper. She noticed, and I quickly glanced back. ì@PERSON2, you really need to wait your turn and be patient. We will all get a chance to look through it.î @CAPS2 said to me. ìYouíre right. Thanks @CAPS2. Iím sorry I was acting like that.î I said. ìitís alright, I act like that too, hey, maybe we should all sit together at lunch.î @CAPS2 suggested. ìThat would be cool.î said @PERSON3, and I agreed, realizing that being patient and inclusive was a much better approach to teamwork and friendship, especially when exploring new things together.
162	18017	7	3	Being patient is sometimes hard but sometimes you donít care. There are many times I was patient. Sometimes I have to wait an hour or @NUM1 minutes. There is a time when I had to wait an hour. The one time when I was patient was at dance. My mom dropped me off at @NUM2. I waited five minutes because I was a little early. After I waited five minutes I had worried that maybe they were in a different class but no they werenít. After waiting thirty minutes I was really bored and remembered that dance started at @TIME1. I could of called home but I didnít have my phone. Then when five more minutes went by I went in the playset. Me and myself swinging alone. When it was @TIME1 my mom came to pick me up from dance but I told her, ìit starts at @TIME1. So I have to leaveî. She kept asking me why I didnít call and I kept telling her I didnít have my phone. Then she left and I went to dance for two hours. Being patient that long is humble to me. I can go fifteen minutes but I canít go an hour. That's one of the horrible times I was patient, showing how difficult patience can be when faced with unexpected delays and lack of communication.
163	18018	7	3	I was patient when I had to watch @NUM1 little bad girls at my sister's house. My sister asked if I wanted to spend the @TIME1 there. I did, then her god kids came over. That @TIME1 sister remembered she had to go somewhere. So that morning she left me with the kids for @NUM2 hours. So I had to wait patiently for her to come back and finally, she did return.
164	18019	7	3	"One day I had to wait about 3 hours which seemed like a year, but I didn't complain. I sat in the doctor's office waiting to get called, I sat there and waited with my mom. I sat and read a magazine while my mom texted her friend. About three people got called in forty-five minutes. But I sat and looked at the magazine. They called a kid whose name was Tom, and I thought it was me because my name's Tim. I finished my magazine and went on to the next one. I thought I would like it because it had war on the front of the cover, but it's just a cover nothing cool inside except a floating tarantula trick. About one hour passed and only five people were called. I finally finished all the magazines and I was bored. I watched people get called and called finally there were only my mom and I and another group, and of course they got called before us. It was about three hours till we were called, and when we did we had to wait even longer because they had technical difficulties with their machines. When we did get in we had to wait a half an hour for the doctor. But we got in, he made my knee twitch and then made me hop on one foot, why I don't know. But he did the regular put the thing that goes in my ear and the thermometer that goes on my tongue. But we finally got out and went home. My mom asked me how could I be that patient, and I said, ""I have not a clue,"" still wondering how I managed to stay so calm."
165	18020	7	3	When I was going to the doctor, I had to be patient. I went there because my auntie's driveway had a crack, and I was riding my scooter. I wasn't paying attention because my scooter hit the crack, so I sprained my knee. So my dad came out of the house to pick me up. I had to get in a wheelchair and wait because there weren't any more curtains left in the waiting area for privacy. I waited for about an hour, then I got my turn, and they checked my knee. Then they gave me crutches to walk with. It was pretty hard to go up my house stairs, making the recovery process difficult but manageable with the crutches.
166	18021	7	3	I was patient when I was on my way to @LOCATION1 to see my @CAPS1. I was patient because I didnít want to get really excited about @CAPS2. When I get excited about things we have a change in plans, and we would have to ëcancel. So I stayed calmî and we was in the car in a little over an hear then my brother forgot something and we had to go back and got @CAPS2 and I was patience about @CAPS2, because I really wanted to get to @LOCATION1. We was quiet the whole way there I had is the story when I was very patient about going to @LOCATION1.
167	18022	7	3	Has your parents or you ever sent an application for a job? Well my uncle did and was very patient about it. He wanted that job more than a kid wanted ice cream. One day my uncle typed up an application for the job he wanted. When he was done he copied and paste it for an email. When he pressed send he hurried and grabbed his phone hoping for the job. He looked at his phone right when he got up making sure there were no missed calls or messages. He knew he had to be patient. He was still waiting for the call, still nothing. It was one week and he was thinking about calling the place, he didn’t. Then he got a phone call that afternoon so he quickly ran like a cheetah to get his phone. It was just my mom asking if he got the job, all he said was no with a sigh. I felt bad for the poor guy for not knowing yet until one day. The next morning he got a call and he picked it up screaming, “Who do you want!” not knowing it was the boss for the job. So he apologized and also got the job. He was so happy knowing he waited forever sort of patiently and got the job he wanted. When he went to work at his new job he really loved how he got it and now knew you always knew to be patient and everything will work out great. So now knowing always be patient no matter what the deal is. My uncle may not be an expert, he should be now. Again remember to always be patient and good things will come your way, because patience truly is a virtue that often leads to success.
168	18023	7	3	"Supper beast patience. I was coming here from school one day on the school bus, so what felt like forever. I finally got home. I ran inside. I saw my high school brother with a box of popcorn. I asked, ""Where did you get the money for that? I needed money."" You wouldn't guess what he said. ""I took it out of your wallet."" I yelled, ""What? I have been holding that in there so I could go to the movies."" As I thought, my mom said he was with friends. So I ran at him and punched him right in the nose. It started bleeding. I tried to run; he grabbed my shirt. He could have really hurt me each time, but he said, ""I'll pay you back,"" when he let me go. I thought, now he is so patient with me; he could have killed me, and he didn't. Next week he gave me my money back, and he hasn't hit me since. It showed that even in anger, he had great restraint."
169	18025	7	3	When are they gonna be here! When are they gonna be here! I was in CHICAGO visiting my family and my cousins were gooing to be coming in from DALLAS. I was so exited and very impatient I couldn't wait until they pulled up in their black car and I could give them a hug that would knock the daylights out of them. It was around lunch time and i was watching out the window while eating cold pizza. I kept on counting down from ten say they are gonning to be here in FIVE minutes but they were never their. Soon i realized it was about THREE p.m and knew i wouldn't see them untill tomorrow and i will be patient so i don't waste the whole entire day thinking about it. After a good nights rest i got up are breakfast, and then watched some TOM AND JERRY. MOM! MOM! Honk!Honk! could it really be no it couldn't it was uncle FRED and his big motorcycle. A few hours later i heard MOM again and said uncle FRED is probably leaving but then i herd my cousins SISTER and BOB flew up out of the chair and totally gave them a hug that knocked the daylights out of them. I guess patience really is the key.
170	18026	7	3	A time that someone has been patient with me is when I was younger and my sister taught me how to braid. It took a long time, and my small hands didn’t always correct things. But my sister always helped me when she had time, patiently untangling the knots I made. I thought I would never do it right. And that's when she told me these words: “practice makes perfect.” She let me choose from her best string selection, a vibrant array of colors. And she slowly went over how to do it, step by step. And before I knew it, I was braiding just as well as her. I am so happy that she encouraged me to keep trying and that she was patient with me the whole time, guiding me through each difficult part. And that is an example of one time someone was patient with me, showing me the value of perseverance.
171	18028	7	3	@WORTH_IT. One time my family and I were going to @DISNEY world. The morning I woke up I was so excited because I really wanted to get the air port and go to @DISNEY world. @FORTUNATELY we packed to car we drove to the airport. In the car my brother and I were talking about how excited we were. Once we got to the airport we got supper excited! When we got to the area were you wait for your plane the workers told every one waiting for the same plane as us that the plane to @ORLANDO was gonna be around one hour late. My whole family and I really wanted to get to @DISNEY world as soon as we could, but we would just have to wait, we walked around the air port and, and got something to eat. Then @FORTUNATELY that we only had to wait twenty more minutes! My family and I just set down and talked and before we knew it we were getting on the plane. Being patient can really help the soutition. Being patient definitely paid off in the end.
172	18029	7	3	On August 12th it was my birthday I was just turning eight. I was so happy!!! Well while I was being happy and my big sisters were getting things together for my party my mom was at work. We had everything at the party like juice, pop, food, candy, chips, ice cream, but no cake. My mom was supposed to pick it up when she got off work. Then it was time to open the gifts. After we opened all my gifts, it was time for cake and ice cream. We had the ice cream but no cake, but I didn’t cry and scream like a baby, my sister did but she was still four and I was eight and I had to act as an eight-year-old. My mom called and told us she was running a little late and she would be here after she got my cake. When my mom got home we cut the cake and when I took the first bite I said to myself it was worth the wait! I was happy I waited like a big kid, but I was even more happier I was eight!
173	18030	7	3	I am normally always patient, but the time I had to be the most patient was when I baby sat on @DATE1. I was babysitting with older cousin @PERSON2. We were babysitting twin four-month ñold baby girls for eight hours! Let me tell you babies are a lot of work and you need a lot of patience with them. One time during the day that you needed to be patient with them was when they cried. These babies cries a lot and for a long time so it took a while to calm them down. Like when I sat one twin down and it fell asleep, it would start screaming and I used patience to take time and calm them down with gentle rocking and soothing words. Another event during that day that I used patient was to fell them asleep. The baby I mainly took care of took a while to fall asleep. So I was patient while walking around the house and bouncing her up and down it my arms, humming lullabies to create a peaceful environment. Of course, eventually they both fell asleep. A third time I used patience was feeding them. See they were very small twins, so they took a long time to eat. Also when I fed the baby I took care of, natalic, I had to use patience to not freak out when she spit up all over my shirt. @PERSON2, my cousin also used her patience when ìher baby,î @PERSON3, spit up on her too. That day took a lot of patience, but it was still very fun; and you can see that @LOCATION2 and @PERSON1 were lots of work, but patience definitely got me and @LOCATION1 through it, and it was a valuable lesson in remaining calm under pressure.
174	18031	7	3	Patience is a very long task @CAPS2, but the rewards outweigh the time you waited for the thing you were waiting for. From waiting for a computer to start up to waiting in line for a roller coaster, your patience will be rewarded with the desired outcome. However, many people are not very patient (@CAPS1 me); @CAPS2 they can learn over time to be as patient as monks through practice and conscious effort. In short, be @CAPS1 a trial, and with lots of patience, you will find the eventual reward more satisfying.
175	18032	7	3	One time when I was little we were going to the dentist in Ann Arbor and there was a lot of traffic, and me, my sister, and my brother were in the car (we ended up waiting for two hours). I was really unhappy, so my mom told me to be patient. I didn't know what it meant at the time, but now I know. It means to wait and be calm. When I got to the dentist and sat down, I found out I was late, so we had to go back home and do it again tomorrow; it was a frustrating experience.
176	18033	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to Cedar Point. We drove from Columbus to Sandusky and it was a long ride. When we got there, it was a long line to get in. My mom said, “All right guys, time to be patient.” Once we got in, we went to the first ride we saw. It also had a long line. Mom said, “We are going to have to be patient all day if we want to ride all the rides.” Therefore, patience was essential to enjoying our trip.
177	18034	7	3	Have you ever had to be patient? I had to be patient when my older brother broke his finger. This happened at his friend's house on a trampoline one hot summer day. When my brother broke his finger it seemed like he was dying. My mom wanted to see his hand and his knuckles and all that stuff that moms always do. It seemed like it took so long to ask my mom a question if she was in the same room as my brother. My mom called the doctor's office during the third day of the accident and got an appointment for my brother. I thought okay whatever I'll stay at home while he goes to the doctor but there was one person in the way of that and her is mom. She said that I had to go to the doctor with her and my brother even though I didn't want to. After that day I kept selling my mom excuses why I couldn't go but she wasn't buying them. So after a very short car ride that seemed to be a long car ride of torture, we were in the waiting room waiting. In that waiting room we were waiting, waiting, waiting and guess what else if you said waiting then you are right. In the waiting room, seconds got confused with minutes and minutes got confused with hours. Those ''hours'' of torture made the car ride look like a kitty ride. There was no entertainment or anything that could distract those cruel minutes from going so slow. If have ever seen a snail go imagine that six times slower and you'll start to understand how slow the time went by. Finally after all of the time we've been waiting the doctor comes in the room and asks for my brother. The only problem with the doctor is that she is even more boring. The doctor sat and talked forever using word so long it made the ALPHABET look small. I was so tired that I stopped caring. Finally it was time to go and no one was happy except for me. I was so happy to leave the doctor. Let's review. I had to be patient when my brother broke his finger. My brother turned into a dying man and had to go to doctor. The doctor's office was extremely boring. I was patient and finally I got to leave the doctors office. Sometimes being patient has rewards. My reward was being able to leave the doctor's office, showing that patience, even when difficult, can lead to a positive outcome.
178	18035	7	3	One time at the archery range I was getting some arrows but no one was there to ring up my arrows. So instead of ringing the bell a hundred times I just waited there quietly and patiently. I was waiting for about 5 min for some to come and when some one did come they said thank you for being so patient and ringed me up so I could leave. That was a time I was patient, and it felt good to handle the situation calmly.
179	18036	7	3	A time I was pacent was I was wating in line for lunch. I was pacent becouís thair where lotís of other people in line and people where letting other people cut tham so the line was getting longer. I just waited my turn quietly. That is the story of one of the times I was pacent.
180	18037	7	3	"One time I was patient because my dad was going to send me a special present. I was just waiting and waiting for it. While I was waiting I just spent my day I sleep, ate, played games with friends, attended class a lot, and watched TV. After two weeks I finally got it; it was Nintendo games and one hundred dollars. I called my dad and said, ""Thank you."" After that, he played my game all night and saved my hundred dollars until my birthday. That was the time I was patient."
181	18038	7	3	"As I walked down the lane looking for the perfect gift I saw the day before, I find out it was sold out. Today was my mom's birthday and I find the gift, the perfect gift: a precious moment figurine. I asked the manager if he had any in the back; sadly, they didn't. He said, ""The new shipment should be arriving at five."" I didn't think I could wait another three hours. My dad drove me home. I was pacing back and forth, thinking it would occupy me; sadly, it didn't. Finally, I realized I needed to relax and be patient. I know if the time was five, and my dad and I went back to the store in no time, and there was the perfect gift right there in front of me. I picked it up and gave it to the clerk to scan. I handed her the money and headed straight home. When Mom got home, I handed Mom the gift and realized patience comes in handy when it comes to waiting, proving that sometimes the best things are worth the wait."
182	18039	7	3	One day we were driving to the local community center for a very special event to see the president of the United States of America, President Biden, when we got to the park where we going to see him there were cars parked a mile away! When we finally parked the car we started walking; it was a long walk, but when we finally got to the gate I was excited! After we got through security, we thought we would never get there. Me and my parents stood in that line, I think, for about two hours until finally everybody spread out and looked their places, sang the national anthem, the president stepped up to the podium, and gave a long speech. It was the longest line I ever stood in, and I was very patient. It was quite an experience to see the president in person.
183	18040	7	3	One day I was at a baseball game in San Francisco and the line was huge it stretched out for half a mile and we were at the end. So it took us about an hour to get up there so I had to be very very patient or else my dad would’ve gone crazy, so that's my story about patience.
184	18041	7	3	There was only @NUM1 minutes of class left and I had @CAPS1 to do. So I watched the clock tick down ever so slowly. @NUM1 minutes left, @NUM3, @NUM4 at @NUM5, the teacher asked, “what are you doing?” I said, “@CAPS1. I have @CAPS1 to do.” “Why don’t you put your head down?” I was losing my patience and was going to snap, but didn’t. I put my head down, and next thing I know, it’s time to go. I kept my patience and didn’t get in trouble, which felt like a small victory in itself.
185	18042	7	3	Did you know that patience is one of the keys to happiness? For example, I was walking and this guy walked up and started talking to me about his family (just remember I wasn’t very patient at the time). He kept going on and on until I snapped and said “do you know how to shut up?!” Sadly, he said “yes.” He ran home, crying. I went home and when I got home I felt sad for the guy, so I went back to his house and said “sorry!” And for some reason he said “got you!” I said “what?” I was so mad, but I was happy when it was over. But that taught me a lesson though, always be patient because you don't know who's watching, literally, and patience ultimately brings a sense of peace.
186	18043	7	3	I am always patient with my family. My mom and @CAPS1 do a lot for me and I am always patient if they take me somewhere. Sometimes, for hockey my mom and @CAPS1 take me. Hockey. My @CAPS1 usually takes me, but on @DATE1 my mom takes me and I am patient. For homework, I am always patient. If I go to @PERSON1's golfland my mom says she will take me and I'm always patient. So, I try my best to show patience with my family because they are always doing things for me.
187	18044	7	3	Patience. My cousin Romeo is the most patient person I have ever met. @LOCATION1 He is studying to be a doctor, he must go through eight years of college. Eight years of terminology, teaching cells, learning human anatomy, he has to be patient. My cousin goes to @ORGANIZATION1 which is pretty close to where I live and where my aunt lives. Romeo comes home a lot and never complains about homework or school or anything; he has got the highest patient score, trust me. He is the perfect role model. Romeo is on his fifth year of college, which means four down, four to go. He doesn’t have a certain way of taking stress out besides the fact he squeezes his stress ball. It’s not easy being motivated and relaxed, but he does that. Before he left for @ORGANIZATION1 he told me patience is half the process and half the reward, proving Romeo is patient through both word and deed.
188	18045	7	3	"is a story, about patience, in my own way called ""Mia's Day"". ""Mom, hurry up and find my shoes! And I do not want to be late for school again,"" I hollered at my Mom. ""Mia,"" Mom said in a hustled voice, ""you asked me a second ago, it doesn’t take a second to find some lost shoes, you just have to be patient."" ""I know, I know,"" I sighed, ""but I still don’t want to be late."" ""I know, but remember, being patient will get you far."" ""Okay,"" I agreed. So that day at school Mia remembered her mom's words and was very patient all day. She didn’t whine with her friends about the bus being so slow to get to school, she didn’t cut her friends in the lunch line to get her food faster. At gym, she didn’t grab the volleyball when someone had it by their shoe so she wouldn’t be bored; instead, she stood there. During the end of the day Mia's friends started acting like her too. Their teacher noticed how very patient they were when they raised their hand instead of blabbing out the answer. At the end of that class period they all got some candy. The other students noticed and wondered how they could get candy. Then in Mia's next class she could feel everyone's eyes on her but she knew it was for a good reason. Every one learned to raise their hands and not push when they left the classroom. Pretty soon every one started getting candy and the teachers were so happy! When I got home that day I hugged my Mom so hard then I told her what happened at school. I then learned to be patient from then on, and understood the value it brought."
189	18046	7	3	The day I stand for some free BAGS of lays chips. When I was at WORKPLACE they was givein out free BAGS of chip I was number ONE. SECOND time I got to the front MY TWO frends THREE.

I was reel patient I watet four FOUR hour and FIVE min we had chaw we got one chip and left then we got in line at game we was very tire we was going to STORE the was the worst patient I BEEN in. HopeFULLY the next giveaway is more organized.
190	18047	7	3	It was a beautiful morning; the sky was blue, birds were singing, and my sister was going skydiving. Her and her boyfriend, Zone, were planning to go sky diving, so me, my friend, and my parents tagged along to watch. We had a couple of people in front of them, so we had to wait for an hour or so. Then another hour passes. Still not even close to being their turn. We were starting to get hungry, so we went into town and ordered some breakfast; we got our drinks and were about to get our food when we got a call that they were going soon. We had to cancel our meal and hurry back to the place. We got there, still not their turn. I don't really know how, but something happened to where we had to sit and wait in the middle of the field for almost four more hours! Finally their turn, they got in the plane and flew up. They circled the field for a while, and then my sister looked like a little dot fell out of the plane, then another followed. They sailed down to a successful landing. It turns out that we sat there for eight hours before they jumped, not including the hour and a half drive there. I think that I was pretty patient that day, proving my dedication to supporting my sister's adventurous spirit, even if it meant a very long wait.
191	18048	7	3	"Left! Right! High kick left, roundhouse right! The boy's arms are moving so fast you can barely see them. His legs striking the bag with tremendous power! ""Focus, @CAPS1!"" the old man yells, ""That's my boy."" @CAPS2 says softly, ""But you are lacking patience."" The old man named @ORGANIZATION1 then puts a blindfold on the boy named @CAPS3 and lets loose three sandbags, throwing them at him. The first one hits him squarely in the head, but the boy recovers quickly and kicks the second one, busting it open with a satisfying thud. @CAPS2, ever watchful, grabs the third one and uses it to block the fourth one the old man tossed. Through this harsh lesson, the boy learned to be patient and wait for the enemy to strike first, a crucial skill for any warrior."
192	18049	7	3	"One time I was patient when Ms. Johnson's projector would not work. Everybody sat down and was quiet. It took up the whole hour. There was a little chitchat here and there, but mostly everybody was quiet for her while a couple of students helped her. We were going to watch a movie about the themes of FRIENDSHIP, but when she tried to play the movie, it wouldn't come on. You could hear it but couldn't see it, then at the end of the hour you could see it but you couldn't hear it. ""But it worked for all the other classes,"" Ms. Johnson said. The next day she gave us fruit snacks for being so patient, and she got the movie to work. First, it was in just gray and white, then she jiggled a cord, then it showed color, but the day that I was patient was the second time it happened. I was patient with a teacher; she was proud of me, and I was proud of myself. I can't believe what I did for Ms. Johnson. Then it happened again. This time she let everybody just chill in our chairs and talk with our friends, but I just watched her fix her projector, but the next day she didn't give us a treat because our treat was just chilling in our chairs and talking with our friends. That was a time when my classmates and I were patient, and it taught me the value of understanding and support in the classroom environment."
193	18050	7	3	When I was patient, we had to wait in a line for a roller coaster. I was scared. Some kids in line were unpatient and wanted to get on the ride fast. I was patient and waited until we got on. I was very scared when I was on. When I got off, I had a smile on my face. I was glad I was patient.
194	18051	7	3	"Being patient is important. People should always be patient and not rush anything. All you have to do is take your time and wait. People need to understand that if you are not patient then particular things won't happen for you. If you ever wanted something, then you have to be patient. One day at the YMCA, my cousin, Shayna was not being patient because she wanted to get on the dance box. But, she couldn't because a little girl named Keisha, was on the dance box and Shayna was not happy. And you know us girls when we get our attitudes. Shayna got mad and started to cry and roll her eyes at Keisha. Then she came up to me and said, ""She won't let me get on,"" I said, ""Shayna, you have to be patient and wait your turn because she was on it first and that would be rude and unfair to make her get off."" Shayna apologized and they both took turns on the dance box. Ultimately, Shayna was happy and she learned her lesson, understanding that patience is key to getting what you want without being unfair to others."
195	18052	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my mom broke her hip. When my mom broke her hip, she moved slower than my grandpa. You are probably asking yourself how this makes me patient. I had to follow her everywhere she went. If I wasn't patient, I think my mother would be in worse condition than what she was in. I mean it took her almost fifteen minutes to walk to her bedroom. Normally I'm not a patient person at all, but when this happened I had to be patient. I'm glad that I was patient because now I am more patient than I was before. My mom is proud of my behavior, because I actually grew up for a few days to help her out when she needed me. Being patient is a good thing; you look at life differently. Now I can imagine me being patient. I mean I'm not glad my mum got hurt, but I'm glad of my consequence of the problem. After the big accident happened I have learned that everyone needs a little bit of patience, and that is one example about how I thought of a small way I have ever been patient, without my mom.
196	18053	7	3	"I know a girl, she's my friend, and her name is @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is a very good person. She eats all her veggies, does all her home work, and has straight A's. @PERSON1 only has one problem. She is not patient. One day @PERSON1 and I went to the movie theater. We went on a Saturday night so it was quite busy. There was a long line to @CAPS2 the tickets. @PERSON1 looked at me and groaned. I told her, ""@CAPS1 patient @PERSON1, it will only take like ten minutes."" @PERSON1 groaned again and crossed her arms. ""@CAPS2 over it you potato sack,"" I told her. After about two minutes we were only five people behind the ticket counter. @PERSON1 was pacing around like she was in the worst case scenario. She started pulling her hair as I stared blankly at her. She ran to me and said, ""@PERSON2, we gotta @CAPS2 to that counter before I explode!"" I looked at her with my, why don't you just shut-up, eyes. Then she nodded. I stayed patient with @PERSON1 throughout the night making sure she didn't go crazy. I made sure that I kept my cool so I could make sure we didn't @CAPS2 kicked out. You should always @CAPS1 patient or things @MONTH1 turn out bad. Therefore, patience is a virtue that can prevent undesirable outcomes."
197	18054	7	3	"Today I am talking about patience. Patience means to take something easy or to handle something with calmness. Like for example I went to an ATM machine and I wanted to get money, I put the card and the pin, then I wanted 100 dollars, but gave me only the receipt, no cash, no card. I didn't break, I just called the company and I got the money and the card. Now this is the main story. I went to the mall to get a shoe, it was one hundred and ten, was on sale one hundred dollars, I wanted to buy it, the cashier man said ""one hundred and ten dollars please"", I told him ""it was on sale,"" he said ""get out of my store,"" I told him I came to buy a shoe. I returned and went out. That's a time when I was patient. These instances show how remaining calm and composed, even when faced with frustrating situations like ATM errors or uncooperative cashiers, ultimately leads to a more positive outcome, demonstrating the value of patience."
198	18055	7	3	A time I was patient when I went to Disneyland of California with my grandma Carol, grandpa John, and my brother Tom. We were all just walking around, and we saw a guy drawing cartoon pictures of people. I said “grandma Carol, can’t we do that please.” She said “yes.” My brother got to go first. I was just waiting for his to be done. Then his picture was done, we looked at it, and we all laughed. I was next; I sat on the seat; the sun was right on me. I got very hot, and I did not just want to sit there, but I was patient. I didn’t say a word, just sat there and smiled. A picture that took about 15 minutes to draw felt like a half hour. Then I was done. I looked at the picture, laughed, and smiled; I liked it. I was patient, and I got what I wanted. A time I was patient at Disneyland.
199	18056	7	3	"I patience is a privilege I generally don't have, @CAPS1, I made an exception, though. @CAPS3's brother, @PERSON1 ran out to the car running from the pouring rain that described the mood @CAPS6 that day. @CAPS14 opened the car door, and the first thing out of his mouth was,"" @CAPS2, we need to talk."" @CAPS3 @CAPS5 responded."" @CAPS4 about at @NUM1?"" I knew @CAPS5 didn't want to talk about what happened to @PERSON1, @CAPS4 @CAPS14 got an in-school suspension, around me. If @CAPS3's brother hadn't of cared about me hearing, I don't think I would've put up a fight. This was not the time. @PERSON1 divulged into his story causing tension in the air. ""@CAPS6, some guys who I realized aren't really very friends poured water purposely on @CAPS3's sweatshirt, @CAPS12 I went to tell the principle, @CAPS3 at @LOCATION1."" ""@CAPS8. That's what you're supposed to do,"" @CAPS3 @CAPS15 interrupted. ""@CAPS9. @CAPS12 the person, who did it, @PERSON2, got in trouble and went into timeout. When @CAPS14 came out, @CAPS14 started to follow me, and I felt threatened."" I held @CAPS3's breath, looking straight ahead of me. Tension was what I was breathing, not @CAPS10. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS5 filled in the next part, ""@CAPS12 you started punching him?"" ""@CAPS13, yes."" @CAPS14 admitted miserably. ""@PERSON1, you need to find constructive ways to release your anger. There are going to be a lot of jerks out there. You can't start punching them,""@CAPS15 scolded. ""I know, I know now. I 'm sorry,"" @CAPS3's brother shuttered in his very annoying fashion. I timidly asked @PERSON1, ""would you like a hot dog when @CAPS2 get home?"" ""@CAPS16."" I bit back any rude response to the mean tone @CAPS14 was using. I understood that @CAPS14 had a bad day. @CAPS1, I realized that being patient and understanding with @CAPS3's brother was the best thing I could do, even though it was difficult. I think I gained a little more patience that day, and it was a valuable lesson."
200	18057	7	3	The place I was patient was at my mom's doctor appointment. It was a little healthcare place at @LOCATION1 road and it was small, so I had to wait out in the lobby, which was boring. I first started watching channel @NUM1 news, and it got interesting for a while. Then I went to the front counter and got a blue pen and a blank piece of paper, then began drawing. When I finished drawing, it looked like a car that looked as if it was far away; after that, I began looking for something else to do. I began finding and finding, and then there was a car magazine, and there were cool cars: low riders, exotics, customs, and more. When my mom was done, I was glad I had been patient, and then we finally left to go home.
201	18058	7	3	One time I was patient was when I was standing in a line at the petting zoo. The animal I was waiting in line to see, was a donkey. It was a hot summer day around three in the afternoon; of course a donkey was the crowd's favorite animal. There were only a couple of people observing the other animals. In the donkey line, there were hundreds. I was around the middle of the line. I was getting tired but I had to see this donkey! I was being very patient waiting and waiting and waiting. Finally only a couple of people were in front of me! I could get a slight view of the donkey. A couple of minutes passed and I was petting the donkey: BOY was that patience worth it or what? I thought to myself. I left the petting zoo, happy. I had never been that patient in my life! I gave myself a pat on the back.
202	18060	7	3	One time I was in the doctor's office, and there were a lot of people there. I was just getting there, and my dad was telling me we should go because there were so many people. I said let's be patient and wait, and he did. Person after person, and my dad was patient, so it was two hours till they called our name. We went in, and I got my flu and vaccine shots, and we left. We went home and ate dinner; we had taco salad for dinner.
203	18061	7	3	I’m really not a patient person but one day last year at the end of the school year, my older sister @PERSON2 was having a baby, and I wanted to go because that was my first nephew. So I went and so did my grandma, mom, my other sister my # @CAPS1 and my sister @CAPS2, the one who is having the baby's boyfriend. There were lots of people there, and not all of us could go in at the same time. I was too young to see the baby born, but I didn’t want to. My sister got mad because she couldn’t go in there either, so she left, but I stayed; it was boring. But I stayed. I went in the room to visit. It took @NUM1 hours for the baby to be born. We went at nine; the baby was born around @NUM2. I went home to sleep at @NUM3 and went back there at @NUM2:00. We seen the baby at @NUM5 his name was @CAPS3; he is so cute, and I’m so glad to be his @CAPS4. Right now, he is six months old, and I love when I see him, and when he is older, he will know that I was there the whole time waiting for him to be born. Love, @PERSON1. I will always cherish the memory of waiting for him.
204	18062	7	3	A time where someone I know was impatient was in my science class during a lab project. It was actually to me, a very funny way of impatience. My classmates and I were divided into groups at different areas of the lab. We were doing a project on plant classification identifying the different characteristics. So everyone was trying to quickly finish up their projects by taping their plants on their poster. After fighting for the tape from another group hogging it, our group finally had the tape. So our group was just done, and two people from another group came to get tape. One of them tried to take some pieces, and I guess to the other one he was taking too long. So the one waiting says, “HURRY UP!” as a sign of impatience. It was hilarious! The urgency for sticky tape in plant classification was quite amusing.
205	18064	7	3	When I was patient, I was @NUM1 yrs old when I got an AS. I ordered it online and waited. @NUM2 days went by and still nothing. A week went by, and a UPS truck stopped at our house, dropped off the package, and left. I was so happy that I didn't even notice that it was for my mom. I opened it to find Pampered Chef stuff in it. I was really angry! @NUM3 weeks went by and… nothing. I was upset that I didn't really know if I was gonna get it. But then, a UPS truck came, and I didn't see it, and guess what? In the package was my AS! I didn't even realize it till @DATE1. I was so happy that I got it, that I forgot to order a game with it. And that was the time I was patient, so see ya; it was a memorable lesson in the value of waiting, even if it meant enduring a few unexpected package mishaps along the way.
206	18065	7	3	Being patient means waiting, and one time my brother needed bailing out, patience was key. We were there for six hours just to bail out my brother; we had to go to four different prisons to take my brother out. I was scared, but I knew that if I was patient, everything would come out good. So we were waiting; we had to bail him out before 1 o'clock. We were there since 7 in the morning. My mom was very nervous. I told her many times to calm down; everything was going to be alright. So she and my cousin went in and we asked if we could bail my brother out. They told us they weren’t bailing out at that time, that maybe around 10. So we went to get something to eat. We went again and they told us we had to sign a paper. So we did. Then it was 12 o'clock. They gave us something we had to cash. We went to 3 different stores and they said we couldn’t cash it. So we went to the Chase bank and we cashed it and we took out my brother, and the long wait proved that patience can indeed lead to a positive outcome.
207	18066	7	3	"One day it was a cool new game that came out. It was a kid that had volume 1, 2, 3, and 4, but they said this is the hot volume. The kid asked his mom for 60%. Mom said “what for?” He said “so I can buy this cool new game.” Mom said “Son, your father and I have to pay bills and buy food.” He said “Okay I understand,” in a disappointing voice. Later, when the boy’s hard-working father walked through the door. The boy said “Dad, could I please get $60, so I can buy this game."" The father said “Son, I know how much you want this game, but I’m sorry, I need to help your mother pay bills."" The boy said “Okay I understand.” Later the boy’s grandmother called and said I need someone to cut my lawn for $60”. The boy grinned and said “ I’ll be right over there.” He mowed the lawn with excitement. When he got the $60 he went right to the game store, and when he arrived, the line was 4 blocks long. His grandmother said “Well, you got to have patience.” Finally, as the boy was next in the line. To be continued."
208	18067	7	3	One day we went to the mall, me, Sharae, and Reynal. Me and @PERSON1 wanted to go to @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 but Sharae wanted @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 Pac Sun, so we were patient and let her go to @CAPS9 @CAPS8 that store. Then me & Reynal wanted @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @CAPS3 but Sharae wanted @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @CAPS4 so we were patient and let her go to @CAPS9. Then me & Reynal wanted @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @CAPS11 but Sharae wanted @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1 until finally we saidÖ..ENOUGH! WE are going to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @CAPS11!!! She said ok, ok, ok, but can I just... no. Please, no, please. NO! Alright @CAPS12 we’ll go to @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @CAPS11, I was just gonna ask to go to @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 the bathroom. So, we finally got to go where we wanted after some compromise.
209	18068	7	3	Patience a helpful trait to get you through life. Being patient, waiting calmly or being content. A patient; A person usually waiting to see a doctor. There are many types of patient. Patient, a patient, or patience. Out there? I’m going to talk about two kinds. Probably not the two you would think. I am going to discuss a patient and being patient. Although there is no pun intended, I feel that they both remind me of a story. One cold, dreary morning I had to take a trip. Not a field trip, nor a vacation. A trip to the doctor’s office. Why did I need to? To get my yearly vaccine, that’s why. The morning probably wasn’t really cold. I was just nervous, when we arrived at the doctor’s office ,(which seemed like it was even far away) the office man even called me and my dad up to the front window. He said “I have an appointment for my son.” And the lady at the front window said “the @NUM1 appointment?” “@CAPS1 that’s the one” said my dad .“Your son looks to be scheduled for, tetns vaccined” @CAPS2 then told us to have a seat. I waited patiently, reading my book. After a while I started to feel uncased. I was quite bored, finding myself playing with my fingers in my pockets. My dad likes making funny statements, so he told me “you know what? You’re a patient patient!” I laughed. My laughing was cut out by the doctor opening the door. Before knew it, I was getting a needle in my arm. After that, I was all good. But what I learnt was that being a patient patient, helped me stay calm while getting my vaccine. If I wasn’t so patient , it might’ve hurt. I learned an important lesson that day. Even though I was nervous about getting a shot, using patience helped me get through it with ease. By being a patient patient, the whole experience went smoothly.
210	18070	7	3	This story is about Chicken Hound and the fox and a time he had to be patient. Clung the scourge sends Chicken Hound and his mother, @PERSON1, to be boiled. They were both supposed to be killed and thrown in the ditch. But Chicken Hound had only blacked out. When he awoke, he realized his situation and knew that he would have to wait until dark to get to @CAPS1 wall. He waited, although insects had snowed on him. Finally, when the cover of night came, he rolled in the mud to prevent any further blood loss and began his journey. That is when Chicken Hound had to be patient, understanding that haste could betray him and careful movement was his only safety.
211	18071	7	3	I have used patience many times. I use my patience when waiting @ORGANIZATION1 on the bus, at home, and at school. The first time I used patience was when I was fishing. I was young at the time; I had my tweety @CAPS1 fishing pole in one hand and a bag of salt and vinegar chips in the other. And while I was waiting for a fish, I met my friend Bubbles, a Norwegian goose who was maybe a week old. When I met him, I fed him some of my bait, and I guessed he liked worms, so I gave him all my bait and put down my pole. And as soon as I grabbed my chips, I had a bite! It turned out to be a very small sunfish. But still to this day, I see Bubbles once a year (he lives near my favorite fishing spot). And this year, he had some sidekicks: two ducks I named @CAPS2 and @PERSON1. They are very friendly and love Skittles. @CAPS2 is kind of shy around other ducks, and @PERSON1 is very content just sitting next to me or a bench. And Bubbles loves cheese and cuddling with his duck buddies and with me in the calm @DATE1 grass. And this story is true; that's why patience, in the end, led to unexpected friendship and joy in nature, proving its value beyond just catching fish. The @CAPS3.
212	18072	7	3	My family and I were going to Hawaii for Spring break one year. I was really excited to get there, but we had to take two long flights until we finally arrived. My family and I got up super early to drive to the airport. It was about two hours until we got there. Then we checked our bags, went through security, and went to go and find our plane. Then we found out our plane had gotten delayed. We sat in the airport for a few hours until the plane came. Then, after we got off that plane, we went to go find the next one. That plane was delayed too! So we had to wait a few hours again until the plane came. Then we had to sit through another plane ride until we finally got to Hawaii. This trip took a lot of patience because I was so anxious to get there.
213	18073	7	3	"Patience is about enduring, about holding back frustration even when you feel like exploding. Bill and his mom are on their way to DISNEY WORLD. Bill has been waiting his whole life to go there. Bill's mom gets a call from cousins, Tom, Bob and Sue. His cousins ask if they can go. Bill's mom says sure. Bill is a patient boy, so he just lets it go. Still patient. Once Bill's mom gets his cousins, his mom gets another call from his five friends. They all ask the same question his cousins asked. His mom says yes. They each live in a different place far apart, so it will take twenty minutes to get to each house. Finally there. Bill is so mad but is still patient. When his mom gets another call Bill says who is it now?!? It's his dad calling to say, ""I'm at Disney World with Bill's brother and sister, where are you?"" Bill's mom responded, ""I'm pulling in now."" This story shows how even when pushed to his limit, Bill's inherent patience ultimately prevailed."

215	18075	7	3	@PERSON2 and her twin brother, @PERSON1 waited excitingly in line for a concert. @PERSON1 hated going place with his sister, she was @CAPS6 weird. ‚Äú@CAPS1,‚Äù @CAPS2 whined. ‚Äú@CAPS3, @PERSON1@NUM1 asked take an earbud out of her car. ‚Äú@CAPS4 did I have @CAPS8 come?‚Äù @PERSON2 asked impatiently. ‚Äú@CAPS6 you could learn how @CAPS8 be patient, smart one,‚Äù @PERSON2 said looking @CAPS8 see how many people were in line now. @PERSON2 put her ear bud back in her car and blasted ‚Äò@CAPS7 @CAPS8 The @CAPS9 Of @CAPS10 @CAPS11‚Äô by allstar weekend. Allstar weekend the awesome band they would see in concert. @PERSON2 had always been the patient twin in fact that @CAPS3 everyone called her. @CAPS2 was the complete oppisite of her, the impatient twin. @PERSON2 almost enjoyed waiting it made her more excited for things.When then time finally came @CAPS8 see the concert @PERSON2 was glad she was patient; she was ten time more excited then anyone else there, proving that sometimes patience truly is a virtue.
216	18076	7	3	There was a time when I was patient, and I was waiting for a long time. My cousin, Sarah, was walking around town with me, and we were looking for Silly Bandz. First, we went to the Dollar Tree store, but when we got there, they were closed. So we started walking again, and then we saw my brother and my other cousin, JAKE. They were on bikes, and we were walking, so then JAKE said it's a Five Below store down there, so walk down there. Then JAKE and my brother told us to get on the bike, and they walked. So we went to Walmart and saw how much they cost, and they cost $5, and some of them cost $10. So we went to the Five Below tree, and they were $3, but we didn't get them because Sarah didn't like the ones they had, so we went all over. When we found them, she didn't want them. So we went to my grandma's house, and she asked me where we were all day, and I said we were out looking for some dumb Silly Bandz. And my grandma said don't go where Sarah wants to go. If your mama tells you to come over here, come over here, and I was trying to be patient by not trying to yell at Sarah. In the end, the search for Silly Bandz proved to be quite an adventure, highlighting the challenges of pleasing everyone and the importance of listening to family advice.
217	18077	7	3	"One time my friend was patient! one day it was @DATE1@NUM1, and that day was when report cards came out. My grades were good, I had @NUM2. But my friend @PERSON1, was failing maths, she had an @CAPS1, and she knew if her mom sees it she would get in trouble. @PERSON1 tried to cross it out and put a good grade, but she knew her mom would find out. So she told her mom ""report cards didn't come out yet"". And her mom believed her. So then she tried reprinting it. She called me and tried to get my opinion and ""I told her my honest thought and I said @CAPS2,"" but ""if you don't wanna get in trouble then yeah."" And she said okay. When her mom asked her ""did the report cards come out?"". She said ""yeah,"" then her mom found out it's not a real report card. So her mom called the teachers and found out it was a fake grade. Then she got in trouble and she was patient about it and she said the truth about forging the document. Her mom went to the office and got the real grades and my friend @PERSON1 was patient while she told the truth. That's a time where my friend @PERSON1 was patient about her grades, especially facing the consequences. Even though she lied and tried to change her grade, she still was honest and patient about it in the end. I know that it was wrong for me to tell her yeah, but she begged me so she wouldn't get in trouble, highlighting the pressure she felt. Ultimately, @PERSON1's patience came through when she faced the music and told the truth, even after her initial deception."
218	18078	7	3	"Have you ever been patient? I have and I have to say it was rewarding. I was sitting in the waiting room at the @ORGANIZATION1's Hair Salon. I planned to get my hair washed, deep-conditioned, and flat-ironed. The lady at the front desk called me up. ""I'm sorry but @PERSON1 won't be here today. Is there anyone else that you'd like to do your hair?"" A perplexed expression spread across my face. ""Is @CAPS4 here?"" I asked. ""Yes, but she has a client right now. She can take you tomorrow at three o'clock,"" she suggested. ""That's fine,"" I said. My feelings were kind of upset, but that all changed when I walked outside. It was raining. So I guess it was a good thing that I didn't get my hair done. It was a good thing that I was patient. Being patient has its advantages, as sometimes unforeseen circumstances can turn what seems like a setback into a blessing in disguise, demonstrating the value of waiting and adapting."
219	18079	7	3	"A time when I was patient was at Great Wolf Lodge, the largest indoor water park. I was waiting to go on the turbo twin racers. ""Estimated time 1 hour"" our GPS said in a robotic voice but it was only 2 that means I have to be in the car for another two hours almost three, that's not fair I thought to my self but I knew if I wanted to make it to Great Wolf Lodge I had to be patient and wait it out. ""I have to go to the bathroom"" I said in a moaning voice. ""well cant you hold it?"" my mother asked I’m about to explode and your asking me if I can hold it? I thought to myelf. ""ok pull over here, but it's gonna add to to our travel time."" ""I don't care!"" I yelled back to my mom as I was running out of the car door. When I got back in the car I heard our robotic GPS say ""travel time 3 hours."" Shoot man that means no more bathroom breaks I'm gonna have to hold it if I have to go again. A hour or two went by when I heard the GPS say ""arive on destinaton on left"" ""Yes!"" I schreeched out. I rushed out the door to the main entrance to Great Wolf Lodge but then I saw a sign that ""water park closed!"" when suddenly I felt my dads hand hit my shoulder and he said ""sorry sport maybe it will be open tommorow."" Turns out it wasn't open the next day it was still closed because they were working on to many rides that it was dangerous to go into the park, so I had to be patient for that whole day, but I couldn't we were leaving tommrow! Yhe next day it was closed again til five but we were expected to check out at 11:00. So at 11:00 the park was still closed and we were checked out ""I guess we can stay for the rest of the day. ll go send one more night"" my dad said. ""Yes."" I get to go in the park! And that was the time I was patient, and ultimately rewarded for my patience."
220	18080	7	3	I think patience means when you're calm and you don't care what somebody is doing. An example of patience is when your mom is shopping for a long time and you want to go to the video game store, and you stay there; that's a good skill of patience. A bad sign of patience is when you throw a fit in the store. A good sign of patience is when you're at an amusement park and there's a long line, and you don't complain; that's a very good sign of patience. A bad sign of patience in that situation is that you complain the whole time. A good sign of patience is when you are waiting for your big sister to get out of the bathroom, and you just wait until she gets out. A bad sign of patience is when you break down the door and you have to pay for it. That's a good sign of patience when you are locked out and go to your friend's house; demonstrating patience involves managing your emotions and actions appropriately while waiting.
221	18081	7	3	I was patient when I saw a huge bass jump out from the lake at my cottage. I waited and ate breakfast and then went fishing. My little brother wanted to go fishing too. So I was patient enough to wait for him to get new bait, tie it, and come out. So we get out front and he catches a small bass, so I unhooked it and brought him over to show Mum and Dad what he had caught, but little did I realize that a huge 8 pound bass was roaming around out there. So as soon as I got out there, first cast, BAM! A huge bass took my bait. At first, I thought I caught a carp, but when I saw that 8 pound bass jump with my bait in its mouth, I was shaking with excitement! When I showed that fish to my dad, he about fainted, and the same with me, my mom, and my little brother Cody. And right now, that fish is at the taxidermy, a testament to a lucky and exciting day.
222	18082	7	3	"One day on my way to school I went to pick up my friend. He told me that he had this new game called Call of Duty: World at War; he just kept on talking about it and what he does online, like the different game modes and weapons. Then, during the last class of the day, he sat by me and said, ""I can't wait to go home and play my new game!"" I said, ""Cool."" Then he started complaining about having to wait one more hour. I told him just to be patient and wait. Then he said, ""You're right; it's not like it's going anywhere. I can play it anytime."" Then he told me, ""Wanna come over and play?"" After school, we both went to his house and played the game. I told him, ""Remember to always be patient until the time is here,"" highlighting the importance of delaying gratification."
223	18083	7	3	The one time I was patient was when I was waiting for the new game Killzone 2. I had to come up with 60 bucks. 5 lt for the game and 5 to put it on hold for me. I got it the minute the store had it in the shelves. The manager was poking them out so I grabbed one and bought it. I went home, plugged in my PS3, and started playing online. I now have 1,190 hours played. Merged all together, the game is really hard day one, or there were store managers there, one in the back. I do not suggest the game for all are under 16; the difficulty might be too frustrating for younger players, ultimately hindering their enjoyment.
224	18084	7	3	One day my family and me where going to @PERSON1's place to see Jimmy, because he was out on a job in @LOCATION2 fixing a belt line. After me and my brother got home from school we left to go to @LOCATION2; as we where travelling we seen a lot of things like the city of @LOCATION4 and all the buildings there. Then we seen a sign that says “you are now leaving @LOCATION3” and another sign that said you are now entering @LOCATION1, and that’s when it happened – the traffic jam. We where going through @LOCATION5 at @NUM1 a.m. How smart was that? Not very, but the worst part was the waiting. It lasted for hours just sitting there, but we found ways to amuse ourselves, like watch the sea @PERSON2's waves and look at the buildings there. That’s my example of patience, because even though the wait was long and tedious, we found ways to stay calm and find enjoyment in our surroundings, demonstrating a virtue that helped us get through a frustrating situation.
225	18086	7	3	Time when I was patient was at the doctor appointment I was standing there, calm quiet. When the doctor called me, I wasn't nervous. So when the doctor gave me medicine which I didn't have at home. Then, me and my mom went home happy. Got some hwigese and watch TV. Then, we had some spaghetti and went to bed early for school. Then, I had a good day in school in the second grade when I was in land. Then, I went home, do my homework, clean up the house, watch TV, eat dinner, then went to bed has a early start. Overall, it was a pleasant day where patience at the doctor's office led to a positive and productive day.
226	18087	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was on my birthday, about a week before my birthday, me and my dad ordered me an American Girl doll. I was super excited because it was my first doll. The shipping was a problem, though. The week of my birthday, I kept waiting for the UPS truck to come. I was dissapointed, because they shipped it from California and it doesnít take that long to get there. Another week passed and still not here. I had to be extra patient. I could track it online, but I still wasnít happy. The reason why it took so long to get here was because when it was already here, they kept it in the post office. Then finally my mom got ahed to ask when theyíre going to send it and the lady said, ìitís on the way.î A couple minutes later, the doorbell rang. I screamed when I opened her up; she was beautiful. It was worth the wait, as my patience was rewarded with the doll I had so eagerly anticipated.
227	18088	7	3	Patience, what can I say? I don't have any personally; I like things to go quickly. I also don't like it when people do things slowly, which can be frustrating when efficiency is key, and delays can feel unproductive. Therefore, I tend to value speed and directness.
228	18089	7	3	"Patience is not a natural thing; it's something you have to learn. Taking a three-hour car ride is a perfect example of patience, exactly like what I experienced. As we packed our suitcases for @CAPS1 New York City, I @CAPS2 couldn't contain myself. I was already packed up, but Mom and Dad were still standing. ""@CAPS3 Can't you please finish packing? See, I really want to go!"", I exclaimed. ""You'll just have to wait a minute,"" Dad said. But I @CAPS2 couldn't wait, so I grabbed their suitcases, threw them in the trunk of our car, and walked to our kitchen to finish reading a book while they packed. After they finished packing, Dad was carrying the last of the bags @CAPS4 from their bedroom when he noticed me, sitting patiently with a book. He thanked me, saying, ""@CAPS5 Thanks for being so patient, and just for that, Mom and I have a surprise for you."" He set down the suitcases and briskly walked over to a white plastic bag. He suddenly pulled out a rectangular box; it was the newest gaming @CAPS6 console! @CAPS7 I was so happy! ""Thank you so much, man!"" I replied. This just goes to show that patience really pays off, only if you don't complain, of course. Therefore, learning to be patient can lead to unexpected rewards, making the wait worthwhile."
229	18090	7	3	"The time I was patient was when I was @NUM1 years old. When I was @NUM1 years old, my mom said I had to go to the dentist @DATE2. It was @DATE1, so @DATE2 it was @DATE1, so @DATE2 my mom waked me up, then I said, ""Yes, I’m going to sleep."" She said, ""Wake up, it's time for you to go to the dentist."" I popped up and started screaming. She was like, ""Be quiet because other people in this house are trying to go to sleep."" I said, ""Ok mom."" She was like, ""Go grab you some clothes."" I said, ""Ok,"" so when we had both put on some clothes, I was just saying stuff. I was like, ""I’m going to the dentist to get some stickers!"" I just kept saying that, so when she pulled up in she parking bf I stopped in and said, ""We here!"" then she parked the car I opened the door in then she parked the car. I opened the door in then my mom signed us in, then we sat down. It was a lot of people there, so when we sat down @NUM3 mins later they called us. I was about to yell, but then they came, so the dentist lady took me to the room and told me to lift my head up for she can put the thing on the. So the move doctor came in, he was like, ""We are about to clean your teeth."" I was crying cause I thought it was gonna hurt, so I was crying talking about ""its gonna hurt,"" so they put the thing on my teeth they said ""set it don’t hurt,"" then they was done @NUM4 mins later, so the female lady dentist was like, ""you pick @NUM5 tickers."" I was so happy because I finally got some stickers, so when we left we got in the car and then I went to sleep. That was the day I was patient, because I waited and faced my fears, and it turned out alright."
230	18091	7	3	One day I had to be patient. It all started when I raked some leaves, and I was going to get paid for my work. Well, I was going to get it the day *after*, I wanted it that very second. I had to be patient.
231	18092	7	3	One of my stories of being patient is this one time I was at my uncle's house, and I wanted to play the toy. Well, there were like five other kids too, and I asked him if I could play, and he said I had to be patient. So I sat there and waited, like for an hour or two, at least it felt like it, and I didn't say a word about it the whole time; then I finally got to play with it, which taught me how important patience could be. That's my story about being patient.
232	18093	7	3	I was @PERSON1 when l was about to have an allgen l sat and wait for @NUM1 hours. I had played my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for an hour, then l watched tv l got before so l started to pace my parents had to stop me from leaving @NUM2 times l almost left the floor the sixth time. Then l came time for me to go down to the angeo room. It was a fight cause l wanted to walk and they said no, but they won. Then after the angeo l had to lay flat for @NUM2 hours. Then I finally got to go home, which was a relief after such a long day.
233	18094	7	3	@NUM1 years ago our immigration limit had ran out. We needed green cards to become @CAPS1 @CAPS2 citizens. So we went to an immigration center in Detroit. We walked up to the front desk and told the lady we were here. She told us to go sit in the waiting area. There were about @NUM2 people there! I knew we were going to be here a while from that point forward. We went to the waiting area. I had no way of amusing myself. It strictly said in the front, no gaming devices, no musical devices. All phones must be switched off. It was torture. After about an hour and a half they called our name. I was so pleased. After we got our fingerprints and everything completed and we walked out to the car, my mom said she was very pleased with the way I behaved in that office.
234	18095	7	3	I remember a time when I was patient. I use to be able to wait for anything. One time I was so patient I asked my mom for a game and she said, tomorrow and she got the game the day I asked her. At one time I thought I was the most patient person In my whole family. I am so patient I can wait a month just before I go to Cedar Point. You have to be born with patient. Some of my friends are patient but they can't wait as long as I can. Some of them even ask me to teach them how to be patient. I say the same thing to them what I say to everybody who asked me about being patient: You have to be born with patient. It's not something you learn over the years. I could wait three weeks without getting paid from my dad. As some people get older there grow lesser. That doesn't work on everybody. But sometime soon I know my patient will be like everyone else when I get older, perhaps fading slightly. Who knows, maybe somebody might be more patient than me in the world, though I find that hard to imagine right now.
235	18096	7	3	I have used patience a lot of times but I think the most patience Iíve had was hunting. You just have to sit there not talk and stay still. I was hunting out behind my house with my uncle @PERSON1 and we got out there at six-o-clock am and waited there until nine oíclock at night. The deer finally started to come in and one deer got close enough for me to shoot. I drew my bow and shot at it, but it was so dark I could hardly see and I missed it. My uncle didnít even see it until the last second, and when I pulled the trigger of the release I knew straight away that it was going to miss. All you could hear was the deer running away and the arrow crashing through all the leaves. So later that night we went home really hungry, our long wait ultimately unrewarded.
236	18097	7	3	"A time when I was patient was when I ordered a GUITAR in the mail. It was a cool AUGUST afternoon, and I was ordering a GUITAR online. When I got to the shipping, I paid it, and went to the check-out screen. I saw the time of how long it would take to get to my house. It said THREE weeks. ""THREE weeks?!"" I exclaimed. ""That's a long time."" But it was decided. I had to make through THREE weeks. I was ready. So I waited. And waited. And waited some more. Until one TUESDAY I saw a GUITAR. The address said ""123 MAIN STREET""! I was so happy! This incident taught me to always be patient, because chances are, you'll get what you're wanting in the end."
237	18098	7	3	That warm tear running down my cheek, the hot wind blowing my blond hair out of my face. The only thing I could think about was why god had to take her so soon. Lets go back a week ago. We had just got the news my grandmother was going up to heven with the angels very soon. As soon as the next day we were on a plane heading to Florida. This was my dads mother; he was calm at the time but we all had to be patient with him because he was the closest with her out of the five children. When we finaly took off we were in turbulence the whole two hour flight. Which ment we couldn’t get up, NO food, NO drinks and also the queezy feeling in your stomach. It was the WORST! Flying experience I’ve ever had. I flew all the time, just this time it was horrible! We had to take three stops till we got to Florida. Then another fifteen minutes till our bags came in. I was so happy to get out of that death trap! When we got to the house, I had my last time with my grandmother. It’s a memory I will never forget. The stuborn little smerk on her face when we walked in was priceless. One thing I will never forget was my nickname from her ìchicken little.î That final memory, even tinged with sadness, is something I will cherish forever.
238	18099	7	3	ì@CAPS1! @CAPS1! @CAPS1!î @PERSON2 said, ìI wanna go first!î @CAPS2 the time in cheerleading this girl named @PERSON2 thought she was the first to do everything. Oh yeah my name is @PERSON3. Iím always a flier along with @PERSON2. Iím always patient and wait my turn because I dont wanna complain or be a poor spot. ì@CAPS3 set! @NUM1, @NUM2 down up @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6î the two bases and backspots yell. They pop @CAPS4 out and up then scream ì@CAPS5!î ì@CAPS6 job.î @CAPS7 says. ì@CAPS8, itís my turn, @PERSON3, you can do this your better then her.î I thought to myself ì@CAPS9 we can do this. ìOne of are bases @PERSON1 said. I get @CAPS3. Hand on shoulders @CAPS3 to get poped up into the air. Are other base @CAPS10 says ì@NUM1, @NUM2 down up! Okay, @NUM3,@NUM4,@NUM5,@NUM6- @CAPS5!î ì@CAPS6 job @CAPS12!î @CAPS13 cheers but loss. ìI was so excited, ìI just did a pop @CAPS5 without messing up my @CAPS5.î I thought with excitement. Being patient might be @CAPS6 after @CAPS2. From that day on Iíve always be patient. It can really help you out so you know what you have to work on or work less on.
239	18100	7	3	"As a large language model, I am designed to be patient. Sometimes I am, but sometimes I'm not going to tell you a story when I was patient when I normally not patient in situations like this. I had to go to school with my mom so she could take a test and drop me at the mall to meet my friends up there. While I was waiting, I was texting and on the internet and my stomach started to rumble; I was hungry. I wanted to text my mom and make her rush so I could get something to eat. As I was texting, I stopped and thought about how hard long she had studied for that test. I didn't want her to get a bad grade, so I just sat there. I texted people, people called me so my mind was off food. After my mom finished her test, she came out the room. I asked her ""How did it go?"" She looked at me, smiled, and said ""I felt confident, but now I'm hungry."" I shouted out ""Me too!"" We got in the car and went to Subway. I had got the footlong meal with cookies, chips, and a drink; it was delicious. My mom dropped me off at the mall, I told my friends what happened. We laughed for some reason and we went to Forever 21, Charlotte Russe, Sephora, H&M and other places as well. After I thought about it, I never want to do that again. I was starving and my butt started to hurt. I sat there for four hours with nothing to do; never again will I do that. At least I had bonding time with my mom, that's one bright side, showing that even in uncomfortable situations, patience can lead to positive outcomes."
240	18102	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at school. I was waiting for my science teacher to call on me to get ready to go. I was sitting down in my seat, trying to stay quiet. She was calling people to stand by the door to get ready to go to their next class, and I just had to wait my turn patiently.
241	18103	7	3	Patient @PERSON2.Hay, when is our food going to be here (said @PERSON1) you have to be patient, said @PERSON2, well I'm so hungry, said @PERSON1. Well you will have to wait okay; @CAPS2 hears your food (yes @PERSON1 shouts patience is always the??? @PERSON2 I'm done eating, let's go said @PERSON1, hold on, how do I finish my food hurry, patience, fine) I'm done. Wow that??? ??? ??? @CAPS3 patience is the ???. You ready yup, off we go, ??? Success lala- wait you posted it and @PERSON1 all right btd and, @CAPS3 hurry, patience, @CAPS3 said @PERSON1, fine I'll just go slower and @PERSON2, @CAPS4 I'll have patience. We're here ???Ö@NUM1 min.??? this is good news that was a good ride ??? I @CAPS3 right I'm glad you have @CAPS3 ??? now and so thanks. Hay @PERSON2 look at that dummy talking down ??? strands us, where @PERSON2 replied the @NUM2 story building @CAPS4 watch out said @PERSON2, patience @PERSON1 said, you don't need patience yes I do just i.k I told splat @CAPS3 if only I wasn't a patient person.
242	18105	7	3	Have you ever had to wait in a @NUM1 hour line? This is what it was like for me and @CAPS1. We were at Cedar Point waiting to ride Top Thrill Dragster. We had just got there, and the first thing we decided to do was ride Top Thrill Dragster, but the line was about a three-hour wait; we went anyway. We had just finished our first hour of waiting, but it felt like three. I knew I had to be patient and relax, but it just felt like forever. After another hour, my stomach started to growl. I checked my watch; it was @NUM2. We had got here at @NUM3. I was starving and tired, but I stayed. Finally, an hour later, it was our turn. When I got off, I knew it had been worth it to be patient. In conclusion, I learned that patience is something you have to have for a lot of things in life.
243	18106	7	3	"Don't you ever wish everyone in the world would be patient, @CAPS4 if you don't I do. Luckily for me one time I was a not so good girl and I did something I was not supposed to do, but since I have such great parents they were trying their best to be patient with me, like all parents they had to give me a lecture about what I did, but they did not let me get out of the hook that easy. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 please come down to the office"" I heard on the announcement, @CAPS6 I was walking down one hallway I was really??? ""what have I done"" I asked myself, I was thinking really hard. Before I knew it I was at the office ""yes"" I said to the person that was there ""Do you know why you're here"" @CAPS3 said ""no"" I replied. ""@CAPS4 I been having some complaints from these girls"" @CAPS3 had told me ""@CAPS4 oh ya"" I said ""@CAPS4 ya what"" @CAPS3 said ""was the only reason why I was being mean was because they were being mean and they were being so suck-up they would tell my friends that the only reason I hanged out with them was because they had money which was not true"" I said ""ok I get where your coming from, let me call them down"" @CAPS3 said."" @CAPS5 and Alesia come down to the office please."" @CAPS6 they came down the hallway I could hear their footsteps. I really did not want to talk to them, and the thought of the confrontation to come made me feel uneasy, to be continued."
244	18107	7	3	One thing I am not very patient with is the MEAP. The reason I am not patient with the MEAP because it is very boring; you can not talk, and it is dull. I hate the MEAP; it is very difficult, you don’t see tennis see or @CAPS1 doing the MEAP. The MEAP expects you to do too much work; the MEAP is one of the reasons I dislike Michigan. The MEAP asks you questions and words you never saw or heard before. In my opinion @CAPS2, if we are going to do MEAP, I would prefer them to ask questions and words that we know. Another thing I don't like about it is that they grade our writing on opinion; they grade off what they think of it. To me, the MEAP is stupid @CAPS2; if I had a choice, I would choose not to do it. Since the MEAP is important, I do it for my grade. These are the reasons why I am very impatient with the MEAP, and I hope that they will consider making changes to it in the future so that it is a better and more relevant test for students.
245	18108	7	3	"When I was little I was patient, I would always sit and wait for direction. My mom always liked it that way. Now since I'm bigger, she thinks I'm impatient. You're what? No, I am patient, I get along. I am not antsy. I'm not the type who, when they say ""when are we going you guys?"", that is I when was learning how to speak. I guess that is how it goes, and at that time I was patient because my mom and dad were having a talk and I was not about to hear it; it was grown-up talk. It seems my behavior as a child, born out of necessity to avoid uncomfortable situations, is now being misinterpreted, highlighting how perceptions of our personality can shift as we grow, despite our core temperament remaining relatively consistent."
246	18109	7	3	My mom is patient because I use her phone a lot to text my girlfriend and to text and call friends. She tells me when I get a text or a call, and also lets me know politely when she needs to use it. This shows she understands my need to communicate with others while still setting boundaries for her own phone usage.
247	18110	7	3	A time when I was patient was @NUM1 for @CAPS1. My mom told my she was getting me a @ORGANIZATION1 for @CAPS1. I was so happy then when @CAPS1 came and I was opening my present's there was no @ORGANIZATION1. So I asked her about it; she said she would get it @DATE1 when taxes came, so I had to be patient and wait for @NUM2 months and a couple of days. I was mad cause I thought she had it. So I just had to go to school and wait and wait until @DATE1 came. It seemed like the day's got longer and longer. I was getting madder and madder; that was the longest @NUM2 months ever. I didn't even know it could feel so long like that; I thought a year went by. After @DATE2 went by, it was finally @DATE1, but I didn't get it till like the end of the month; that just crushed my little heart so badly to wait for something that long that I wanted so bad. When I got it, it was so fun to play with all the games and apps and the conquerors in it; it was amazing. If something was to happen to it, I would be destroyed. A @ORGANIZATION1 is expensive, but once you get it, you have to take care of it. That's why I am keeping it in a special place away from little kids. I don't even let them play with it at all, and if I feel like they might, they can play with my supervision; that's the only time they can play. That thing cost too much money to get lost or broken, especially after all that time I had to wait. My little sister is getting something like it, but it's some kind of educational one. My little brother is getting a ds. I'm happy they are getting something; they can stop asking for my stuff. My mom is getting me some games too for my birthday; I had one, but my little brother or sister lost it; I was so angry how they can't play it at all. That was definitely something to wait and be patient about; that's why they can't play it because I'm scared of it getting lost or broken. If it does, my mom won't get another one, so I've learned the value of patience and responsibility through this whole experience.
248	18112	7	3	The first time I baby sat was with two little girls. A toddler named Lily and a baby named MIA. After their parents left, everything was fine. That is, until MIA started crying like crazy. At first, I thought she was saying, ìMama, Mama!î Then I realized she was saying, ìBlankie, Blankie!î. Her blankie is a blanket and when I handed it to her, she stopped immeadiently! Now I realize how patient I was with her. Iím glad I figured out what she wanted. Hopefully, next time Iíll be just as patient.
249	18114	7	3	When I had to calm a patient one of my most memorable times was when I ordered my first electric guitar. I ordered my guitar from a reputable guitar website that my guitar teacher recommended. I waited and I waited until finally I got my guitar. I took it out of the box and it was chipped. I was extremely angry. We sent the guitar back for a new one. About a week later I got another guitar, or so I thought. I opened it up. It was the same guitar I had sent back. I was even more angry. So again we sent the guitar back, hoping that we would finally get the right one. It was a few weeks later and I got my guitar. I was so happy and this time it was not chipped. I was so happy when my guitar finally arrived and will celebrate on my birthday.
250	18115	7	3	Patience is a special skill for some people and for some it's very hard. When I was a little girl, I never had any patience, and even now I do not have any either, but my friend was always patient for me. Yeah, she would tell me to hurry up or she'll leave, but I would just start laughing and come down right away. She waited for me to pick up a stray cat and take it to the pound; that's what she would always do, too. Patience I will probably never learn till I'm older, but I know I will learn it someday. One time my friend waited for TWO hours just to learn about history. I would have never learned that myself, but then again, she did get GREAT GRADES on her HISTORY homework, so her patience for that was like, really cool, and she told me that patience is a number one priority. This was one time my friend had patience, which goes to show how beneficial it can be, and one day I'll hopefully have the same level of patience too.
251	18116	7	3	It was a bright sunny day and there was a long line outside the airport. People were waiting for their flight to Hawaii. It has been three hours and everyone was getting impatient, but there was a young little boy in the group that didn’t seem to complain, he was very patient. Now it has to be five hours, their flight has been delayed, the sun went down, and there was a riot going on, but still the little young boy was still waiting patiently. It has now been twelve hours, people began to leave, it was midnight, and yet the boy was still waiting there and has not yet moved. Now there was only fifteen people left, it was dusk, and yet the boy waited there patiently. Their flight has arrived and only there was three people there. They went in the plane. The other people that left saw the plane ready to take off and ran toward it. But they were too late and the only people who made it to Hawaii was the two girls and the patient boy, showing that patience can truly pay off.
252	18117	7	3	Patience is difficult to do. Waiting in line for something or waiting for a letter to come in the mail. A time when I had to use patience was when I thought of a great poem. I heard about a book that you could enter your poem and then might put it in the book. So I worked for a couple of days as hard as I could and I only ended up with @NUM1 lines. I couldn’t think of anything else so I entered the poem. It said on their website that the letter will arrive in @NUM2 to @NUM3 business days so I waited for a long time, checking the mail every day. One day @NUM2 months from when I sent the poem in I got an apology letter for it being so long for them to respond, explaining they were overwhelmed with submissions. Anyways I kept reading and it said that I used patience.
253	18118	7	3	This was one day when I had to do something that I didn't want to do, and if I didn't do it, I couldn't go anywhere or go to the movies. When I was at my aunt's house, I had to clean up her house, and I didn't want to do it, so she told me that her house should be clean when she came back home, and I was the only one there. When I went to the amusement park, everybody went on this scary high-in-the-sky ride, and you have to take your shoes off; then we got something to eat, like cotton candy and popcorn. The next day, when everybody woke up, we checked out from the hotel and went home, and ate breakfast. Then, I didn't want to ride my uncle's four-wheeler down the hill, but he had started it up and pushed it, but I had on knee pads, elbow pads, and gloves for safety. When I got to my grandma's house, I didn't know that everybody was helping, but I didn't want to, but my mum made me help so nobody went outside to play football; it was a good game cause I looked out the window the whole game. I didn't have patience cause I wasn't in it. While I was watching the football game out the window, the other children ran out the door, and I was not done with the wall. Ultimately, I finished helping and eventually joined them.
254	18119	7	3	The time that I was patient was today when everyone was taking the @CAPS1.E.A.P. When we all got into the classroom, nobody whatsoever wanted to take the @CAPS1.E.A.P. When our teacher told us that we had to write on five pages and on @DATE1 we had to finish part two of the writing session, nobody wanted to. So when we got the packet that we had to bubble in our answers, we had to fill something out on the front of the packet. Then we had to put our first and last name on it before we could take a break. When the break was over, we needed to get a free reading book, and our teacher had to read the directions to us. We got started, and when everyone was finished, she told like five or more people that they could have a bathroom break. When everyone went, she read the directions to the other part, and when everyone was doing that, some people got done really early, and they got really bored, and they didn't want to read. So then they all started to talk. She would be right back; she had to go to the bathroom. So once someone came in and would watch us, then all of the guys would make paper basketballs and started to shoot them into the tiny basketball hoop, and then she came in and told us to get in our seats and that we would be starting the last writing session and that after this it would be lunch, and it might even go through our lunch, and then everyone was freaking out. That entire day required immense patience, and I managed to get through it while maintaining my composure. So that was the time that I was just patient.
255	18120	7	3	One time when I had to be patient was when I went to my first NASCAR race. I had to be patient because there were a lot of people there and I didn't want to get lost. And I had to wait till the people who were in front got in their seats. Second, we finally got our seats and I had to sit by this scary person; he was weird. So the race was beginning and you could tell because the racers were getting into their cars and doing their final checks. The jets went over us and the National Anthem was going. Then the racers were off to race. Finally the race starts and my favorite racer is in the lead, Dale Earnhardt Jr. The cars were going so fast around like you could feel the bleachers shake. It was a fun experience but you had to stay close, listen, and be patient, which made the whole day memorable.
256	18121	7	3	I am never patient, but when I am it is only once in a while. Sitting down and not doing a thing drives me insane. When I'm doing nothing and it is really quiet, I get really bad headaches. In school, for example, when I'm waiting, I get fidgety; I tap my foot, tap my pencil, and tap my desk—tap everything. I must do something or I go insane. Waiting in a doctor's office, or flying on a plane for a while, can get real boring. When I wait too long, I feel lazy and tired because I'm not moving at all. I get buggy when I'm patient, and waiting for something. It is usually no longer than 30 min (half an hour) before I get real bad. I can't be patient very long or I get buggy. One way I help myself is playing sports and doing things constantly, as this keeps me engaged and prevents the restlessness and discomfort I experience when forced to be still.
257	18123	7	3	Patience is when a being shows the ability to wait and make good decisions. For me, patience is the ability to stay calm. Patience is very important because it allows me to rationally deal with situations so that I do not get into trouble. Maintaining patience in times of stress is difficult. It is difficult because people are giving you grief. Without patience, people make bad decisions; this leads to bad things happening. Patience lets me deal with bad ideas like the one I had earlier. By using patience, I can deal with the problem and then move on because dwelling on bad ideas isn't productive. Therefore, practicing patience allows for better decision-making and helps avoid negative consequences.
258	18124	7	3	It was the night before Christmas eve and I couldn’t hardly wait. In my family on Christmas eve we go to my grandparents house. When we are there we talk, eat, and my favorite open presents. As my mom, dad, and I drove up to my grandparents house I couldn’t open the car door fast enough. I sprinted up to the front door and rang the door bell a hundred times. “Well hello there, sweetheart” my grandpa said. “Grandpa, can we eat fast so I can open my presents?” “yah, sure.” After we were done eating I sprinted down the stairs as fast as I could. I couldn’t wait. As I waited patiently until all of my old relatives opened their presents it was finally my turn. I ripped off the wrapping paper and saw what it was a game. Since it was the first present I had to open it fast but from then on I waited paitently until it was my turn.
259	18126	7	3	I saw someone @CAPS1 patient that got to a restaurant before I did, and then I ordered my food and it came. They still had no food, so I left, and finally, they got their food. Now that's what I call patience.
260	18127	7	3	When I was seven I played on a basketball team named the @CAPS1. We were playing against the @CAPS2 for the championship and I wasnít in the game. My coach told me to stay on the bench this game because I was the hard seen @CAPS3 player on my team. Without me playing my team was down by @NUM1 and my coach didnít put me in yet. I knew if I stayed calm and be patient my time would come and he would let me play. So when it was the @DATE1 with a minute left in the game and we were down by @NUM2 my coach told me to get in the game and win it for us. So I got in and it was @NUM3 seconds left, I got the ball and started making all my shots. But when it was @NUM4 seconds left and we were down by @NUM5 point I got fouled. I had to take a technical shot which is when you are at the foul line and its just you, the ball and the rim. I made my first shot without a problem but my second shot I didnít know what to do so I thought about what I did to play in the game patients, so as I got ready to shoot I got patient with the shot to think it out and when I shot it I made it so once the other team got the ball to inbound it we stole the ball and won the game. If I wasnít patient in this game we wouldnít have won and I wouldnít have gotten the trophy to take home with me.
261	18128	7	3	My mom has very little patience, that’s way it surprised me when she had a whole bunch the day my grandma passed away. I was amazed she was sad but took her time carefully and slowly as if every move she made had to be perfect. It was a terrible day and all any of us wanted to do was cry. My mom knew that my grandma would want her to be happy, that’s why she watched her every move. As soon as I got there she came right up to me and gave me a huge hug and no matter what my little brother and I did she didn’t even mind. She usually fusses over the smallest messes. That was a very surprising day because I had never in my life seen her that sad but yet so patient, showing a strength I didn't know she possessed.
262	18129	7	3	A time that I was patient is when I had my twelfth birthday. All of my friends except one, wanted to keep playing. So we did. We decided to go and walk the dogs, and then have dinner, and then open presents. When we were all done with that, we opened my presents; I was very excited to see them. That is a time that I was patient. I was very proud of myself for doing what my friends wanted to do first. Plus, in the end, I got a lot of exciting stuff, and I realized that waiting and doing what my friends wanted to do first was a great idea. I'm pretty sure that we all had a great time, and being patient made the whole day more enjoyable.
263	18130	7	3	@PERSON1 was swinging with her friend all day when she was swinging so high that the chain came loose and @PERSON1 fell, she was screaming in pain. So they walked in the house. When they got to the house @PERSON1 was screaming and crying; they all got in the car and drove to the doctors. The nurse said that she had to wait an hour to see the doctor. @PERSON1 wasn’t patient until her and her friend were talking. When the doctor was ready to see her, she had forgot all about why she was there; @PERSON1 found out that she broke her arm. Later that day she thanked her mom and then called her friend and thanked her for helping her be patient during the long wait at the doctor's office.
264	18131	7	3	I thought that when I got hurt during football and was on a stretcher, everyone was patient. They understood that I could only go a cartair spare and waited for me in the hallways and carried my stud from room to room. An example of someone showing this patience was @CAPS1 @PERSON2 had to hurry to go to the bathroom but walked with me slowly so I wouldn't be alone. Another example of someone being patient with me is @PERSON1. Lauren was patient with me when I asked her repeatedly to explain what the doctor said, even though she had already told me multiple times. Their understanding helped me feel less anxious during a difficult time.
265	18132	7	3	I was patient. One day my mom and I went to the eye doctor. It was my first time going there. We went to this lady and waited for the doctor to call us. We sat for about 15 minutes and then we heard the doctor calling my name. We went inside the doctor's room and I sat down; he did all these things, like checking my vision. Later he told us that we had to meet one more doctor. We sat down again and we waited. Then we heard my name again, so we went. The worst thing was that I saw a bottle of eye drops on the table and I was really scared. The lady asked me to look up and open my eyes wide. After that, she took the medicine and was going to put it in my eyes. I was so scared that when she put the medicine in my eyes it burned a little. I didn't want her to do the other eye. I wanted to just stand up and run outside, but I couldn't; she did the other eye and told me to now keep my eyes closed until she came back. When she came back, she told me that was it, and we were done there. I thought to myself, that wasn't so bad after all.

267	18134	7	3	Patience can mean a lot of things. It can mean to be understanding or it can mean to be tolerant. Being patient can also mean you don’t complain. Like if you ask someone to get you something and they say that they will get it in a certain amount of days. If they don’t get it the day they said they would and you were expecting it then you shouldn’t get mad. You can also be patient if you have to wait for something. If you are getting a new pair of shoes but the only way you can get them is they have to be ordered. You should not start to complain if it takes a long time. You should be able to wait without getting angry that you don’t have them yet. Being patient also involves remaining calm and composed when faced with delays or setbacks. If a project at work is taking longer than expected, a patient person will continue to work diligently without becoming frustrated. Being patient can mean all of these things. If you do these things you can tell that you are patient. That is what being patient means, and understanding its many facets allows us to better practice it in our daily lives.
268	18135	7	3	Patient, that's all I am when I go fishing. If there is a spot where you cast, it takes sometimes almost fifty casts just to get a bite; then you have to wait for it to swallow it. Sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use because sometimes you have to count in the water color, amount of weeds, and what the fish eat. You must consider the depth and clarity, and then select accordingly. Then you have to have patience on the spot you aren't too because after the motor runs you have to wait for the fish to come back. They scatter from the noise, needing time to regroup. So, you have to have a lot of patience to go fishing, and that virtue is key to any successful fishing trip.
269	18136	7	3	Anna sat there waiting patiently, come on come on come on! She thought to herself, meets, and was very excited to perform her now improved beam routine. Anna was one of the last gymnasts to go, only making her situation more difficult; she took a deep breathe, and sat down patiently, waiting for her chance to shine to the judges. She visualized each step, the leaps, the turns, the dismount, hoping she would stick the landing. The anticipation was building, but she knew that with focus, she could nail it, and show everyone how much she'd improved.
270	18137	7	3	"It was the @DATE1 when I went to see the Creed concert with my cousins. There must have been @NUM1 or @NUM2 people in front of us. Then I heard and saw people shouting and pushing to get in. About @NUM3 to @NUM1 minutes later my legs started aching but I held on. I kept telling myself, ""the pain is worth the wait!"" Finally, we got to the security guards; they had to do a metal detector scan on us. When we walked into the concert, I said, ""that was a wait worth waiting for."""
271	18138	7	3	"A time when I was patient. Two weeks ago @CAPS4 and @CAPS2 said her @CAPS1 was coming. @CAPS4 grandma was happy so she bought her sister a bus ticket. Bus tickets cost a lot of money. It is @NUM1 dollar. That was a lot of money. She couldn't miss this bus because I really want to see her. I could not wait. So she was suppose to be coming on @DATE1. She didn't come. I was sick so I called @CAPS4 and @CAPS2 at her job. I said, ""@CAPS2 why didn't @CAPS3 come?"" @CAPS4 and @CAPS2 said,"" @CAPS5 she is coming you just have to be patient."" ""@CAPS6,"" I said. Next day was @DATE2. ""@CAPS2 is she here yet"" I said. ""@CAPS8, @CAPS5 be patient she will be here tomorrow."" ""@CAPS6, I understand."" I gave up I thought that she was not coming. So @CAPS4 mom called @CAPS4 godmom. She said it was @CAPS6. So she told me she was going to @ORGANIZATION1. I love @ORGANIZATION1. I so good. I asked @CAPS4 and @CAPS2, ""Can I have a @CAPS12?"" @ORGANIZATION2 cheese burger. I said @CAPS13 to @CAPS4 uncle and @CAPS4 mom said she was not coming. I told @CAPS4 mom I was not giving up she was coming. So I said I am hanging up. So I air hustled. @CAPS4 mom said to @CAPS4 uncle @CAPS14 ""should I get her something to eat."" I thought she ment @CAPS4 grandmother. So I thought for a while who is her. So I called back @CAPS4 mom said ohh I get food for uncle @CAPS14 dog. I said, ""@PERSON1's? For a dog?"" She said know dog food. So @CAPS4 mom got me from @CAPS4 god mothers house I could not walk because @CAPS4 legs, back, arm and every part that I couldn't move on @CAPS4 body hurt. So @CAPS4 grandmother came to her house because we have a keys. So she said where is @CAPS16? @CAPS4 uncle whispered something and I said she here! Ran in @CAPS4 uncle room and hug her I said how are you because when I went for @CAPS4 grandmother birthday. She live in south caroline so yeah. The is @CAPS4 writing. That is when I was patient, even though it was difficult, the eventual arrival made the waiting worthwhile."
272	18140	7	3	Two years ago, when the first @CAPS1 phone came out my step dad paid eight hundred dollars for one. He was so happy and would constantly brag to his family and friends about it. During this time my mom had broken her phone, and my step dad did not want to let her use his new phone. So she was phoneless for at least three months. She was kind of mad but it was worth being patient for the newer model. As the newer and improved @CAPS1 phone came out in stores my mom was finally able to buy it. She was so glad because it had more apps then the first @CAPS1 phone and even a webcam. I think that my mom did a good job at being patient because if it was someone else they wouldn’t be able to wait that long, showing her admirable restraint and ultimately rewarding her with a better device.
273	18141	7	3	"When I was about @NUM1 I wanted one thing in the world. You know how some girls would want a baby doll, not me, I wanted a Rex. This toy was the biggest and the meanest dinosaur on the planet, well when I was little it was. It was so cool to me. It could walk, talk, it can run, he can bite. Every time I go to the store I would go to the toy part of the store, and find that Rex and look at it in the eyes and say ""you will be mine one day."" You know how you really want something and mom says Christmas is coming up. When it ain't coming in till @NUM2 months. But I want it now not in @NUM2 months. So I thought what can I do to get the Rex before @NUM2 months? I got it! I will clean up more, walk the dog more, do better in school, and hopefully that will work. So I ask my mom ""mom if I start doing all this good stuff can I get some of my Christmas thing in a week @NUM5?"" she said ""no you just get more thing on Christmas."" I was so mad I was about to cry. But @NUM2 month was not that long. I was opening my gifts in no time. I thought that I open all my gifts, I look around one good time I did! But I don't see the Rex. I was sad even though I had like @NUM7 or more gifts. I still don't have that Rex. So I sadly walk to my room. My mom came in my room with a big box. Could it be! I jumped out of my bed so fast my mom didn't see me. I looked in the box it was a lot of baby dolls. Then she said go down stars and there he was Rex looking so happy to see me, making my Christmas the best one ever."
274	18142	7	3	ì@NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6, @NUM7, @NUM8!î my poms coach @PERSON1 says as we practice the dance over and over again. I love poms but at times it gets very tiring. We have practice @DATE1, and @DATE3. We also have six girls including me. My coach loves to make us do the dance one time by ourselves .On our first game we had practice right before we left for our very first performance. All of us were so excited we all just wanted to go and perform all day. But the game was at @NUM5:45 pm and they didnít even start until @NUM6:00 pm which was way later than expected. So all my poms team, our coach, and all of our family had to wait patiently on the bleachers for over @NUM11 minutes until we actually, finally got to perform. Finally it was the @DATE2 and the clock bit three, which ment we all went on the track to stretch .We were all so happy but still a little sad that we didnít get to perform earlier. We had a minute on the clock so we walked to the other side. Getting in our formation the clock quickley started to drop from fifty seconds to @NUM12 then quickely we only had @NUM13 seconds until we went on. I couldnít believe it, only @NUM13 seconds until our very first performance. The thrill rushed through my head as the man announced ì@CAPS1 performing @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 pom pon teamî then our names over the speakers. The crowed roared as we entered the field. We quickley all reminded our self to smile. Then the music came on and we all danced our hearts out honoring and thanking our coach and our parents. After we finished we were automatically huttled around by friends and family. And waiting and being patient wasnít so bad anymore. It was all worth the wait.
275	18143	7	3	When dealing with toddlers or the elderly you must have patience. This patience is key when dealing with anyone, but very young and very old need more. Elderly often can become confused, have a hard time hearing you, or just be a bit slower than you. You must practice patience and give them respect. Very young children are confused sometimes too because they are just learning. Toddlers will often become upset and refuse to do what you tell them if you have no patience with them and start to yell. Patience is also important for mentally or physically challenged persons. If they are challenged, there is no way that they can help it. Mentally challenged people often don't understand or don't want to do things just like toddlers. Be patient with the physically challenged because some tasks can be hard for them to complete. Be patient with everyone because patience is respect. Fear is not respect. That is how I feel about the word patience. Therefore, showing patience is a fundamental way of demonstrating respect and understanding towards others, regardless of their age or abilities.
276	18144	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was babysitting and the kids I was babysitting were acting up. It was hard for me to get them to calm down, as they were running around and yelling. But, I noticed that if I was patient then they would too. So, I just sat down and told them to calm down, and they wouldn't. So I told them that again, in a calm voice, and this time they were a bit quieter; I noticed that if I ignored them or was patient then they would settle down and stop because they were trying to get my attention. If I was being patient then I knew they would be too. It worked; they settled down and were being a lot better when I was babysitting them the next time too, showing me that patience can truly be effective in managing difficult situations.
277	18146	7	3	ìBack harder on the reighns!î my teacher yelled ìI'm trying, but he's not listening!î He had to be the most stubborn horse I had ever ridden in my life! He did whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted, and payed no attention to me at all. ìOkay, okay bring him in.î He said I slowly walked the horse into the center of the ring. ìMr. Henderson, I really am trying, he's not listening.î I said ìI know he can be a bit hard-headed but I make you ride him because I believe you can handle him.î The horse's name was Gus, he was a reddish-brownish color with big glassy brown eyes. He looked like a great horse that listened to its rider. Wrong! He was not nice or sweet and didnt listen at all! ìOkay walk him around a couple of times along the perimeter.î Mr. Henderson said. ìOkay fine.î I replied. As I was halfway around the ring, Gus stopped. Then he turned to his right, walked up to the window and started licking the water that beaded up on it. ìJessica! What is he doing!î Mr. Henderson yelled ìI think he is licking the water off the windows.î I said ìSomeone get him away from there, he could get sick!î Okay, as I said earlier, the horse has terrible listening skills! Now I was getting in trouble because of him! ìOkay be patient Jessica.î I guess I did need to calm down, so I relaxed a little and continued riding with no problems. I guess I needed patience and to relax. Even if so, I am still never getting on that horse again.
278	18147	7	3	"On my way to @LOCATION1 to visit my dad. While in the car there is food and I brought along my @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 to keep me busy; I brought my @CAPS1 along because it would be annoying if I ask ""are we there yet?"" very @NUM1 minutes, and I knew that a @NUM2 hr drive would need some entertainment. Most of the time I would be playing games so time goes by fast; if I don’t play games then I eat a snack, play with my baby cousin, @PERSON1, and sleep. After awhile of that I sit back and relax. The whole trip is @NUM2 hrs but by doing all that it seems to be more like @NUM4 or @NUM5 hrs, making the journey much more bearable and go by swiftly."
279	18148	7	3	"Patience is basicly waiting and tolerating it. Every year on @MONTH1 @NUM1 my family become seasonal at a camp ground. There @CAPS1 play and have fan and make many life long friends. Every weekend @CAPS1 go out there and @CAPS1 take are speed boat, ""the glass from. ""@CAPS1 pat it into the the lake and dock it at a dock. Then @CAPS1 go fishing on every part of the lake and sit there for six hours. This is were patience comes in @CAPS1 have to sit and watch oar bobbers float on the smooth glass like lake. @CAPS1 sit there and watch and talk and bake in the sunlight. It is quite peaceful thowe that I'm off school and I @CAPS2 to spend time with my parents. Then in school I have to wait threw out the year and patient so the year can be over. So @CAPS1 sit there until the sudden noise of on of our bobbers sinking into the water. After that theres some yelling and ""@CAPS2 the net ""sayings. The funny part is that it is that it is ethier a large bass or a small nor there. And all this takes patience. So, from the quiet moments of waiting for a fish to bite, to enduring the school year for summer to return, patience is woven into our family's tradition and fun."
280	18149	7	3	My dog tedy bear is very impatient because when he comes in from outside he gets a treat, but he has to wait for the other dogs to come in, causing him to whine and pace anxiously.
281	18150	7	3	One @DATE1 @TIME1 I was very patient when I was waiting for my sister in law to tell my brother to tell us we could come in the hospital room and see their brand new baby @CAPS1. My father and mother were waiting with my sister, bother and I, in the waiting room / lobby. At the time it was probably for an hour and a half waiting. I guess that I could say that I was being patient. Also very ten to fifteen minutes I would have to get up and walk around. I was so shaky nervous and jumpy. But it probably didn't help that I drank three cans of pepsi and right before the time I was being patient. So, despite my inner turmoil, I managed to remain outwardly calm, demonstrating patience in a situation filled with anticipation.
282	18151	7	3	Patience to me is a personal thought that turns into action. I've been patient many times before. I used to go to the store at the corner of my block. I had to stand in a long line that actually went to the halfway point of my block. I went in, got my stuff, and went to the end of the line. A half hour passed, and it was five minutes 'til closing time. I got to the window and paid for my things one minute before closing time. I was actually standing in line doing nothing, just waiting. The owner of the store, noticing my wait, let me get a total of two things for free. I got half of the stuff I wanted, and the other half was household things, like cleaning supplies. So, being patient really pays off and can unlock many different treasures; it certainly did that day. So start running with patience and leaving impatience behind; you never know what rewards await.
283	18152	7	3	Well you need patience when you are fishing, waiting for that elusive bite, and when your food is coming or going to be served to you, whether at a restaurant or at home. But it's equally important to be patient with everybody else, showing understanding and tolerance in your interactions, as patience contributes to smoother and more harmonious relationships, overall making life more pleasant.
284	18153	7	3	Just as I finished eating my hamburger I noticed an old, crude excuse for a bus parked outside of the restaurant window. ìWhat's that?î I asked through my squeaky seven-year-old voice. My mom responded, ìThat bus takes people to the palace across the street, where Elvis is playing.î ìWouldn't it be cool if we could go?î I questioned. I saw my mom whisper something to my brother. It was then that they told me we were going to the show. Excitedly, I climbed into the back seat of our car and we drove across the street to the palace of Paramount Theater. It was huge! All I wanted to do was enter the marvelous building, but my mom kept telling me we had to wait. About fifteen minutes later the two pepsis I had drinken earlier made it through my system ìMom, I have to go to the bathroomî, I said over and over again. Finally, my mom took me through the front doors. The inside of the building was even more fabulous than the outside! However, a rail of red rope blocked our way. ìCould my son use the bathrooms?î my mom asked a lady who sat behind the front desk. She gave a cold ìnoî and we were forced to return back to the car. Another fifteen minutes passed. The concert would start soon, so we returned to the building. This time the red rope had gone, but replaced by a line of nearly fifty people who were all waiting to get through the metal detector! It took almost 20 minutes, but we made it to the front of the line, we passed through the metal detector and took our seats. That was a true test of my patience, but it all was worth it when I was finally allowed to use the bathroom, finally finding relief after all that waiting.
285	18154	7	3	I was patient when I went to the local park @LOCATION1 Funland @CAPS1. First it started out when I got a call from my friend Tom @PERSON1 he asked me to go. So I said yes. I had to be patient during the trip to the derms the next day @DATE1. Then he drive it way long but I was patient. When we got to the entrance I felt good for being patient. All that patience paid off in the end.
286	18156	7	3	Once apoon a time there was a place called unpaciente land. But on grumpy lane lived a little girl namend Lily. She was the most patient girl ever. One day Lily went to get her hair cut ìat mtso fast saloon!î When Lily got there everyone was screaming at Bob the hair cutter and Lily stood up and said hey if you want your hair to look good sit down and be quiet and everybody did. Lily went home with a beautiful haircut just like everybody else and then Lily became the mayor of unpaciente land renamed it Patience land from that day forward every body was pacient. Thus, due to Lily's extraordinary patience and leadership, the land transformed into a haven of tranquility.
287	18159	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to the doctor with my step mom & brother. He was getting his knee looked at; we were in that waiting room for like two or three hours! Jody (my step mom) was getting really irritated I told her that the doctor will be out soon. I was very patient, my brother and I were playing with his phone. That kind of made Jody relax because usually I’m not very patient usually everyone tells Jody that I’m really impatient. For some reason when I’m really excited I’m fairly patient. I was exulted to see if he could get his knee brace off. Sure enough he did, he was so happy that two hours was worth it! This experience truly highlighted my capacity for patience.
288	18160	7	3	One time I was patient. It was December 24th, Christmas eve. I was so excited that Christmas was almost here. On Christmas eve morning I slept till 10 AM I wanted Santa to come. I was patient so I played video games not thinking about Christmas. When I went to the store I seen all the Christmas things. I felt like I couldn’t wait no longer. That night after dinner I found that I wanted to stay awake instead of going to sleep early to make Christmas come faster. A little part of me wanted to go to sleep but I also wanted to stay up. I made some more food and went to sleep. When morning came I was so happy I ran into the living room. Sure enough there were the presents. My mom and dad were still sleeping. I decided to watch some TV till noon came and I wanted to open them so badly. I knew it wouldn’t be right so I went to sleep again. At noon I woke up and ran to the living room. My mom and dad and my brother were there, I opened my presents like a lion feasting on a gazelle, I was so happy I waited, and it made the experience even better.
289	18161	7	3	When I was patient I had no fears no argument but I had a good deal. I had a CAR, GAS was so good my sister Mary said “Can I get some?” I said “No you cannot.” GAS was a miracle so I was driving her car at the gas station. I went to Walmart. I said, “5 dollars please.” GAS was a cousin of mine and she said, “2 days ago I was like “wow.” Mary called my phone because GAS was my daddy’s weekend she said, “get down there now.” I was like wow. It’s amazing how simple things like affordable gas and family time can bring about such strong emotions and actions.
290	18162	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was on the drive to @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 took a few hours so here is @CAPS2's story. We were leaving the house when I realized I forgot something. I quickly ran inside to get @CAPS2's dog Penny [she is real not fake]. @CAPS2's dog bitted out the door and I put her in the truck. We stopped at @CAPS2's grandmas and grandpas house and rested. We travelled through lots of roads until we got to the highway. ì@CAPS1's gonna be a long rideî I said. We passed so many cars. Then they passed us. For a second we lost our grandparents car. I looked back and behind about twelve cars I found them. We reached @LOCATION3 in about four hours. I knew @CAPS1 was going to be a long trip so I decided to take a nap. During @CAPS2's nap @CAPS2's parents [@CAPS2's mom] took pictures of me. I thought that @CAPS1 wasn't nice. We now have one more state to go through and then were in @LOCATION1. That state was @LOCATION2. By the time we reached @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 was already @NUM1. We decided to get a room like a hotel. In the morning we stopped and ate breakfast. Then on the road again. I had to be patient because we still had a two hour drive to go. Longest five hours even but I was patient so @CAPS1 was fine. We arrived in @LOCATION1 and had no clue where we were going. So @CAPS2's dad turned on his GPS and we found our way to our cabins. That is a story about a time I had to be patient, and in the end, my patience was rewarded.
291	18163	7	3	Thereís many times Iíve been patient. @CAPS1 this one time, my little sister kept bugging me, and I didnít scream at her or hit her. She was asking me to turn on the music and I said ìnoî, she threw a fit. So I got up and picked her up, and told her to stop before she gets hit, in a nice and kind voice. And she stopped. And I told her to sit down and be quiet and watch tv. In closing, that was a time that I was patient with my little sister, by not screaming at her or hitting her when she was disturbing me. I didnít become a mean person at that point. Last but not least that was a time that I was a patient person, and I am glad I handled the situation calmly.
292	18164	7	3	Patience for me is when I'm helping others with their problems, so in this story I'm going to describe to you what patience is. Patience is when you are willing to sit down and help someone with their own problems. I have a lot of patience because I sit down all the time and help people with their problems. One day at my old school, @PERSON1, this girl was having very difficult problems at home. When she came to school, she was crying. I went to go ask her what was wrong. She was saying that she didn't want to be at home because her mom didn't let her go anywhere; she always had to stay home and watch her two brothers. So I sat down all day with her and let her feel like she had someone to talk to for once in her life. As we sat and talked, she seemed to feel much better, and she felt like she had a true friend. In conclusion, I really felt like I had patience, and since that day forward, I have sat down and let people tell me about their problems, understanding that sometimes just listening is the most patient and helpful thing I can do.
293	18165	7	3	"There was a time I was patient for a whole day! It was Christmas eve and it was about 9:00, meaning I just woke up, I ate breakfast brush my teeth after I got out of the shower. By now I would have probably ask my mom two times if I could open one present, but on this day I hadn't ask her once yet. I was up string playing my play station when my mom called up stairs!!!! I open my door and as usual my cat was right at my door I shut my door hop over my cat get to the stairs then yell food. He scurried down the stairs and right to the canter. As I start walking down the stairs I hear a thump!! So I start running down the stairs as fast as I could knowing my two 3 year old brothers were coming. They meet mom at the counter and ask mom. ""How many times have you ask to open a present?"" ""Zero"" I said. They looked like they had both seen a ghost. After lunch was over I ran over to my friend house across the street to play basketball. About an hour later we finish our game and take a bike ride we got back about 4:00 for dinner about 5 minutes later I was done watch T.V. take a shower then went to bed. My mom woke me up at 7:00 and we heat down stairs and as soon as I saw all the present I scream mom Merry Christmas!!!! And that was the time when I was patient for a whole day."
294	18166	7	3	ìMom @CAPS1 Dad @CAPS2î said my little sister @PERSON1 ìCan @CAPS3 you help me practice kicking a soccer ball? We are doing it in gym and I donít know how.î ìOf corseî I said ìlets go to the back yard.î On @CAPS4 my way out I grab a ball. I set it down @CAPS4 the ground in the front of me and say ìAll @CAPS5 you do is step forward with you left foot and kick with the top of you right. ì Iíll try I @CAPS8 sayî daughtfully. @PERSON1 runs up to the ball an kicks, he misses but thats okay @CAPS7. @PERSON1 trys againe another miss. @PERSON1 sits down @CAPS4 the ground looking dejected. I go up to her. ìDonít @CAPS6ít give up, its only your second try, not everyone is good at soccer, try one more time. ìOkay @CAPS7, one more try.î @PERSON1 runs up to ball and kicks. The ball goes sailing into the goal. ìThank @CAPS9 you for teaching me Dad @CAPS2.î ìIt was my pleasure just try to be patient with yourself and youíll be a great soccer player I promes.î ìOkay @CAPS7 but I want to practice some more.î ìOkay @CAPS7.î And with that, we continued practicing, her initial frustration replaced with determination, showing how patience and encouragement can lead to success.
295	18167	7	3	Patient is when you are understanding and tolerant. Many parts of life are achieved with patience, because some things are worth waiting for @CAPS1 there is always a time and a place for everything, and getting there is achieved with the great virtue patience. Cultivating patience allows for better decision-making and reduces impulsivity. Therefore, embracing patience ultimately leads to more fulfilling outcomes.
296	18168	7	3	We had been patient enough on the plane ride to @ORGANIZATION1. We had been patient checking in. Now was time for a true test of patience. We sat down at a table in a restaurant of the hotel. Our waitress came over, ordered our drinks and food, then disappeared. We got our drinks and waited for our meal @NUM1 min, @NUM2 min, @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5 min. After an hour we called her over and asked for bread. Lo and behold, she brings bread! We ask her where is our food. She promises to bring it out right away. We wait until we’ve been waiting for @NUM6 hours. We call the manager over to complain, and he brings out the food a minute later. After @NUM6 hours of patience, we finally got our food, proving that sometimes persistence, even after extreme delays, does eventually pay off.
297	18169	7	3	"A time I was patient was when me and my mom and dad and my big brother were going to **DISNEYLAND CALIFORNIA**. We had to pack up and leave in an hour. I wanted to leave **time** for a room and tints and **stuff**. I packed up and **brushed** the **stuff**. So then **I dozed off** during its long ways. Any **who**, I decided to have my head down and wait for a hot **ride** heading my way. So, as I'm dreaming about the lines having no lines so I can get on every **ride** in a hurry, as I'm about to get on a ride, I felt someone **jostling** me, saving **me** as I gained light. It was my brother **gently** shaking **me**. I got up, **confused**. I knew we arrived as a big old sign says welcome to **DISNEYLAND CALIFORNIA**. After all that sleeping, it had paid off after all. So as I think there are no lines, I was heartbroken. The lines was as long as having to **walk** to **CALIFORNIA** itself. Something told me it was going to be a long wait. As I grew impatient, I started to draw. Then somebody grabbed me, it was my mom. She said, ""Why are you **so grumpy**?"" I said, ""Because these lines are the same."" Just be patient it will be worth the wait. That's what I did. Finally, our turn, so I got on and she was right. Being patient in line was worth the wait and it was so much fun to get on. So as I think there are no lines I was heart broken. The line was as long as having to **walk** to **CALIFORNIA** itself. Something told me it was going to be a long wait. As I grew impatient, I started to draw. Somebody grabbed me it was my mom. She said why are you **grumpy** I said because these lines are the same just be patient it will be worth the wait that's what I did. Finally our turn so I got on and she was right being patient in line was worth the wait and it was so much fun to get on. Being patient, even when difficult, ultimately enhanced the overall experience and made the reward that much sweeter."
298	18170	7	3	It was @DATE1 when my family and I went to Cedar Point. It was really exciting and fun. The trip was about three or six hours long. I went to sleep, but when I woke up, we were at Burger King. I ordered a kids meal, and it was good. So, as we got back in the car, I stayed up the rest of the way there. Then I started seeing water parks and hotels; it was really nice. Then I saw this really tall roller coaster. I got really excited that I ran to the line, but they were all long. I had to wait for @NUM1 minutes. When it was my turn, like I was so happy and excited that when I got my stamp, I ran to the @CAPS1-@CAPS2 indoor roller coaster. So I had to wait an hour in line, so I got really tired, but I kept moving forward; when I reached the stairs, finally, I got on the ride. I was kinda scared at the same time because it was dark. Then we took off, then it got off; I was dizzy, but I went on another ride and got dizzier. I got on this ride that rocks side to side; this is the time I was patient, making the most of the day.
299	18171	7	3	"Waiting in the line to Disneyland I complained,"" UGH! When are we going into the park?"". ""Be patient,"" my mother hissed back. ""Being patient is boring!""I complained again ""yeah,"" shouted my sister. ""I'm so bored! Its not and I feel hurt and- ""Quiet!'', shouted my brother. ""Were almost there!"" What seemed like hours, we finally got to the ticket booth."" Finally!"" I meaned. We went inside the park."" What first?"" I asked My sister pointed to a ride. ""That one!"" My sister yelled night before she ran to a ride. We followed my sister to the ride."" Look, lets ride Space Mountain. It looks fun."" said my dad as we walked to the line."" Oh no! More waiting!"" I shouted"" Space Mountain is gonna take forever!"" I complained. Even though the wait was long, riding Space Mountain was definitely worth it."
300	18172	7	3	I showed patience before. I am about to tell you about that time. Two years ago, I worked at my uncle's home to get paid. Working there is tough because he makes you do so much work. I got all of the tall grass cut at his barn, cut wood and a lot more. After around seven hours of hard work, I asked my uncle if I could have my money. He paused when I asked why; he told me he gave a bunch of money to my other uncle for vacation. My heart sunk. I asked him when I was going to get it. He shook his head like he had no idea. Rage filled in me when he looked at me. One week later, I went back to my uncle's house to ask again because I really wanted to buy something. He shook his head no. My mind said patience but my body said no patience. I listened to my mind. Waiting really stunk but I knew patience was the right thing to do; patience brings the best opportunity. Three weeks later, he still hasn't gotten me my money. I heard someone knock on my door. I moved over to it. It was my uncle. He came inside with a huge grin on his face. Suddenly he opened my hand and gave me twenty dollars! “Uncle that’s more than double,” I said, my heart throbbing. “I know but you deserve it.” I was shocked to hear my uncle say that. That day I showed patience. It really did me good to have patience cause I made so much money. Think about my story the next time you don’t wanna show patience, cause it might just pay off.
301	18173	7	3	When I was about nine years old, I took my homework home with me after school. I showed one of my older brothers my homework. He looked at it, then he started helping me with it. Then he did a couple of answers to show me what I had to do because I didn’t really know how to do my homework. So, he had to do his own homework, so he told me to do my homework. So I started to do my homework. I did all of my questions correct. But there was a really hard question on it. I wanted to ask my older brother for help. But instead, I didn’t do that because he was busy doing his work. So I did it myself, figuring it out after some effort, and I was really proud that I managed to solve the difficult problem on my own.
302	18174	7	3	"Middleton middle school, I'm one of their students. My name is ALEX, I'm new here, but you SEPTEMBER think that I'm a boy. Well if you do you better listen and listen hard BECAUSE I'm not going to say this twice; patience is a vurture. On my first day, I walked into MRS. SMITH's class I sat next to a girl with wavy blond hair, sparkling blue eyes, and a genuine smile. ""Hi."" She said. ""my name's LILY."" Lily said in a perky voice. ""Hi."" I said back. ""I'm AMBER, but you can call me ALEX."" ""Nice, uh ALEX."" Lily replied. ""Lily let me show you around."" ""Awesome!"" I answered back. Lily and I became fast friends,but when Lily introduced me to her friends they all made fun of me for having a boy's name. Lily yelled at them, but I said it was okay. Lily just wouldn't let it go. Finally I said to her, ""It's okay Lily! Just let me handle this."" ""Really?"" Lily asked crossing her arms and tapping her foot the way Lily did when Lily couldn't do same thing. ""Because you just don't have any patience!"" I said, getting a little angry Lily couldn't understand. ""Fine be that way ALEX!"" Lily said storming out of the room. ""Lily wait!"" I cried but I had to run after her. ""Lily, please you don't get it. You can't keep getting mad at them for making fun of me. I know your trying to protect me, but its okay. Have you ever had of patience before?"" I asked ready to run if Lily ran from me. ""No."" Lily said, looking down at the scuffed floor. Then, I told her everything I knew about patience and we never had a problem again, because Lily finally understood that my name didn't define who I was and that their teasing wasn't worth getting upset over."
303	18175	7	3	"I was on my way to Tennessee with my family, my older sister Sarah, my younger brother, Michael, and my grandpa and grandma, who I call Granny and Grandpop. We were driving in two different cars; I was with Sarah and my mom in Sarah's white Mercedes. Michael was with Grandpop and Granny in Granny's gold minivan. The windows were down in our car, and Sarah and I were smelling burning rubber. We were in front of the minivan, as we slowed down, Granny pulled to the side of us and told us to pull over. We pulled over, Mom got out, took one look, and said ""We're leaking trannie fluid."" We drove into town with Granny following us. We stopped at an auto shop. We were the only people there. The mechanic told us to get everything we needed out of the car. After we cleaned the car out, he pulled the car up onto the lift, and that's when I saw the garage for the first time. It smelled like gas, everything was greasy and dirty (including the mechanics). ""This is going to ruin our trip,"" I said to Mom. ""We don't know that for sure,"" she replied. It was so hard to sit and be patient. I walked back and forth between the minivan and the garage for about two hours. Some of the other mechanics came, too, but no one could find out what was wrong with our car. Mom got on the computer they had there and looked up car parts, it didn't help. The day before we left, Sarah had taken her car to the local garage for a tune-up. We weren't sure if that was related. After sitting at the shop for about three hours, I got hungry, so did everyone else, so we went to a restaurant across the street for lunch. Mom stayed at the shop for a little while longer than the rest of us. At lunch, Mom said ""We're going to have to call Triple A to come pick up our car. We are going to have to go back home!!"" I was so upset, after all this waiting, we have to go back home. On the way out of the restaurant, I tripped and landed on my wrist. I sprained my wrist, so we went back across the street, and behind the auto shop was a Walmart, so we stopped there, got a bandage for my wrist, and picked out a book to buy. I got the Vampire Diaries, Michael got a Star Wars book. We read them on the way home in Dad's car, a disappointing end to a trip that never truly began."
304	18177	7	3	When I went deer hunting with my dad I was patient. When me and my dad went deer hunting I had to be patient by waiting. The hardest part was being quiet too. I also had to stay still, barely moving a muscle. Being patient is waiting for something you want. I had to be patient because I was waiting for a deer all day, hoping one would appear. Even though I did not get a deer, I was quiet, still, and patient, and that's what mattered.
305	18178	7	3	Finally, all those months of waiting are coming to an end! My mother is going to give me a cell phone! Although it was her old one, it will be new to me, Iíll be able to talk to my friends whenever I want. I will MONTH1 not get the services I want, but at least Iíll have to stop worrying about being late for appointments. Like I said, the waiting is almost over. Okay, so Iím not the most patient person in the world, but this is worth it! You see, Iím going into track, cross-country, and choir. Since I ride the bus home and all of these activities end long after the buses leave, I need someone to pick me up. In order for that to happen, I need a cell phone. My mom said that first, I need to be thirteen. Second, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone, including all her contacts and data. Last of all, I need to prove that I am deticated, I can keep my grades up, and that I am responsible enough to have one. I turned thirteen in DATE1, sheís transferred everything, Iíve proved Iím deticated, Iíve kept my grades up, now I just have to prove that I am responsible. In order to do that, Iíve been watching the neighborís pets while they are away, mowed their lawns, helped babysit their grandchildren, and Iím working on cleaning the house and keeping it clean. So far, Iíve been able to persuade my dad and grandmother that I,m responsible. Even my brother and half-sister think I should have a cell phone! But my mum still isnít sure. I think that if I can clean half of the house and keep it clean until CAPS1, she will finally give me her old cell phone. Iíll probably have to clean up the mess after CAPS1 too though. When I get a cell phone, Iíll have to continue everything Iím doing now. So, I wonít be off the hook or anything, but I will have a little more freedom! I still have a long ways to go but it will all be worth it in the end. I will finally have my own cell phone! This whole process has taught me a lot about responsibility and perseverance, and I know that having the phone will be a great help with my extracurricular activities and keeping in touch with everyone.
306	18179	7	3	Patience is important. Because if you don't have patience you won't get that far in life. If you don't have patience people won't like you at all. And if you don't have patience, you won't be able to fix stuff. You'll get frustrated easily and give up. Therefore, having patience is a valuable trait to cultivate for a more successful and harmonious life.
307	18180	7	3	My story is about the time my mom ran out of gas. My mom was driving down the highway driving home. Soon we started running out of gas. The bad thing is, it was raining. Then we ran out of gas. First she had to get someone to pullover and ask if they had a cell phone. Someone finally did. She asked if they could get gas. Every one said “No!”. My mom then decided to call my dad and ask him to get gas. He then shows up an hour later with a couple gallons of gas. That was just enough to get us home. If my mom had no patience she would of gone crazy, but luckily, we made it home safe and sound.
308	18181	7	3	One day when I was out camping with my friend @PERSON1 I asked him if we could climb the dunes and he said we would do it later. So I waited hours and hours and hours and hours; the sun seemed to be moving at a snail's pace. Then he said after our lunch. Then I asked him after lunch and he said yes. But when is saw the dunes I knew it was a bad idea for me to climb it but I did. After I got to the top, I fell and @CAPS1 stayed there like, a dead animal. After five minute I was good and climbing to the top dune off because after I got up I ran down the dune and when my friend told me to stop I stop I stoped. But I got seed in my coat pocket. Then I hit a rock and did a front flip. Then I fell, when my friend carte down we both lauphed and @CAPS2 back to our campsite, happy to be safe and sound after our adventurous climb.
309	18182	7	3	My name is @CAPS1 and I’m writing about a time I had to be patient. It was a nice @DATE1 @TIME1 in @DATE2 it was the eighteenth and we were going to drive down to @LOCATION1 for a vacation; we were going to @CAPS2 land. Everybody was up in the household packing everything into a Hummer that we rented for the trip so everyone would fit into the car. We had packed all things into the car. My mom made us a good breakfast, a hearty meal of sausage, pancakes, bacon, and scalded eggs. It was delicious. After that, we got into the car and we were on the highway. I had fallen asleep an hour into the drive. By now it was ten o'clock at night, and I woke back up. My sister was yelling at my brother, and then me and my sister got into an argument. My mom told all of us to be quiet, and we did, but we were all getting on each other's nerves. And I had to be patient for another two days, but we got there, and I was glad to be there, so overall it was a fun trip until we had to go back.
310	18183	7	3	I was on the farm waiting for my dad to get home so I could ride my for-wheeler. Then later that night he called me saying he will be later than I was expecting. He came home three hours later. That meant I had to ride my four-wheeler tomorrow because nobody was home exept for my grandma, my dad donít want me to ride my four-wheeler when my dad or my uncle @PERSON1 is not their. At that point I was inpatient. The next day my dad called me saying he had to work late again so I could not ride again. I was impatient even more, but then my uncle @PERSON1 showed up and I asked him if I could ride my four-wheeler and he told me I could if my dad said it was @CAPS1. So I called my dad and he said it was @CAPS1 if my uncle @PERSON1 said it was fine with him. Then I could ride my four-wheeler, and I was not impatient anymore, finally able to enjoy the ride I had been waiting for.
311	18184	7	3	Hunting have in patience in it. Hunting you can't go git a deer. You got to wath. Because deers don't come rith to you. Deer don't like people all so deer came smell you, even if you try to hide your scent. If you not patience you all not git nothing. Therefore, without patience, a successful hunt is impossible.
312	18185	7	3	Last year I had to sell my cow because she was sick. I have been waiting for eight months to get a new calf, but I didn't know where I would get one until I asked my uncle who raises @CAPS1's small cow breed, which normally costs @MONEY2, but he gave me a deal on her for @MONEY1. It took me eight months to find her. But during those eight months, I got anxious and I couldn't sleep very well at night, so when I got her home I was happy I had found her when I did. I still worry about her at night because of the cougar that is roaming the countryside, but I’m glad she’s finally here.
313	18186	7	3	Do you ever like waiting in the line at the store? Well, I don’t also. Well I am going to tell you about a time when I was inpatient and patient. Every morning I have to take the bus to school. I usually get to the bus stop 10 min early, so I can talk with my mother. One day I got up too early. I made it to the bus stop early. 20 min later I decided to go back home. By the time I got home I was going to be late. I hurried at the door, but I was too late, the bus was gone. I should have been more patient. One day I was going to Burger Town to get a hamburger with bacon cheese and toaster. When I got there, there were about 8 people in there, so I decided to wait my turn in line like I had to later. I watched as people paid from the cash register. When it was finally my turn, I ordered my burger and when I was done it was worth the wait. In conclusion you have to be patient in everything you do. Sports, school or home and even in public, I hope my story made you realize how important it is to be patient.
314	18187	7	3	A time I was patient was in July 2017 at the Vans Warped Tour. I was about 16 in the afternoon when we claimed our seats right in front of the stage. We waited about 45 minutes till the first band came on stage, the name of their band was Belmont. Their appearance was strange so they looked like a rock band. But they were just a regular band that played normal music. They played songs I've never heared of ever but now I hear them more frequently now. The second bad was another one I never heard of. I can't remember their names, but they wern't my taste of music. The next band was one I new lots about; their name is the Wonder Years, they were great. There lead lead singer had a long beared and an afro, it was very funny. They seemed to go the quickest because I enjoyed them so much. Next was another singer I have heard of his name was Machine Gun Kelly, he was also great. He even made up a song at the top of his head about Cleveland and never stoped for like four minutes. Then he was done and the time was about 9 PM at night by now. And I was getting tired. But right there I saw the WATERPARKS boys getting ready I was really excited, they opened up with a song named BLONDE. And there was strobe lights and regular lights every were. The staid that was holding the drum even moved. It did circles, and a flips. It went 5 feet in the air and did flips and everything you can imagine. Their lead singer Awsten and their drummer even had a drum off, that was cool. That went till about 10:30 it was amazing. I will probly never whiteness something like that ever again! It was an unforgettable experience that tested my patience but was ultimately worth it, creating lasting memories.
315	18189	7	3	Being patient is hard sometimes but easy others. Like @CHRISTMAS for example. I always get up really early on @CHRISTMAS morning and lay on the couch. Same with my brother. We get up round @4 am and turn on the @CHRISTMAS tree. Then our eyes light up because we get loose all the presents we get to open. First we lay on the couch and stare at them trying to figure out what we got. Then we find another chair and stare at them at a different angle. We do that until we both end upon the couch again. We get yelled at once or twice to go back to bed. But it does no use because we never do. Then about @5 am we start getting gosy. We go into our bedrooms and try to find something to do to keep our minds off of it, but that never works raither. Then we go back on the couch. About @6 am we go into our kitchen and make coffee for our mom and dad because they say they always need there coffee before we open presents. then we go and wake them up. When they finally crawl out of bed we rush them to drink their coffee so we can see what we got. Finally about @30 min later they finish and let us open our presents. It took so long, but it pays off in the end.
316	18190	7	3	When l was patient l was in the car and my mom went to get something at the store and l went whith her. I was patient because l didnít tell her when are we gonna go home or this is so boring. I tried to go whith the flow. I was there for one hour but did I care no because l was the one who wanted to come whith and l came. If l would of complained then she would of said then ìwhy did you come.î So at the end my mom said since you have been patient then you can get a chocolate bar so if your patient, there might be a reward at the end.
317	18191	7	3	When I was very patient was the time I had to get my teeth pulled. It had taken two hours. They would take a break for about @NUM1 minutes every half an hour. I had gotten many shots in my mouth, and they had ripped my gum open and took out two teeth, then my two bottom teeth. I was patient then. They even said I was one of their best kids because of everything I had went through in my mouth and the long time. This was the time I got @NUM2 teeth pulled and was very patient, showing how well I handled a difficult situation.
318	18192	7	3	ìWhen can I drive?î I whined. ìWhen the time comes you have to be patient, otherwise you wonít,î yelled my DAD over the loud, heart warming sound of ENGINES. Starting up for the 1st time that year. I loved that sound. Itís my second favorite sound. The vibrations rattling my legs as it races away with JOHN driving. I could wait until my turn. After 2 rides and 20 mins DAD said the words I thought heíd never say,î OKAY, your turn.î I looked at him then the truck. Wow does he look small next to that truck. I ran as fast as I could down to the pit. I climbed onto the tires rim, then to the, top of the tire, and into the cab. ìBUCKLE UP, PUT ON YOUR SEATBELT, READY TO GO, gaggag GO. Oh yeah! This felt right. I couldnít go fast but I almost tipped it over. So thatís a good thing. So all in a nut shell, patience comes a long way.
319	18193	7	3	I don’t have much patience, but I’ll tell you a story about a time that I did. It was a sunny day outside and it was Tuesday after school and I had no homework. So I invited my friends over and we were going to Landslide Skate Park. We were all at my home but MARK wasn’t. My mom said “MARK if he's not here in two minutes we have to go without him”. So I was mad I was writing a note to put on the door that reads “MARK, we had to go without you because you were late! Sorry be on time next time.-ME”. But when I was signing the note he pulled up. That was the story when I had patience, if only for a little while, because I was truly about to leave him behind.
320	18194	7	3	One time in @DATE1, I was taking a test called the @ORGANIZATION1 (@CAPS1). Me, and my friends get down with the @ORGANIZATION1 early, finding our seats and preparing our materials. So we had to be patient too, waiting for the exam to begin. We had alot that we could do, but the choices were limited – rereading notes, quietly chatting, or just staring into space. Being patient is hard, sometimes it feels like ages have gone by, but really @NUM1 minutes have gone by; sometimes patience requiers a lot of mental peace and focus. One time me, and my dad were going to work in @LOCATION1. The bus was late @NUM2 minutes, but it felt like a few weeks, making us anxious about being on time. Sometimes patience is good and bad. Good patience is when a team scores a goal; the audience was patient enough so that the team could score a goal, building up the excitement. A bad patience is when youíre late to work, and traffic, or the bus was late, or you could wait, making you feel stressed and unproductive. Sometimes you can distract yourselves while being patient, texting, calling a friend, or talking or playing a game, with a kid or with yourselves, to make the time pass more quickly. So you see that patience can be good or bad, also requiers a lot of mental peace to handle different situations. @ORGANIZATION1 tests our knowledge, but also our ability to remain calm and focused under pressure.
321	18195	7	3	When I was around the age of 8. I went to California with my grandpa, grandma, mom, and dad for a family reunion, we stopped so menny times I cant even count. I think it was to eat, but I did not want to stop or be patient because I wanted to get there and see what everything looked like like it was big but the dad post was we hade to leave are dog home for a week, was in patient to get home to because as soon as I got home I was going to sleep. We got up to leave from are house at 5:00 am and we got to the motel at 3:00 am the after noon I was sick of sitting in the car I did not want to get back in the car to go home because if you think of it that is long ways to white in the car. I was very impatient because if I could of gotten there in a half of a hour or a have would have been a lot better than like, 22 hours of time but it was a lot of fun to see new things that you have never seen befor on your way there because on are way home. I was just sleeping. But I was not very patient I was so board that every stop I would switch cars and I did not have tating at that time but I did have my GAMEBOY until it died then I made my I pod and my cells all I could do was call and play games on that but I was so impatient at the corner to cuzz I rather go to the hotel and sleep than sit there lission to older people talk bout what has happened. I donít know hardly any of them I could not tell you who every one was, and that's why I was so eager to get back home.
322	18196	7	3	I was patient this one time while waiting to get on the computers, and I told my mom to wake me if she got off the computer. After an hour, I fell asleep, and I woke up after a little while to find my brother was on for three hours reading manga we already have. After three minutes, my dad kicked me off to check his email, saying he would be off soon, yet he spent the rest of the day and a bit more of the next day watching Indearath Star for six hours. That's in addition to the eight hours he spends on a connection at work, so that adds 6 to 8 hours on the internet every day of the year, showcasing a frustrating imbalance in computer usage.
323	18197	7	3	There was this guy that I liked a lot that I finally had the courage to ask out after 2 years and 3 Ω weeks. He said yes to go to the dance with me but no to going out. So a little while later like a week later I asked him again. He told me give him till the end of the week. So I waited and waited and on and on it seemed like forever. Then my friend just couldn't take it she asked him on December 1st and he said yes! A million yes, joy came from his mouth. Then December 8th, after getting to know me better he broke up with me. We have been fighting ever since, but we're still besties, showing that even after romantic disappointment, strong friendships can endure.
324	18198	7	3	Being patient is hard and not all people are patient, but patience is an important thing to do. You have to be patient almost everywhere you go, like waiting in line is being patient. You have to be patient with people to, like people who are learning or you are teaching. I was patient in Disneyland which was really hard to do. When I was really little maybe four or five years old, we went to Disneyland. My older sister wanted to go on a ride but I couldn’t go because I was to short. So my mom stayed with me while my older sister and my DAD went on the ride. I was so sad but my mom told me to wait and not get antsy. After a while I started asking “When is the ride going to be over mama” she kept responding “I don’t know, whenever PERSON1 and DAD get off the ride.” GOSH I couldn’t wait, but when my DAD and sister got off they told my mom that they wanted to go again. My mom said “ok” and that's when I got sad then she said to me “but because you waited so long and nicely I will take you to get a smoothy.” “I love smoothys” I scream. Patience is important, because I was so patient my mom got me something I love. Patience is a hard thing to do but once you got it, it’s a good thing to do, as demonstrated by the reward I received for waiting patiently.
325	18200	7	3	"Last year I went to the doctors to get a normal check up when she tested my vision and hearing and felt the cold too. She put the stethoscope on my chest to see if my heart was okay. After that she checked my neck. I could feel her icy cold fingers on my neck; about a minute had passed and she says she will be right back. Another doctor came in and felt it until finally my mom asks ""what's going on here"". They said the glands in my neck were full and they said I needed to have my blood checked to see if I had a thyroid issue, as the thyroid are glands in your neck. If the thyroid is not functioning correctly it leads to having to take pills for the rest of your life. So a few days later we went to get my blood checked. As we waited I started to get really nervous, I had butterflies really bad, and then five minutes passed which seemed like an hour. They called me in and I sat down, the nurse said everything will be fine. So I trusted her. She took a rubber tube and tied it around my arm, it sorta hurt like a pinch, then one, two, three, four and the needle went in and I seen the blood going into the tube, really cool, then we went home. It took a week with sleepless nights because I was so anxious and they called my mom which felt like it took about a year, not really. I could not tell by her expression, then she said no and that was so happy and I was being patient which was what kept me from not wanting to run down there and seeing the results myself! In the end, everything was fine, and my thyroid was healthy, relieving my anxiety."
326	18201	7	3	ìWhen do ve get the xbox!î I asked @CAPS1. ì@CAPS2 hours,î he replied. ì@CAPS3!î ìyes.î ì@CAPS4.î ì@CAPS4.î @CAPS2 hoursÖ. I thought, this is gonna feel like a week. First, I got on the computer. After ten minutes I got off because nothing was ???. Next I looked at the t.v guide. Nothing. Why am I so tired! I thought. It must be that I didÖ, I was thinking but luckily, I fell asleep. I woke up. Four hours left. Once again I looked at the t.v guide still nothing. I just turned the t.v on. A @PERSON1 just ended. ì@CAPS7 up next on @CAPS8 land is The @PERSON1,î the @CAPS8 commercial said. ì@CAPS10 see this,î I said out loud. It turned out better than I thought. It was a no color @PERSON1 that was about a police official and his son. After watching four hours of the @PERSON1, I heard the goings door open.

It must be that I did… I was thinking but luckily, I fell asleep. I woke up. Four hours left. Once again I looked at the TV guide still nothing. I just turned the TV on. A movie just ended. ìComing up next on Cartoon land is The Detective,î the Cartoon commercial said. ìI have to see this,î I said out loud. It turned out better than I thought.

327	18202	7	3	One time my brother @PERSON1 was patient. Patience is being understanding and listening through difficulties without complaining. Our family lived in @LOCATION1 and were going to Cedar Point on vacation. We had fun all day and at @NUM1 we went on @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1 went on the blue @ORGANIZATION1 while the rest of the family went on the red. The blue keeps you up at the top for @NUM2 and drops you while the red one shoots you up to @NUM3 feet. The line for the red @ORGANIZATION1 was shorter than the blue one so we got to go on first. Once the ride was over @PERSON1 was already at the top of the blue @ORGANIZATION1. We heard a loud sound that meant the blue @ORGANIZATION1 cast was coming down. But the blue cast wasn't coming down. @PERSON1 was stuck at the top, @NUM4 feet in the air. @PERSON1 got a bird’s eye view of the park. I would have been scared if I were @PERSON1. At @NUM5 the ride lights came on and the cast plummeted down. Finally, he got a ride. Each rider got free season passes to Cedar Point. This is a time when @PERSON1 needed to show patience.
328	18203	7	3	On @DATE1 we went to the dollar tree. I wanted to go to the GameStop. But I was patient, and then we went to the GameStop.
329	18205	7	3	In the beginning, I woke up from sleeping and felt real sick, so I took a shower and put on my clothes. I told my dad “can I go to the doctor because I feel sick?” He said “we will leave at 9 am” and it was 7 am. Then, I had to wait on the couch while my brothers, my dad and my mom were taking showers. After that, I wanted to yell and complain because they were going too slow and tried acting beautiful. I didn’t. When they finished they had to look for the keys until they found it. It was 10 am and my dad’s favorite music was on so we stayed and watched the whole movie. In the middle, it was 11 am and then we went to the doctor and had to stay waiting for everyone to get there turn until it was 1 pm which is our turn. We actually made an appointment. They checked what was bothering me and it was nothing. I left and I still waited until my brothers finished. In the end, I was pissed off because I had to wait for them to get in the car. My dad said “Are you happy? You said that you feel sick and there is nothing wrong with you.” we went home thinking that I had been patient for the whole day. I was saying to myself “I learned my lesson and it is if you are patient the day can go fast.” In conclusion, the experience, though frustrating, taught me the value of patience.
330	18206	7	3	Over the summer of 2023 I went to Chicago, Illinois, and Springfield to visit my aunt Susan. Dad got up early and drove to the airport. It was the first time I was going to go on a plane. My dad said I better have patience or else the ride was going to be boring. Me and my sister got on the plane and flew to Los Angeles and it took 45 minutes and that was easy, but then Dad got on another plane and went directly to Grandpa Joe and that took 5 hours. It was a very long ride, but I had patience, but my sister didn't have any patience at all; the whole ride she was asking when Dad were going to get there. And that was the time I had patience.
331	18207	7	3	"A time I was patient. We were going to go camping, so I got packed up and locked the car. The ride was 4 hours long so I had to be patient. I played video games ps 5 for a couple of minutes it was fun. I left early so I could do some thing when I got there. Then I tried to sleep I was so tired. But I couldn't with my cousins John and Mike screaming and yelling, I finally fell asleep. Then I hit a bump and our car was out of gas luckily we were right in front of a gas station it took an hour to get it fixed, so I snacked on a little thing and I left. Then my cousins got all excited saying ""The we are almost there!"" I was happy I could put up the tent and go to sleep. I saw our camp ground and when we got there I had to put every thing up I had to be patient to go to sleep. Then the kids found a path and of cores, they wanted to go my mom, wanted me to take them I was so tired I didn't want to go hiking! So I stayed at camp. Mike yelled the park was pretty close to the camp site me can I ate quickly on a quit if as possible and fank is the tant car and went to sleep."
332	18208	7	3	"I was patient when I was going to Cedar Point. We took a bus; it took seven hours. So my friend John decided to watch movies on the tablet. We watched ""Street Dreams"" and ""The Incredibles."" We were still a long way from Cedar Point. We decided to call my mom for a prank call. It was hilarious, so we did it again. Then we took turns napping and watching the big open road. Eventually, we both fell asleep. When we woke up, we were there. This is the time I waited patiently. Because I waited patiently then, I don't mind waiting now. I learned to do something else while waiting. Now I can wait longer. This helped in my future, showing me the value of occupying my time and developing patience."
333	18209	7	3	I was patient during the meap. I was patient because I was done early and a lot of people were not done yet. When I get done early I like to draw or do some of my work but I didnt have any work so I knew then when every one got done we waited for 5 min then we start the meap again when I got done with that noone else was done so I waited for 2 or 3 min then every one was done then we stretched walked around for 4 min then we sit back down and start the part 3 when we are done we get to do work I am usually the first one done. Then when I get done with the test I get up and walk around so I can get A's and B's on my tests like meap test because it is so important to get good grades and when you are patient you will find out to get good grades like A's and B's. Being patient really helps me focus and do my best, ultimately leading to those good grades.
334	18210	7	3	"On my last trip at Cedar Point I made a horrible mistake. I waited in line for two hours on the Mantis. I had to be patient, but it was hard to because the mister fans were having technical difficulties. And how can I be patient when it is 92 degrees outside?! The only good part of the line was the shade. That was one way I kept my patience. ""I told my self, ""and in no time you will be there."" But I spoke too soon. Half an hour seemed like four hours, but I think the heat was just getting to me. Finally, after five hours in line the mist fans began to lift. Patience can bring luck. I wait for what seems like only ten minutes but actually was an hour. After I got off the ride, I was relieved. I guess patience in some ways, is the key to success."
335	18211	7	3	One day a man named @PERSON1 had a doctorís appointment and over slept; when @PERSON1 got out of bed he saw that he was late for his doctorís appointment. As @PERSON1 got out of bed he rushed in the bathroom to take a quick shower, as if he had time. @PERSON1 noticed it was grilling later so he didnít get to wash up or brush his teeth, so he grabbed a part of gum on the way out the door. @PERSON1 finally got to the doctors, went inside and saw there were millions of people in the waiting room, he went to go check his name in and sat down. He started to get frustrated and tired of waiting, so he calmed down and realized patience. @PERSON1 kept his self busy for two whole hours playing with his phone and many apps he downloaded. @PERSON1 was so busy he didnít realize that he was the last person still waiting. Other people had their check-ups and left and others just left without theirs. Finally, they called in @LOCATION1 for his appointment. As @PERSON1 was going in he put @NUM1, maybe @NUM2 pieces of gum in his mouth and started talking. @PERSON1 was done, zoomed home, flew into his the shower, and brushed his teeth, got back in the bed and went to sleep, relieved the long day was finally over.
336	18212	7	3	Patience is very difficult for me. Having patience is very difficult for me, because I am not patient at all: I cannot wait for things. During school, I am always looking at the clock. I just can’t wait for class to be over most of the time. Sometimes I think I rush things a little bit too much, especially when I'm eager to start a new project. I wish I was patient, but I'm not. I'm not patient because I think about what comes after the waiting; I get too curious about the outcome. For example: in class I get excited for when the day ends, picturing what I'll do afterward. Some day, I want to improve on my waiting style, though I know it will take effort. I don’t think that will happen anytime soon, but I hope to gradually develop more patience over time.
337	18213	7	3	Patience is very important at my house. My mother always says you have to be able to patient to succed in anything. One time I was at home on the computer. I was surfing the web and enjoying it. My mom yelled across the house for me to come see her. I got out of my chair, walked through the kitchen, through the hallway and into her bedroom. She said that she had to go to the store to get some groceries. She was wondering if I wanted to go with her. I said no and asked her if she would make myself a sanawich. She replied yes and left. While she was gone I cleared my room, folder laundry and watched television. It was about an hour later and she still wasnít home. I was very hungry and beginning to become worried about her. I was tempted to call her but then I remembered what she always says be patient to succed. About a half an hour later she got home. She had bought me some lunch meat so I could make a sandwich. While I was eating she told me she was proud of me on how patient I was while she was gone. This made me feel good. I think patience is very important. I also think everyone could use a little more of it, because it can really make a difference in how we handle challenges.
338	18215	7	3	Patients, in my way of saying it, is a person that waits a while if she needed to. The only reason I'm putting this in my own way is because no one is patient in my family. Patience is a person where if they were stuck in traffic then they'll be able to sit and wait, or there's a really long wait or line, they can handle that. Or they'll be able to wait for something they need, even if it takes time. Patience is just waiting for my turn, I should put it. It's about waiting if I have to, or if something runs out and they have to wait for it to come and get it. That's what patience means to me in my own way, just the ability to wait calmly when needed.
339	18217	7	3	I had been working everyday in the summer. I was trying to do the best I could to make money. I was saving up to by a three hundred dollar bow, a fifty dollar target, forty dollar broadheads, and other hunting accessories. I was finding myself to get more impatient everyday. Slowly I was getting tired of working, bored of saving money, and tempted to spend it on other things. Finally I saved up enough money. I bought my stuff from the local sporting goods store. I practiced all day long in my backyard. Soon I became more accurate. I was ready to go hunting in the woods behind my house. The first night I was out I passed up a doe at eight yards because I wanted to wait for a buck. I haven’t had anything close enough to shoot since then, and my impatience has now shifted to wanting to get a deer.
340	18218	7	3	One time when I was patient was when the shot flew was going around. I had to go to this one place to get the flew shots. When we got there we got in line, I had to be patient because the line was really long is the line to get through. We brought chairs, hot coco, and stuff to do to keep us any feet. I had to be patient until I got to the front of the line. The worse part was that most of the time was outside and it was New Year’s Eve, so I had to be patient in the cold, when we finally got inside the building I was so happy. Then about 3 hours we got to the front of the line. I’m glad that I never have to wait in line for three hours to get a flew shot again.
341	18219	7	3	I was patient in my game, but it took too long. I got so mad, so I punched my big tree because it was making me mad. Then my mom came up. She hinted I clean down the stairs. I got my mom money, and she bought me trail mix. My house, she took to her way. I am patient now. The end. I'm patient to go to lunch. I got @NUM1 before lunch, so I got @NUM2 houses to go to lunch, so don't take prep for some guess. Now @NUM3 hours I'll lunch. I'm mad to wait. It's @NUM4 till lunch now. When is doing the test? So forgot to ask for some game over. It is @NUM5 we go to lunch. It @NUM6 we got to lunch. Now heard line I got to be patient for a little longer. She made my salad so good. I ate all of it, then drank my milk. Then we tried to be patient for something. My taken mis greetings, I was happy than ever. That day taught me that even when patience wears thin, good things often come to those who wait, and the reward is often worth the wait, ultimately leading to happiness.
342	18220	7	3	One time I was patient was when I was at basketball practice. It didn’t happen until the end, right after a particularly grueling set. No one knew that this was going to happen. It just happened out of nowhere. I hit the wall. I had an accident. We were running suicides, a common conditioning drill. I was running too fast and I couldn’t stop. I went head-first into the wall. It was a brick wall too, which made things worse. I didn’t panic because I knew I had to be patient. I had to wait on a lot of things. I had to wait on an ambulance, which took a long time to arrive. I had to wait on a doctor to give me stitches, which thankfully didn’t take long once they arrived. Lastly, I had to wait on the doctor to give me the discharge papers so I could finally go home. It happened here at @ORGANIZATION1, during an after-school practice. We were in the gym for basketball practice. It was in the @DATE1, but I can’t remember the exact date, it was a blur. I was also in the sixth grade at the time. It happened because I couldn’t stop in time; my momentum was just too great. When I hit my head, surprisingly, it didn’t hurt initially. When I got my stitches, some parts hurted quite a bit, especially as the needle went in. When they took them out, it didn’t hurt at all. But I had a massive headache for days afterward. I was definitely glad when everything was over and I could finally rest and recover.
343	18221	7	3	I am a very patient person. An example are games. For some games you have to wait weeks, or months, for updates or new content to arrive. For others you might have to wait years for a highly anticipated sequel to be released. I have done this before, demonstrating my ability to persevere and remain engaged even with prolonged periods of waiting.
344	18222	7	3	"I have had to be patient many times in my life. One that I can remember was waiting in a long line for opening of ""Willow Creek Haunted Orchard's Haunted Hayride and Maze"" for this Halloween season. The line must have at least 100 people. This is one of the largest apple orchard in the area I lived in. It was my first time going, but my sister had gone before, countless times. She said that it was one of the scariest things she had ever been to. She brought a friend with her also. Her name is Jessica. The opening was going to be at 7:00 PM, and it was only 6:30 PM, the line still growing behind us. My heart was pumping faster and faster. I glanced at my watch almost every 30 second. Time seemed to forget to keep ticking. Finally, it was 7:00 PM. That was when we heard an announcement. Beep! ìAttention ladies and gentlemen! I am sad to announce that we will be opening up Haunted Hayride and Maze in 15 more minutes. Iím sorry. Thanks for your cooperationî click. I heard everyone in the line groan. A lot of the people just left to come back tomorrow. Andrew, Jessica and I just sat down to wait it out. Then finally, we heard one last announcement. Beep! ìAttention once again! Are you ready for some scary thrills? Then come on in! Itís time for Haunted Hayride Opening Night!î That was my story of being patient. Ultimately, the delayed opening made the eventual experience even more exciting and memorable."
345	18223	7	3	Waiting for my child was the longest @NUM1 hours of my life. I had been in the waiting room for nearly the whole time. The nurses kept giving me updates, to calm me, to no avail. So I @CAPS1 pulled out a smoke to ease my nerves. I didnít know if my wife, or our baby would live. Would it live happy? I just @CAPS1 took a puff of smoke, and waited for hours I sat, shutting out the rest of the world to shield my own thoughts. Would it be picked on? I sat, ignoring the nurses pleading, trying to reassure me that everything was proceeding as expected. Would it shut life out? I sat, waiting for my newborn child. My silence was broken, by a baby crying. I rushed over to my wifeís room, to find her holding a beutiful baby girl. ì@CAPS1 kept you long enoughî she whispered, exhaustion and joy evident in her eyes, finally bringing an end to my torment.
346	18225	7	3	"A time that I had patience is when my family went to [Adventureland] and [we] are inline to go on Shiver Me Timbers, the biggest coaster at the park. ""[We] are in line,"" I said to a kid that had cut in front of my friend [John] and I as [we] went up the ramp to get on the ride. The kid went to the back of the line that just got longer, [adults] and kids screamed. As [we] got up to the top of the ramp the ride had messed up so [we] sat there for about an hour, and then they fixed it. [We] get in and I took off my glasses. The ride started. [We] went up the biggest hill, then smaller then smaller! Then a turn then, the last hill, exciting like a diver going [60] mph, the ride was over. That was a time I had patience."
347	18226	7	3	We were driving to Asheville. My uncle lived there so since he always came to our house we were going to his new house. I was excited about going there, but there was one problem, it was over a ten hour drive. My parents woke me up the morning we were leaving and I felt so tired. I looked at the clock and it said six thirty a.m. I knew we weren't bringing a lot of food and things so we went to get packed up and in the van but it took longer that it seemed like it would last. My dad said we would leave around seven thirty but it was an hour more that we planned. We got all packed up and we were on the road. It was about an hour in I fell asleep in the back seat. We made a stop an hour and a half later and I woke up. After we got back me and my bother watched a movie on our portable dvd player. We kept driving there and I knew it would take a while but I kept my patience and fell asleep most of the time. When we got there it was great. Their house was up in a mountain, I had fun visiting them and we walked around town went into stores. I had fun seeing my uncle and aunt. This was the time I was patient.
348	18227	7	3	A time I was patient was when my family went to Six Flags Hurricane Harbor adventures and we all wanted to go on the lazy river water slide, the biggest water slide there. It had the longest line ever; it made a swirl and my family was at the end of the swirl. It was early morning when we had finally get in and went to the lazy river water slide. It was huge, just about 75 feet tall. And we got in line and only a half an hour had gone by when my mom left it. Then another half an hour had gone by when my older brother left. Now it was only my other brother, my sister, and my dad left in line. When someone got hurt on the ride, they shut it down for two hours. Finally, they opened up the ride again, so now my other brother and sister did not come with us. So now it is only my dad and me left in the line now. So it was our turn on the ride next when my dad got scared and left, so it was me and an old man went on the same little float. The old man met his match, and I was so happy to finally get on, proving that my patience was well-rewarded in the end.
349	18228	7	3	Patience is very important; it can help you be successful in many things. In school patience is very important because some things just have to wait, such as waiting for test results or understanding a difficult concept. Being patient in the game of chess or checkers is important because while the other person makes his or her move you can be thinking of what move you will make to counter attack it, requiring careful thought and planning. Patience is very important when playing games or doing schoolwork. Patience is also about waiting. For example, everyone is excited on Christmas eve and can’t wait till morning but they have to be patient and wait till morning. Also on your birthday you don’t know what you’ll get but instead of peeking you have to be patient until you can open the presents up. Patience is a very helpful skill to have, and cultivating it can lead to greater rewards and positive outcomes in various aspects of life.
350	18229	7	3	ìYay! Today is the day we get to go to Disney point,î said excitedly @PERSON1 exclaimed. ìCome on @PERSON1, lets get this show at the road.î Dad announced. The family were planning a vacation to go to Disney point a week long and today is the day they got to go. The family got all of their suitcases and piled them in the car. When everything was situated, they took off. ìHey Mom, how long is this drive gonna take?î Lily, @PERSON1ís older sister, asked. ìHoney, about six hours sweetie.î Mom replied. The family lived in Florida, so they had to drive along way to get to California.ìMom!!! I canít survive six hours in a car!!!. ìCome on Lily, you wanted to come here, you just have to have patience like said @PERSON1 here.î ìI guess I will not wait.î After about three hours in the car Lily kept repeatedly asking the question ìAre we there yet?î Even though the answer was always ìNo,î she asked it anyways. said @PERSON1 eventually got annoyed of this and shouted ìstop it! Just have some patience!î,ìFine, Fine,î Lily replied, ìI will stop.îAfter about two more hours, they finally arrived. The parents bought the tickets and asked their children what ride they wanted to go on. They both smiled and said ìThe rollercoaster.î At last, they walked up to the line, and waited. They just waited, and waited. Some more. After what seemed like four hours waiting in line, Lily gave up and shouted ìI donít want to wait in line anymore! I am leaving!î So the family walked back into the car, and drove off. When they got settled, @PERSON1 told Lily, ìAll it takes is some patience and you can have some fun.î Lily didnít respond, but perhaps she understood the value of patience for future adventures.
351	18230	7	3	One day @PERSON1's mom, ìMomî decided to go shopping and @PERSON1 desperately wanted to go. But his mom kept saying ìNoî. So @PERSON1 begged and begged so his mom finally said, ìFine but you cant complainî so @PERSON1 went shopping with his mom. Then @PERSON1 and his mom arrived at the store. Just about five minutes later @PERSON1 said. ìIím bored can we go nowî, his mom said ìI told you Noî just be patient. @PERSON1 then said,î patient you want me to be patient we've been here for like five hoursî, we have only been here for ten minutes. I have no more patients said @PERSON1. So so his mom made a deal with @PERSON1 it was, if you be good for five more minutes we will go to the ice cream place. The next five minutes made his mom go crazy with every second @PERSON1 saying, Iím bored can we go now and hurry up. Finally @PERSON1 and his mom left. They got in the car and drove right past the ice cream place, @PERSON1 said, ìwaitî we past it, his mom said I know. @PERSON1 saidî we made a deal, remember. It is mom said yup but you broke the deal, so what did you learn. @PERSON1 said that when you make a deal sign a contract, his mom said, ìNoî, patience is a virtue that you need to learn. So that is my story about patience in my own way. Ultimately, @PERSON1 learned that patience is a valuable lesson, even if it wasn't learned in the way he expected.
352	18231	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I took the @CAPS1 test in @NUM1 grade. In my class there was only @NUM2 @NUM1 graders while the rest were @NUM4, so we tested in the principal's office. That was the day when we had to take a writing part. They are hard and take a while. When we started some people rushed as fast as they can to get done. I took my time to plan what I was going to write about. We had lots of time so you shoud use the most of your time to make everything good. To do this you have to be patient with yourself. This means that you should look over your answers again and make sure you have it correct. When I done with the writing section, I went over it to make sure I had everything right. I had plenty of time. When I was done correcting my work I waited for everyone else to be done as well by reading. That was the time when I was patient. I think being patient helped me do my best on the test, as I wasn't stressed or rushed.
353	18232	7	3	"Patience is everything, ever hear these words! When you're waiting in line for a fast food restaurant, or when you're stuck in traffic. You’re annoyed and angry, but then those words come to your mind. ""Patience is everything."" One time I was waiting in the longest line ever, waiting to see the ordering counter! I was in a rush; I had a class I had to get to in five minutes. When I could see the counter, I saw the employees rushing around trying frantically to get all the orders out. Then I saw the reason for the hold-up. There was an old man at the front of the line trying desperately to order. I didn’t blame him; with all those choices, he didn’t know what to pick. The rest of the line wasn’t as patient. ""Hurry up,"" one said. ""Come on!"" another shouted. I just waited patiently thinking the line wasn’t really being fair. I suggested a choice for him, and he ordered. Sure, I was ten minutes late for my class, but I was patient and understanding towards the old man, and what comes around goes around, they say, so the rest of the day I felt good about my good deed, knowing that sometimes, a little patience can make a big difference."
354	18233	7	3	"Are you always or even sometimes patient? If not, that's normal. But everyone on @LOCATION1 should be patient. It will help you in the long run. If you and I were patient our world would be a little bit easier. Like if your brother, for an instance, was in your bathroom and you had to use it, you could wait for him to finish. That is saving arguing, and it's being patient. I say these things like ""I'm patient!"" but that would be a lie, because I am far from it! It's not saying it's easy, but we can all try. Even small attempts at patience can make a difference in our daily interactions and overall well-being, fostering smoother relationships and reducing unnecessary stress."
355	18234	7	3	@PERSON1 was a hamster. One day @PERSON1 was out of his cage playing with his owners’ sister hamster, @PERSON1. @PERSON1 had just got a brand new hamster toy. @CAPS5 had a bunch of tubes to climb in and a slide and running wheel. @PERSON1 wished he had one, @CAPS1 his owner didn’t have enough money yet. Even when @PERSON1 played in his, he still wanted one. @CAPS5 was very hard for @PERSON1 to wait, especially when @PERSON1 saw @PERSON1 playing in his. This is the story of when @PERSON1 was talking to @PERSON1, “I really wish I had one of those hamster toys,” said @PERSON1. “@CAPS1 my owner doesn’t have enough money!” “@CAPS2’t worry,” said @PERSON1. “You can play in mine until he does. I hear he’s almost got enough.” “@CAPS3, I guess, that’s close enough.” A few days later, @PERSON1 got the brand new toy, never than @CAPS4, “I guess @CAPS5 was worth waiting!” @CAPS5 was twice as big than @PERSON1’s, so they could share. And they both lived happily ever after. This shows that patience and sharing can lead to a joyful outcome for everyone involved.
356	18235	7	3	"Patience is when you don't complain when you're bored or waiting for something. For example (for your convenience I will be writing a story about patience, please take note that this story is completely untrue) I was walking home and saw an elderly woman; she was having trouble with her groceries. I wanted to help her but all I was thinking about was my cousin who would be arriving at my house any moment now. I walked up to the woman and asked if she needed help and she replied ""if you could, I live over there"" she pointed to a large tan house. I carried her things to the door. ""There you go,"" I said. ""Would you mind helping me put them away?"" the woman asked. I thought about how my mother never wanted me to go into a stranger's house, but I sort of knew her, so I said that I would help, the woman smiled. I then picked up the bags and said, ""Is your home unlocked?"" ""It's not"" she replied, ""Where are your keys?"" I asked. ""I believe they're lost somewhere in the lawn"". I searched for about a half hour, then I found them under a bush. He brought the keys to her and said ""There you go,"" she opened the door and he helped her with her groceries. When they were all put away I said ""I ought to be going."" ""Not without someway I can repay you"" said the woman ""Go find my purse."" I waited and waited, it had to have been an hour. The woman came out of the kitchen with some change. ""It's only change, I couldn't find my wallet"" she said and gave him the change. I left feeling like a good person because he was patient with the woman. I told his mom about his good deed and his cousin got to stay longer. This was my example of patience, if this ever happens to you make sure you're patient and know the person. Being patient in this scenario led to a positive outcome, reinforcing the value of patience."
357	18236	7	3	One day coming home, we were stopped AT a train crossing. I train, one train. Only the first train was moving... or so we thought. After the first train, a very large train came AT us. In the car was he and my old friend sat in the car for at least 10 mints, but the train showed no signs of ending. But then suddenly it stopped, the train stopped dead in its tracks. We thought of turning around, but the other cars were back blades in about 2 mints... the train began slowly starting. Soon after 3 mints, the train ended. After the crossing went up, we started driving, but another train was coming. So my dad put the car to the metal and sped it out of there; we were so patient. I'll say, we spent 40 mints, almost an hour of waiting! But we were patient, and that seemed like the longest date ever. In the end, our patience paid off, and we were able to continue our journey home, relieved that the long wait was finally over.
358	18237	7	3	When we drive to Grandma's I have to be patient. When we are in the car I really have to be patient because it takes 8 hours plus the extra time we spend going to the restroom, out for lunch, plus we stay for the night. But when we are on the road it is so long, That is how I need to be patient. I have to bring a car bag to entertain me. It contains a book, ped of paper. My dad’s laptop also. A big factor is my iPod. Especially I don’t like that my legs got all numb and the seat hurts. I hate that feeling. But at the end result I love visiting, you just have to be patient enough to get there and the end factor is the best.
359	18238	7	3	One day at my school, it was lunchtime, and I was very hungry. The lunchroom was filled with kids, a sea of chattering voices and shuffling feet. I could hear my stomach growl; I was so hungry. I stood for ten minutes, feeling the minutes stretch on, then I started thinking maybe I could cut in line. But no, I didn't. It felt like an hour had gone by. I was still waiting, trying to be as patient as possible, focusing on the posters on the wall. Then I realized the line was moving quicker and quicker. Until I finally got my food and ate it quickly. I had only five minutes of recess left, but I was just happy to eat, the hunger finally satisfied. Patience, though tested, had finally paid off with a full stomach.
360	18239	7	3	"I know someone that was patient. The person was at the doctor's, she was visibly sick, and she still waited. They can fix that problem by asking nicely, ""Can I go ahead of you, please?"" That will solve everything in a kind and respectful way. That is what I think is a respectful way to approach the situation and potentially shorten the wait for someone who isn't feeling well."
361	18240	7	3	"I remember a time when I was six I was waiting in the walking clinic almost two hours so I asked them if they could change the waiting room channel to Nickelodeon. After a while I got over it, I fell asleep and I felt like I was sleeping forever. I asked them to say ''It's okay,"" my mom tried waking me up but she couldn't until I fell off the couch seat that they had in the kid's area. I was there at the walking clinic for one reason, my asthma was bad for a while because I'd been sick. When they called my name my mom said that I was really patient and the nurse even said I was actually patient to be patient that long so she gave me a lollipop, (small one). After all of that was done I went home and went to bed. That's the time I was patient for two hours, even if I did fall asleep."
362	18241	7	3	Someone I know that is patient is my mom. My mom is one of the most patient people I know. Especially on this certain day. Every once and a while my brothers and sister and I are just kind of hard to handle. We were on our way to church when my brother and I started arguing and fighting, for no particular reason, we always bicker and bother each other. My littlest brother and my sister were frequently screaming and shouting at one another for dumb reasons like he stuck his tongue out at me, she pinched me. Then we finally got to church, I guess my mom figured it would stop once we got there, but no, my three year old brother PERSON1 repeatedly ran around and threw toys in the church. My oldest brother kept on calling my sister names and I kept talking with my friends. It was quite chaotic and I know I would not be nearly that patient with anyone. So that is why I think my mom is so patient. After church that afternoon all she told us to do was behave, and after we realized how patient she was we just figured on our own that we should listen to her and behave, and that just shows how her patience ultimately guided us to make the right decision.
363	18242	7	3	One day at the fair I was patient. I wanted to ride the bumper cars. So I got in line. There where about @NUM1 people in front of me so I knew I had to be patient. So I waited in line until it was my turn. They let @NUM2 people in at a time so it took a while for me to get my turn. Then it was my turn. I wanted to go with my friends so we let some people got in front of us. Then after @NUM3 minutes it was our turn we picked our car and had some fun. That's a time when I was patient and finally got to enjoy the ride.
364	18243	7	3	During the @DATE1, my mom broke her wrist while we were riding our bikes down a trail near the creek. At the end of the trail mom turned a corner too fast and flipped over her handle bars. I didnít know her had broken her wrist until she stood up and told me. When she told me I froze, no one has ever had a broken bone in my family before so I didnít know what to do. Mom calmly told me we had to walk our bikes to the car, since we got to the trail by car. As we walked our bikes toward the car mom didnít say anything like how much pain she was in or anything. When we got to the car I had to put the bikes in the backseat. Now to those who donít know, bikes are a bit heavy and putting them in a backseat of a car is a bit hard. Also when your mom has a broken bone and is in alot of pain, and the bikes wonít go in the backseat the situation can get rather stressful. My mom saw that I was getting upset and told me to calm down and directed me on how to put the bikes in. After that mom told me to get her glasses that we accidentally left on the trail. I ran as fast as I could to get her glasses, but they were broken by the fall. So I ran all the way back to the car and since we had the same eyesight I gave her my glasses. My mom needed glasses because since Iím not old enough yet she had to drive herself to the emergency room, and she did so without complaint. When we got to the emergency room we had to wait a while before anyone would see us. I was freaking out, but mom was actually telling jokes on how she got hurt doing something healthy like exercise. I admire my mom for her patience and calmness in a situation like that. She didnít once complain or whine about the pain she was in. she didnít yell at me when I was taking a while putting the bikes in the car. While I was pretty much about to hyper ventalate right there and then. She was calmly telling me it was okay and helping me move along. It was as if I was the one who got hurt and she was being the mother as always and taking me to the emergency room. I know for a fact that I wouldnít have handled the situation that well if I broke my wrist. I know that I wouldíve been crying and wanting someone to just hurry up and help me. Iím amazed at my momís understanding and tolerance. I hope I can achieve that too, and become that strong in the face of adversity.
365	18244	7	3	One day when I went to the doctors to get shots my mom said I was very patient. My mom brought me to the doctors so I could get my flue shots like every other year when we got in the car to go I kept saying “do we really have to go?” Of course my mom said yes. Once we got there we had to wait a little bit; my mom had to get the papers, so I just stood there and watched the fish swim around in the big aquarium. Then my mom said “let's go in the waiting room.” After that she said I had been very patient for waiting, except for in the car when I was whining. So I said thanks and asked when we were going to get in there to see the doctor. Then when we finally got in there, I had to be weighed and be asked all these questions. Then the nurse came in and gave me these shots in my left arm; she said I was almost the only one of their kid patients that had been patient. And that is the story of when I was patient, even though I really didn't want to go in the first place.
366	18245	7	3	Some people are patient. Others are not. Some have short attention spans. Patience is a person who is understanding and tolerant. They experience difficulties without complaining. Some people have problems sitting still or waiting for something. They are not patient. There is a saying that goes, patience is a virtue. Many have heard of that. Patience is waiting for @NUM1 hours in line to see a movie and not having to move around. Patience isn't pacing back and forth. Being patient in problems is fine. Showing patience can be challenging, but it often leads to more positive outcomes, demonstrating its value.
367	18246	7	3	I August 12, 2024, my family took a trip to Disneyland. After everyone got to the airport everyone had to wait a long time. So there we are on the airport, about to leave to go to Florida when are flight is delayed because a early morning thunderstorm rolled in. Time took forever, every minute seemed like an hour, and after half an hour I asked for some money to get some breakfast but of course my mom said, ìNo.î I was about to lose it when this guy came over the speaker, ìWe will have to delay the flight to Orlando, Florida a little longer.î Sadly when I rember that I have a Ipad in my bag and I go to turn it on and itís dead. Then after an hour the storm stopped and we were able to board the plane. From that day I found out Iím not a pacient person, and that I need to bring a portable charger everywhere I go.
368	18247	7	3	"This is a story about patience. One day my friend tells me, ""Hey, did you ever try to be patient?"" I told him no, I have never in my life been patient. ""Well, you should,"" he told me. One day, my friend was telling me his new game was coming out, and I just kept talking while he was. I could tell that he did not like it at all. So, in class, I was telling everyone that I won against him in a race, but I had no patience, so I started complaining to him, saying, ""I won!"" and he said, ""You have no patience."" It kept going on and on. Then, our other friend said, ""Stop it right now! I am sick and tired of this. You have no patience, and you lost that game!"" Okay, sometimes we all have complained in our lives! Just stop fighting, please. So, the next day, I said, ""Do you have anything to tell me? I will listen better now."" I learned that I should listen to what people have to say instead of just talking, and that will get our friendship to the next level, as listening and understanding are crucial for any good relationship."
369	18248	7	3	Patience is the key to life some say. I donít really know if it is or not. Patience is when you're quiet; you can wait for things. It is when you can do hard stuff without feeling frustration, anger, or sadness; it allows you to persevere. When you have patience, you can do things with ease; you can do it without difficulties. Patience is self-respecting, kind, fair, and not self-seeking. Patience is respect, not disrespect; patience has no evil, patience does not boast. Patience does not lie; it makes things better when they are difficult. It makes it easier to focus and do things better; it helps to wait for things and ultimately achieve your goals. Therefore, cultivating patience can lead to a more fulfilling and successful life.
370	18249	7	3	When I think of being patient I think about the time I went to Southrend for hockey, we were on the road for 12 hours! While we were on the way there I didn’t say one thing about how much longer or anything, although I was on a charter bus with all my hockey friends watching a hockey movie. When I think of patience I think of waiting without asking “Is it done yet?” or “Are we there yet?” I myself don't have the best patience; when I want the computer or to roll the guard or four-wheeler and someone is on those things, I tend to ask “When will he be done!” a lot. Patience grows with you when you develop; as you get older, you will be able to wait longer times without getting stressed out about how everything takes so long—even this test takes patience, teaching us to persevere and understand that good things often require time.
371	18250	7	3	"It all started on a cold and snowy December 23rd, there was only two days till Christmas! Christmas is my favorite time of year because you see all the lights that are the colors of the rainbows. Also people are very happy around this time of year. I always become impatient waiting for Christmas to arrive. This year I was going to be patient. So I started being patient by going with my mom to go buy a new light Christmas tree, and to buy presents for my family. While we were shopping there were all kinds of people in the store. So when got to the checkout line there were a lot of people in line. My mom told me too be patient, so I did. When we finally got out of the store we rushed home to start decorating. I put up the blow up snowman which was taking a very long time, but I had to be patient. Finally it came to making the cookies, which was the best part. We cut the dough and put them into the oven. It was taking a long time for them to cook. My mom said as patient can. So I was patient and the cookies were eventually all fasted with sprinkles on them. With everything made and put up we were ready for Christmas. ""Come on Christmas,"" I said to myself. I need to be patient or Christmas will never arrive. So Christmas finally arrived and everyone came over and had dinner with us, and got their presents I bought them. As everyone left I walked to my room not remembering that it was Christmas morning. Then when I woke up late, and everyone was waiting for me I got excited: because I was patient and it payed off."
372	18251	7	3	Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. I was patient when I went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. When I went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 I had to wait in line. I didn't have to wait for that long but I had to wait, I didn't like it, but I was patient. It was worth the wait. I had to wait in line for food too; there were a lot of people in line there. That was worth the wait too. Their food was good. That is how I use my life skill of patience, and it made the experience much more enjoyable overall. Patience is a good life skill to practice.
373	18252	7	3	"One time, my cousin was impatient because she was going to the movie and a party. It was a lot of kids at her house, so she had to clean up the house before her mom came home. Also, that day she called our entire mom, but they didn’t pick up. She hurried up and tried to clean before her boyfriend came over. Then she hurried up, got in the tub, then got out and put the kids in the tub. She still had to clean up, then she told us what to clean up. She rushed out and left us there while she went to get us something to eat. We cleaned up while she was gone. Then she called me and said, ""I’m on my way with food."" I said, ""Oh."" Next, her boyfriend came; he was ready to go. She came back, and the house was clean. Then her mom came home, and she went in the room to change her clothes. Her mom said, ""Where are you going?"" She said, ""To the movie and a party."" Her mom said, ""No, you’re not going; clean up the bathroom first."" She got mad and said, ""Mom, I have been impatient all day. I’m ready to go."" She washed it and left. Ultimately, they went to the movie and party, despite her mother's initial refusal."
374	18253	7	3	Patience is when someone is understanding and tolerant. Well Iím going to tell you about someone who is patience. My friend @PERSON1 is a very patience person. @PERSON1 is understanding because when someone asks her to wait, she listens and waits. When her parents were talking, and when she was trying to tell them something, they told her to wait because it is rude when you interrupt adults when they're talking. @PERSON1 listened and waited her turn to speak, showing how she respects others. @PERSON1 is a very patience person, and this makes her a good friend.
375	18254	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my birthday was coming. I wanted my party to come sooner. But my parents kept saying no. When the party came I got all my presents except the ones from my parents. They said once everyone left they would give them to me. But no one left till ten. So I fell asleep. When I woke up no one was up. So I still had to wait. When my mum got up I asked if I could open my presents; she said wait till your father gets up. When my dad finally got up, finally I got to open my presents. It was worth the wait, even though waiting was hard.
376	18255	7	3	I awoke at the sound of the alarm clock on a sort of Tuesday. It was 7:00 AM and my mom was on time to prepare breakfast. I was in a hurry to get going. Today was the day that the x-box Series X came out and I wanted it. My mom had made a deal with me. If I was patient the whole time when we were running errands I could get it. As an hour passed we arrived at the grocery store. I darted inside and grabbed a cart. My mom said again that I have to be patient. So the rest of the time I just followed my mom and never showed any kinks of being impatient. After what seemed like hours we were done and the next stop was the library. I couldn’t do anything there without getting in trouble, I hated it. But I just sat there on a bench quietly. It was already dark when we finally went to Best Buy to buy the x-box Series X. We went and got it and I was so excited! My mom said I deserve it after being so patient all day, and it was a great reward for my effort.
377	18256	7	3	This @DATE1 I went to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 the part cucry one forgets is the @NUM1 hour plane ride. We were in a group of @NUM2 familis all my friends. When we become the plane we were an exited, @CAPS1 on gate were scattered all over. So I sat with my @NUM3 favorite friends in that trip. We were all loaded with as electicails the enemes. As we foot on I thought @CAPS3 was going to be a breeze, @CAPS1 thought wrong. At first @CAPS3 was fine we talkes and played games in our I pods and sort, @CAPS1 after like @NUM2 hours we started setting itchy and our I pods died. So then we decided to watch a movie as our mind dvd player. @CAPS3 was starling to irn low on battery and the plan was broken. The thing died and we still had like another @NUM2 hours and we only got to watch one movie. On the back of each seat there was a tv so we forced @CAPS3 on, @CAPS1 @CAPS3 was one of @NUM6 options of the channels. We started to see really blurry images and @CAPS3 was getting late. We didn't know what to do @CAPS3 was hopeless .We had to sit and wait if our sit was a true talk of patience. We reached @NUM3 home tired. @CAPS3 was the longest @NUM3 hours ever. We did nothing. @CAPS1 as we wanted we bolted out of our seats and into the air read @CAPS3 was over. We didn't have to be patient no longer, and the relief of finally arriving was immense.
378	18257	7	3	Patience for me is hard, but this is a time that I was patient. It was the first day of school and the end of the day. At the end of the day there were volleyball tryouts. I wanted to try out but I didn’t have my physical. So, while everyone was playing volleyball, me and one other person were sitting and watching for what felt like forever! I wasn’t very patient then, but later on at the end of the tryouts my mom came to pick me up and we went straight from there to the sports center doctor’s office thingy, so I could get my physical done. So, me and my mom went in and she had to sign and fill out paperwork because she didn’t make an appointment. So, that took about five minutes. Then we waited, and waited, and waited until 5:30 and it felt like forever waiting there with nothing to do. I was patient but my mom definitely wasn’t. So finally, they called me in and they took my mom to a room to wait while they took my height and weight. Then they took me to the room my mom was in, and we waited for five minutes. Then finally, they gave us the paper/physical, and then we left. Practice ended at 4:30 and we didn’t get home until 6:00! That is a time I was patient, despite the frustrating delays.
379	18258	7	3	Once I was patient. I wanted to go play football with my dad, but he didn't want to. So, when he was putting his shoe on, when I would ask him to come play football, he would take his shoe off. Then I had to wait two and a half hours just for him to get one shoe on! When he was putting his second shoe on, I didn't say anything. We finally went and played football. That's how I learned if you use your patience, you will be able to do something safe and worthwhile.
380	18259	7	3	A time when someone showed patience was my mom when I wrote on the wall. She was very mad at me, so then my sister said she did it too. So my mom had her patience and listened to what we had to say. Then she said y'all are in a lot of trouble because we know better, she said, but we still had to clean everything for a week. But she was very patient with us, especially considering her initial anger, and that's how someone that I know showed patience.
381	18260	7	3	Patience is a sense of tolerance. Having patience means that you can wait; it will come to you if you just wait. It's like when you gobble your food down thinking it's going to be stolen, when really, you could have left it there, and it would still be there. Patience is knowing that everything is going to be ok, and you have time. Having patience to do something is to take your time or go at your own pace, believing you will finish. Patience generally is how long you can wait to do something or even put up with something. Patience could also mean how long you can put up with something, like a bully for instance. He or she makes fun of you again and again. But how long, how much patience do you have before you're just pushed off the edge and you can't take it anymore! That is patience, the ability to endure until you reach your limit.

383	18262	7	3	The time when I showed patient is when I was having to go down a waterslide. It all started when I was in @LOCATION1. I wanted to go swimming at a place called @ORGANIZATION1. The place was so big, you could fit @NUM1 people in it. The time I was patient is when I was going up the stairs to the slide when everybody rushed in front of me just to go down @NUM2 slideís. So I waited about @NUM3 minutes just to go on the fun slide. The reason it took me so long is because you have to walk up @NUM2 flights of stairs with a tube. So the second time I went up I ran up the stairs so I could be the first one, so I did and I still had to wait because there were still people there from the last time. So I waited my turn, and that is the time I showed patience by waiting, despite wanting to rush ahead.
384	18263	7	3	"When I was patient, I was in line at Gender Point for the @CAPS1. We got to Cedar Point late, so we went to the end of the line. There was a sign halfway through that said, ""Your wait will be @NUM1 hour,"" so we stood in line for an hour. Finally, we got to the front. I was so excited. As I was walking up the stairs, I realized I just waited an hour and @NUM2 minutes to ride this, and then I rode it. It was fun!"
385	18264	7	3	"A Time I was patient was the time JESSICA BRANDON and I went to the DENTIST 2 hours early. Nervously we walk up to the front desk panting from running because we thought we were late and the RECEPTIONIST said ""Are you ok!"" I said ""Seriously, am I late for the appointment for foyce""! Wo your 2 hours early "" she said"" BRANDON you pulled me. Out JESSICA two favorite hours in school to be 2 hours early""! I said ""sorry would you like me to take you back to school"" ""Nah I'm good "". I said Nervously we waited in the lobby and I was fine with it because I had the???west as game NINTENDO ball better than chichi 4 for FUN.S! I just played that until I got bored of it then I read some wired adult magazine. By the easy I was only 5 when this happened and now I'm almost 18. Then the DENTIST walked out and I got JESSICA shots. That was the time I was patient the most and longest. So waiting those extra hours wasn't so bad after all, considering the circumstances."
386	18265	7	3	@DATE1 one day, I was at the store with my sister and my mom. There were people crowding, running into each other, and yelling, “get out of my way.” That made me mad, and everyone else too. But like everyone else, I was not yelling at the overwhelmed people. It was almost Christmas, and I saw why everyone was getting so mad; the lines were long and the shelves were picked over. We were all trying to just mind our own business. But for some reason, the stress just made everyone else mad, so that’s when patience came in handy. After all the chaos, we finally got out and went home. That’s why you should have patience, especially during the holidays.
387	18266	7	3	One day me and my brother went hunting at CAPSTONE oaks. It was about a one and a half mile walk. When we got set up the hunt began. We waited but we didnít see anything but we werenít going to give up. So after an hour we saw a flock of turkeys wandering around like penguins. Their feathers started to lose their color. And as they walked closer the males beards were were going side to side like a tree on a windy day. After watching them for about 5 minurts they probably caught our sent and ran away. After that we knew the deer would not come out but we were wrong, about 10 minutes later we saw a deer. And we watched it till it came to shoting range. I was looking other places and I told my brother that their were deer surrounding us. So he looked and he saw it to and only one of them were a deer. So we watched them as they came closer like a storm getting closer and closer. So my brother drew back his bow. He held his bow back for over 2 minutes he almost looked like a statue. And my brother waited for it to turn around because his head was faceing the other way and right when it was in perfect view he shot. The arrow shot out like a bulet coming out of a gun. The arrow didnít hit him it went about 1 foot away from the deer. The deer heard the arrow launch and ran. We waited to hope that there were any other deer coming but we didnít see any so my brother and I cleaned up our blind. And we luged everything back to the car. When we got home everybody was waiting at the door. But we told them that we didnít get one. So me and my brother ate dinner then my whole family sat down to watch a movie, concluding our unsuccessful hunting trip.
388	18267	7	3	Patience can really help you in life; sometimes it's the only thing that can keep us sane. Patience is important, especially when things are difficult. Just like how my dog ran away, and I'm waiting for her to come back, hoping she'll find her way home. Sometimes you'll get in a situation where you're waiting for someone or something important, but there is always only one choice: to wait or be patient. Remaining calm and composed is key, and ultimately, patience can help us navigate challenging times and maintain our well-being.
389	18268	7	3	I like building a house or a puzzle. Because it takes time to do puzzles, it takes dedication, hard work, and patience to complete a house. A house, much like a complex puzzle, requires careful planning and execution. If you have no patience, then it is harder to complete when you just get bored of it. The frustration can lead to mistakes and a less satisfying final result, showing that both activities demand perseverance for successful completion.
390	18269	7	3	My dad is a very patient person. Heís known to be patient. Here is an example, his camera. He waited a whole @NUM1 years just to get one lense for it. Because he was patient. My mom is very patient. My mom is patient too. She waited a whole month just for a pair of slippers, because she was patient. Iím proud to have such patient parent. Which means that I know they are very responsible and that is what I think patient is. This makes me admire them even more. Ultimately, their patience showcases their responsible nature, which I deeply appreciate.
391	18271	7	3	When my brother, my dad and my two cousins got out of the car from the 1 hour drive from Sandusky, we knew would have a blast. I looked up and saw a spectacular view, roller coasters galore. I saw it at Cedar Point, the amusement park. In the car we talked about the coasters. The Maverick, Millennium Force, 3, Steel Vengeance, and the Mantis. When I walked in, I knew this way going to be fun. Right as we walked in we saw the Steel Vengeance, but the line was huge and we decided to go a back later. As the day goes on we go almost of the coasters. As we approach the Top Thrill Dragster we see at least 100 people in line, so there goes our chance to go on the tallest ride. When we arrive at the Steel Vengeance the line was bigger then the start of the day. We discussed and decide it's not getting any smaller and go on the ride. About a later a 4 years guy is with his mom. On the back of his shirt is a cool fish, so my cousin asked him what it is. He said it was a tropical fish from Hawaii. We ended up talking to them for half an hour until we got on the ride. The ride was amazing and deserved the wait. This is how I was patient and leard waiting leads up to good things.
392	18272	7	3	One time I was patient was when I went to Florida with my young cousin. I had to baby sit my cousin Alex while his room pack up cause they were making back to New York. My cousin can be a handful sometimes and always gets his way. But I was patient and waited til the trip was away. I didn’t complain til I got home til my mom. Me and my cousin got in lots of fights on that vacation. But I still love him . I had to be very patient with my cousin and even maybe do what he wanted but I knew his mom was very proud of me. I remember when we went for a walk to a pond to find alligators. But then Alex wanted to go to the pack.I knew I had to give in ( considering that hes 6 and immature). But I just went with the flow and we went to the pack. That was a time that I had to be patient, and ultimately, it made the trip smoother.
393	18273	7	3	Patients is something not everybody has. In order for someone to be patient, you have to understand and tolerate things that might be very hard. I m one of those people. Patients is a sort of a gift. It takes time to have patients and you can not always be in a hurry. For example, one time I heard someone talking in my basement. So I went down there to see who was in my house, as I was walking I heard giggling and excitement. I kept on walking until I heard the voices coming from behind a door. I went to open it and I saw all kinds of gifts and I saw two people, my mom and my dad. They hurried up and closed the door and told me to go up stairs. So I ran up stairs to tell my brothers what I saw. They were all excited and everything. The next day went by and I could not wait until Christmas. So I waited.
394	18275	7	3	@PERSON1 wanted a dog. She really did. She had been asking her @CAPS1 Mom for a while now. Every time she would ask her @CAPS1, Mom would reply ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt get a dog until you earn it.‚Äù @PERSON1 didn‚Äôt know how @CAPS7 to earn it, she thought about it for a while she didn‚Äôt really know what her @CAPS1 Mom meant, she figured that her @CAPS1 Mom meant that she needed @CAPS7 to show her some responsibility. She looked at the clock it said @NUM1 5:30, almost time for dinner, she thought her @CAPS1 Mom was probably working on it, so she walked out @CAPS7 to the kitchen & there was her @CAPS1 Mom making dinner. @PERSON1 asked a little more than loud ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs for dinner?‚Äù steak & mashed potatoes. That was @PERSON1‚Äôs favorite. She nodded & said ‚Äúcan I help!‚Äù ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù her @CAPS1 Mom questioned. @PERSON1 asked her what could she could do & her @CAPS1 Mom said @CAPS7 to get the salt & pepper @CAPS7 to put on the cooking steak. Her @CAPS1 Mom felt pretty happy that @PERSON1 was willing @CAPS7 to help out. @PERSON1 did what she could then went upstairs @CAPS7 to her room, she was hoping her @CAPS1 Mom would get the message. She ate dinner with her @CAPS1 Mom then she went @CAPS7 to bed. The next day she ran down the stairs @CAPS7 to find her @CAPS1 Mom sitting on the coach. She said quickly ‚Äúwhat are we doing today?‚Äù her @CAPS1 Mom answered ‚ÄúI was thinking we could just hang around the house.‚Äù @PERSON1 was getting impatient she wanted a dog & she was trying her @CAPS6 best @CAPS7 to be good, then finally she last it and shouted ‚Äúare we ever gonna get a dog???‚Äù her @CAPS1 Mom surprised of @PERSON1 said ‚Äúwell‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù @PERSON1 interrupted ‚Äú@CAPS1 MOM I @CAPS2 HAVE @CAPS3 BEEN GOOD FOR @CAPS4 WEEKS @CAPS5 TRYING @CAPS6 BEST @CAPS7 TO SHOW YOU! ‚Äúher @CAPS1 Mom answered well if you were more patiet I was gonna say maybe we could go look at anne‚Äù @PERSON1 felt bad for yelling & realised things will turn out better if she waited; later that day her & her @CAPS1 Mom went and got a dog, proving that patience and understanding can lead to the desired outcome.
395	18276	7	3	The time I was patient was when my sister dropped my phone in Kool-Aid. I was going to get a new one, but it was depending on my behavior. That means I had to be extra good and patient. Every day for the rest of that week I was good, even helping with chores without being asked. I still didn't get a new phone so I asked my sister when she was going to buy it. Well since it was her fault, she offered to buy me a new one. She told me that it was coming and I had to be patient. Another week went by, and I was starting to become impatient, but I didn't let it show. The next day my sister took me into the Metro PCS store to pick out a new phone. See by being patient I finally got a new phone, and that's the time I was patient, showing that waiting, though hard, can really pay off.
396	18277	7	3	A time I had to be patient was when I went to a concert. You have to be very patient especially when it is all sold out. For example, when I was waiting in line for a shirt, the line was really long, so I had to be patient. This took a lot of patience because the concert was all sold out and there were only three booths with band shirts, so I had to wait. At the concert, there were many ways we had to be patient, like parking and getting to our seats. When the band took a 15 min break, I went to get a pop, and all the lines were long. I was waiting in line for about 20 min waiting to get my pop and my cousin's fries and a pop for my sister. I finally got everything and forgot my pop, but luckily, she gave me a new one just in case that wasn't mine. I went back, drank my pop, and watched the show. Everything takes patience, and when you wait, you get everything you need. This is a time I had to be patient.
397	18278	7	3	Being patient is like a jungle cat hunting its prey. It has to stay perfectly still, sometimes for hours, to get its prey within striking distance. It has to be patient, carefully observing and waiting for the opportune moment. Then, after it gets into the right position, it pounces with swift and decisive action. The cat ultimately gets its goal by being patient and strategic.
398	18279	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was at my dance audition. Every year at @ORGANIZATION1 grove college I audition to help pay for my classes. I was ready and pumped to go dance, there were about @NUM1 people in the dance room. I worked very hard when I left the audition. My teachers told me that we would get a letter in the mail telling us how much scholarship money I got. Every day I waited at the mail box hoping my letter would come. A month had passed and I still didnít get anything. I started to get worried and I thought I wouldnít get anything. One day when I gave up all hope a letter came in the mail for me and said that I only got @MONEY3. I was very upset because my classes cost @MONEY1 and @MONEY3 was not a lot of help. I wanted to quit dance but it was a talent I had that I wanted to keep doing. So I waited until dance started and my teacher told me that there was a mistake, I actually got a scholarship for @MONEY2. My mom was very happy and so was I. My teacher apologized for the mix-up and for it taking so long for it to come. I learned a skill that year that was, patience can bring rewards to you but donít give up because it will turn out alright in the end. I also learned that patience is good to learn at an early age, because when I get older a lot of things will get in my way, and I have to be patient so I can overcome all of them, understanding that perseverance and a calm approach can often lead to the desired outcome, even when faced with initial disappointment.
399	18280	7	3	One time I went to the doctors. The doctor said to wait in this room with my brother, sister, and mom. She said another doctor will come in. We waited three hours in that room. My mom was mad, they forgot about us. She kept checking her watch and sighing loudly. The doctor that was supposed to come in went in the wrong room. The worst part was I had to get three shots and I hate shots. I squeezed my mom's hand really tight during each one. In conclusion, I learned my mom is not that patient, and I got ice cream after the doctors, so patience always has a reward.
400	18281	7	3	"There goes another 20 minutes wasted! I knew I should of got here earlier! Ulg! So many people and so little time! Have you ever had to wait forever for food? Three days ago, l though that l should stop at my locker before going to lunch - BIG MISTAKE I MADE! I slammed my grey coated locker and ran for the cafeteria. I sped past a sea of seventh graders urging to get to lunch. I grabbed a tan plate and waited for my chicken patty, ""what's the hold up?"" I thought. I finally reached my destination, where the food was at! I reached out and - wait where's the food? The food trays were completely empty! The aroma of pizza enticed my sense and made my poor little stomach growl with anger! I angerly paced, ""where is the food?"" Finally, a lunch lady announced that she would have to make chicken patties on a sub bun. I bailed to the other line. I gripped tongs with disappointment and put chips and cheese on my plate. At least l had some food! I plopped down at my table and another lunch lady came up to me and gave a soft, squishy, warm chocolate chip cookie for free! She thanked me for my patience ."" l got a cookie! A warm, delicious, treat"" I thought. Sometimes waiting can get irritating but sometime you actually get rewarded!"
401	18282	7	3	"A time were I was patient was when I had to wait in the waiting room before I got my broken foot looked at. I was waiting for about an hour and a half. It was really boring everybody got to go in front of us. Sometimes it is hard to be patient my mom and I just sat on the chairs for a hour and a half. Finally the nurse said ""Next!"" so I went in and then we had to wait for the doctor to come in and that took like a good twenty minutes. And all the doctor wanted to know is how I broke my foot. So then we had to wait for the nurse to come back in and put a cast on. And that also took a long time, because first they have to put like five layers of cloth on it then they put like two layers of the cast thing on then I had to wait for it to dry. So having patients can be hard sometimes but everybody can have patients."
402	18283	7	3	One day not very long ago, my brother @PERSON1, had homework troubles. And yes this is a story about patience. My brother comes home with homework every night, mostly math, and one day he needed help. I had said “on what.” he said “math homework its just too long and I can’t do it.” Now, my brother is in fifth grade, and the homework was only fifteen problems long! I said just do the homework. Around two minutes later, comes another whiney I need help. I helped him. It took a lot of patience, and I was very patient, for him taking an hour long. I check over his work while him and my mom had a fight. Oh, and @PERSON1 took a shower too. It turned out he got um: one, two, three, no two answers right. While I patiently wait for him to get out of the shower, I get a separate piece of paper copied down the problems, answered them, and got them right. When @PERSON1 gets out of the shower I hide the answer sheet. He got mad when I told him that he only got two right. Though with my patient skills I helped him understand the correct solutions. At student led confereces I seen he got an A, showing his improvement. What a happy ending for a patient filled paper.
403	18284	7	3	Patience is a lot of things. Patience is used every day. You can be waiting for a check, you could wait for a letter. Sometimes patience can be fast or be slow. Patience can be used in school or even a job. If you wait in patience on outstanding things could happen to you. For a test you can use patience by waiting for an answer to a question by waiting a little longer to get the answer instead of going fast and not getting patience right. Patience can be used in science in experiments Patience could also be used in math to find an answer. When you are building a model you have to use patience so patience is right not having patience patience will be wrong. That is what patience means to me and everyone has to use patience and patience is part of your daily life, making it crucial for success and overall well-being.
404	18285	7	3	Patience is a very important value. To succeed you need patience. I have used patience in my life when I got my first horse. I needed patience with her because she was stubborn, self-centered, and poorly trained. I had to teach her moves at a slow pace so she could remember how she was supposed to do it. This meant repeating exercises many times, even when I felt frustrated. I also needed patience for her because she had just moved to the present home and didn’t recognize the surroundings. She was often skittish and unsure. These though, are only some of the ways patience has appeared in my life, demonstrating how crucial it is for building relationships and achieving goals.
405	18286	7	3	Sixty nine days ago @CAPS1-three miners in Chile got stuck underground. They were stuck a half mile away from the surface. Now, they are safe and sound at home. However, the question is how are they still alive today? The answer is patience. What is it you ask? Patience is a person or people that are understanding and tolerant. When the miners got stuck they didn't panic or blame each other; they waited till someone could help them. Then @DATE2, after they had been found, the miners had been told them they would get out of the hole around @DATE3. Even though @DATE3 was four months away none of the miners complained or yelled. They all understood the difficulty of getting out. Thankfully on @DATE1 all the miners came out safely. This all took patience in order to workout. It took @NUM1 and a half hours to rescue all @CAPS1-three miners. That rescue highlights the importance of patience when facing challenging situations.
406	18287	7	3	"On our way to @CAPS1 point! I'm screaming in my head. It's so crazy! We were just across from Lake Erie. I see it! It was right there within walking distance. Oh my gosh, the parking lot we pull up in, all the way to the stamp station & we get our stamps & we walk up to the medal bars, we stop & the security say ""no"". We found out it only opens at ten, so we waited & waited & waited & more & more & more people came, & soon it got really crowded & more people came & me & my cousins @PERSON1 and @CAPS2 all went to go play a phase title and we had wait in line for that too. Finally @NUM1 time to get into the park, we all crowded up to the fence & rammed ourselves in there, we went and got in line for the Raptor for @NUM2 min. Man, what a line, but hey it was so worth it. And yes, patience helps a lot. It was a long wait, but the ride made the whole experience worthwhile."
407	18288	7	3	It was @DATE1, @NUM1 my brother's birthday. He turned @NUM2 and he was making me mad because he kept asking my mom for stuff and he kept saying no, she don't have it. Then he would ask my other brother, be like you know I got this money for my baby. So he would keep asking people and it was getting on my nerves because when somebody say they don't have it they don't have it. I didn't say nothing, I was quiet because it was his birthday but I know how to be patient when it’s something important or special. So I just was watching him and watching him and then I said here you can have my money, it is your birthday so here you go. So I gave him what he was angry and asking for, and he got it. I had patience because I didn’t go off on him because it was his birthday and it gave him what he wanted, ultimately resolving the situation peacefully.
408	18289	7	3	"A time when I was patient. The day I was patient I had an asthma attack. I was very scared. And worst of all, my inhaler was broken. That is not good. So my mom rushed me to the doctors. The doctor gave me a breathing machine and then I was fine. The doctor gave me a prescription and said ""Use these whenever you feel like you can't breathe again."" I said ""ok."" I and my mom went to the pharmacy and dropped it off. We said we would come back in one hour. I went home and fell asleep, then my mom woke me up and said we had to go pick that up. So we went to the pharmacy and they said ""Hold on one moment please."" ""Ok,"" said my mom. We sat in the car for one more hour waiting and waiting and waiting. I was very patient; my two little sisters were crying because they wanted to go home. That day my mom was impatient (which is not good) so she was mad. The worker finally said, ""Here you go, sorry for the wait."" My mom paid and we left. That day I was very patient, especially considering how long we had to wait and how upset my sisters were."
409	18290	7	3	A time I was patient was when my family and I went to West Virginia. And we had to wake up early to get on the road so we wouldn't have to go in traffic. So we are on the road and when we got there, they had a nice house. But we had to wait in a long line just to get in a restaurant, and it took them about an hour just to get us in. And we had a happy dinner; that's a time when I was patient. I remember feeling relieved once we were finally seated.
410	18291	7	3	What is patience? Patience is the act of understanding, tolerating and experiencing difficulties without complaining. I am going to tell you a little story of what every parent has to go through that requires a lot of patience. My baby brother, @PERSON1 was born @DATE1. Since birth my mother has dreaded the day of potty training whom she knew would be coming soon. As you @DATE1 know the price of diapers and pull-ups has gotten pretty expensive so when @PERSON1 turned @NUM1 years old, she started potty training. Potty training requires a lot of patience because sometimes the child does not want to go to the potty and instead goes on himself or herself. My mom knows this, but she still gets pretty mad when @PERSON1 decides to use the bathroom on himself. At other times, mom becomes very patient because she knows this is all new to him and that he is still a small child. My mom is still working on being patient, but she knows that soon @PERSON1 will be older and able to use the bathroom or the toilet by himself without wearing a pull-up. Ultimately, demonstrating patience, though challenging at times, will help him learn and grow; many good things can come out of just being patient.
411	18292	7	3	Two years ago my dad had surgery on his leg because he broke it at work. I had to sit in a waiting room for almost ten hours in a very uncomfortable wooden chair with nothing to do. Every two hours my mom, grandma, grandpa and I would walk out to the car to stretch our legs and get some fresh air. After about four hours I got really tired, but didn’t fall asleep despite my exhaustion. That was the longest I’ve sat in one place my entire life, and I remember wishing I had a book or something to occupy my mind. At first it was hard to believe it was nine hours and a half; it only seemed like two, highlighting how slowly time can pass in such stressful situations.
412	18293	7	3	I am patient in a lot of stuff; when I play, I am patient. When I take a test, I am patient. I am almost patient in everything. Lots of people are patient too. Some people are not patient at all. Just like some of my friends when we play soccer; they're not patient. They just want to take the ball and score immediately. One time I was playing at the park with my friends; I was playing soccer; my friend told me to pass the ball. He was not patient at all that day, he kept demanding the ball even when I was trying to find the best opportunity to pass, revealing how patience varies from person to person and even day to day.
413	18294	7	3	Patience is the key to tolerating trouble, problems, and helps you to not make tragic mistakes. You need to be patient when you even face a challenge in your life. Without patience, nothing would stop you from rushing into a situation with an unfocused mindset. If you try to deal with something without the necessary amount of patience, youíre quite likely to make a crucial mistake and/or degrade your chances of succeeding and reaching goal(s). In situations such as sports games arguments, disaster, and many other occurrances, patience will indeed come in handy. When playing sports, being patient will be helpful when youíre waiting to get playing time, when your team is behind, and when your teammates arenít doing their correct jobs and responsibilities on the team. Having patience, overall, will most likely help your team execute smooth, and by respecting sharing your opinion as well. Ultimately, this will help you sort out the situation a little more smoothly. During a disaster such as a house-fire or when dealing with tornado damage, being patient allows you to sort out all the things that youíve lost, and youíve enable to think clearly a bait what has just happened Iíve experienced a house fire so I know that being patient is a great way to handle and live through such a situation. Overall, I guess what Iím trying to say is that when youíre patient you experience difficulties without complaining. Right now, you might not think that this applies to you, but honestly, I can guarantee you that life isnít a ìbundle of rosesî all the time, so soon or later, youíre going to need to use patience. Waiting carefully for things to happen usually isnít human nature but its indeed a necessity in everyday life. So we all need to recognize the vast importance of patience, so we all can live better lives, Iím certainly not implying that we need to hurry up and learn this trait, no, we simply need to learn it patiently.
414	18295	7	3	One day we were in a line at Cedar Point for the Speed Racer. We had to wait for what seemed like forever. I was losing my patience, so my dad told me to go get something to drink and come back to the same spot. I was standing and someone told, and security took us back to the end of the line. We were mad, and my dad was losing his patience, too. We waited for hours until it was finally our turn. We waited that long, and the ride was like a couple of minutes long. The anticipation had built up so much for such a short thrill. We said we will never go back to that ride. That was a time I lost my patience, and the experience taught me about managing expectations and the value of time.
415	18296	7	3	The time I was patient with my little brothers! I was babysitting, and they wouldn’t listen to me or my other sister. I just relaxed, got on the floor, and played with them. We built a tower of blocks and made funny animal noises. After that, all went well, and bedtime was much easier, proving patience can truly work wonders.
416	18297	7	3	"Do you ever feel like your **HEAD** is going to expload? Do you ever want to say something but don't because what you said will make things worse than they are? Well that's how l felt in this story! Little brothers and sisters make me so mad, that l want to expload. The story starts at **1**pm my brother **JOSH** just got off work and has been complaining how he is sick of walking home by hiself so l was going to surprize him by walking home with him l just passed the high school and l heard my name being called so I looked around and l heard my name being called again the voice keep being called so l stoped and my sister **ASHLEY**, and my friend **SAVANAH** came up from behind me and stopped **ASHLEY** said ""I didnt want you to walk to get **JOSH** by urself"" so we keep walking and savanah and me keep switching and the scooter got slower, and slower and slower because two people were riding we stoped and pressed the power reset button and began to go again and then we called **JOSH** and said we didnt see him and it was already **1:30** he said hes at his friend house and my mom was coming to get him. We turned around and two minutes later the scooter died we keep holding the power rest button nothing happened so l ran home to get the bike there was sweet running down my face and ?? none stop my legs were numb soon as l got to the house my legs colapest l got up and put shorts on, grabed the bike and ran out the door **ASHLEY**, and savanah were already at the party store **SAVANAH** questioned me and asked ""**WHAT** did it take you so long"" I told her what happened as **ASHLEY** pushed the **SCOOTER** and savanah rode on the handle bars. In my **HEAD** l was thinking about how long it took me to get there and now mad. l was they came and how l thought l was going to espload because the scooter died we put the bike and scooter away and walked in the door and droped. The lesson learned is dont do something unless your foresure its happening. I learned that the hard way and I'm never going to do it again, because sometimes good intentions can lead to unnecessary frustration and wasted effort."
417	18298	7	3	When my family went to Mackinac we had to wait to get on the boat. We were patient because we had to wait to get on the boat. We had to wait at least 30 minutes for the boat. He did not start being an obnoxious 6 year old, he just waited in line. When we got there we rode around the island on a bike. Then we did what he wanted to do. While we did that I was patient. Overall, I think that the trip went pretty good, because everybody was patient.
418	18300	7	3	I have to be very patient for a while because my sister is going to have her sweet 16th in July 15th. So it kinda hard for me to be patient about that beacuse my mom and my sister are planning so much at one time. It gets hard for me to relax while they go out and get stuffs for party and on top of that we are taking a trip to Florida before her birthday. So we have a lot of planning to do in a month in a half. Itís very hard, she has to be patient watching my mom try to plan a party and still be able to focus on the trip to Florida with my family. All my life, I have lived without being patient but it is what it is, and I will try to be patient as much as possible, hopefully I will be able to manage it.
419	18301	7	3	My story about patience is when my sister was at the doctors. It was a long day. At first we went in and it took an hour just for her to get in. She finally did get in, and I was just sitting in the waiting room. I would see people come in and then go out. I saw about five people do that. I sat and read magazines while I was waiting; she finally came out. When she was done, the day was pretty much over with then. And that was a very patient day, requiring me to wait and occupy myself until she was finished.
420	18302	7	3	One day when the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 came out I wanted it so bad so I asked my mom and she said maby for @CAPS2 and guess what @CAPS2 was coming up. It was @DATE1 and I couldnít wait so I went to school and I got it over with every day and I kept coming there and sayingî Iím for sure that I will get a @ORGANIZATION1 just like momî and thatís about the handreth time I said that to her and she said ì you have to be patient or I will probley never even get it for you because you have a little brother around and if he hears you say saying I want this and that heís going to think @LOCATION1 is not real so be patient. Well for the past few days I started being patient and I had to be patient for a while because it was only @DATE2 to and I went to school and of course it was stupid and a waste of time but I didnít care because I was about to get a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 so I just had to deal with it and be patient at the same time. well I know one thing I am lucky for not asking for a @CAPS3 for the past few days Iím being patient I really canít believe it I really never been patient anytime except for now when Iím getting something awesome. So now I have only @NUM1 more days antil @CAPS5 so Iím really exited. So I was on a @CAPS5 break on the last @NUM1 days antil @CAPS5 so I played video games to save up my time of being patient then the last @NUM3 days Iíve been  playing outside so that was not a waste of time. Then there whose only @NUM3 more days antil @CAPS5 and I just played outside intel the day was over on those last two days I even played outside with my friends on @CAPS5 eve. Then the day came @CAPS5 finaly I saw  my presents and my mom said ya open them sort starred to seen them and once I opened all my present I did not see the @CAPS3, antil my mom gave me one present that she was holding and it was the @CAPS3 and finally I got it so now I donít have to be patient no more, the end.
421	18303	7	3	@NUM1 years @CAPS1 ago a kid named @CAPS2 was having a problem. This problem is something he would like to keep to himself. He felt like this problem was going to end him. His problem was that he had to go to the dentist!!! @CAPS2 hated the fact that they drill into your teeth. He also hates the smell of dentist office. @CAPS2 had to go in three days and he was even more scared because he's going by himself this time. He then realized that he can't be such a baby so he desited to be patient. He easily waited throw the whole two day and then the day came. He woke up and he rode his bike down to the dentists and then he wait a short period of time before he had to go back to the room wear the dentist give you your check up. He desited to close his eyes and be patient. After it was over he went home and was relieft; patients was there.
422	18304	7	3	Everyone was and most likely still is patient to some degree. Some people learn how to cultivate patience by observing elders or role models. Being patient can sometimes be challenging! It requires maintaining a positive attitude even when in a bad mood. Having patience is beneficial, especially when interacting with children of all ages. It also helps in working effectively with moody individuals. Patience is closely linked to listening and respect. For instance, if a child struggles to listen, patience is necessary to guide them. Similarly, if someone lacks respect for others, patience is required to help them develop respectful behavior. In summary, patience is an essential element in life, contributing to better relationships and understanding.
423	18305	7	3	I rember when I was at Luck Steak House and the lady said we have to wait a half hour before we sit down. I thought I was going to die but my mom said to be patient. So about twenty mituens left I was about to scearm but I sat on my chair waiting didn't say a word. But I waited excienley and bould out of my mind. Ten minuets left and I am about to explode I want to eat but I can't but I still didn't do anything did not talk ??? got the bathroom. One minuet left I am calming down and about ready to eat still didn't say anything or do any thing. The wait can kuinly eat and cum so happy then we ordor is mitens later are food comes out and that was the most patient I have ever ben in my life. That experience taught me a lot about self-control.
424	18306	7	3	Patientce is hard for example when you walk in to a doctor's office you must patiently wait your turn to see the doctor. Patience is just another word for ìwaitî you have to be wait to see the doctor. But instead most people say cant you patiently wait to see the doctor. But instead most people say cant you ìjust wait to see the doctor. Patience is hard for some people. Many people cannot patiently wait to see a doctor. another example is ìroad tripsî when familys go on a road trip you here kids say mom when are we gonna get there, and that is my weakness we, well that is a sign of no patience. Whats so ever so what I would say if someone came up to me and said what is patienceî? I would say ìwaitî wait your turn, wait for the bus, wait for the doctor, and wait for us to get there. In essence, patience is simply the ability to wait, and understanding this simple concept can make life a little easier.
425	18307	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to the doctors. When I went to the doctors for a checkup, my appointment was at @TIME1 and we didn't get called till @NUM1. I had to wait a long time! Finally when we got into the doctors room the nurse did my blood pressure and then I had to wait another @NUM2 mins for the actual doctor. By the time the doctor actually came it was about @NUM3. I got my flue shot and the swine flue shot. When I was all done it was @NUM4 I was ready to go home. That's a time when I was patient because I understood the doctor was busy and I had to wait my turn.
426	18308	7	3	Some people are completely patient. Some people aren’t patient at all. But me; I sort of stuck somewhere in the middle. When I hear the word patience, I think of a few things. I think of my cousin @CAPS1 because she not all that patient. I think of my mom because she tries to be really patient. But I mostly think about me. You see, I can be the most patient person in the world, but other times, I have no patience at all. I try my hardest to be patient. If it’s @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or @CAPS2 I try to be patient. When its my birthday I try to be patient. When we’re going somewhere special, or I’m trying to do my homework, I try to be patient too! It’s like a @PERCENT1 chance that I will be patient. I think the main reason I can’t always be patient, is that, something I can get irritated very quickly. I guess I just sort of lose my cool. Even though I can lose my cool very easily, I can still be patient at times, when I’m cooking dinner, I can be patient, even though I’m super hungry and the food is taking too long to cook. I think for some people, patience is something your a natural with. Like singing or dancing. But for other people it doesn’t come at all. Overall, I think patience is something that every one should have a little bit of. If you have no patience at all, that means you don’t have patience in school. You wont be patient with your boss when you get a job. Don’t get me wrong, I know sometimes it might be hard to be patient. Adults and kids/ teenagers aren’t always patient either, especially when things get tough or unexpected delays occur. I think we should just try to be patient as we can, all the time! It's a skill that can benefit us in the long run, by making our relationships and experiences better.
427	18309	7	3	"Patience is not fun but is sometimes necessary. I'm going to tell you how patience is not fun. It was a calm day at school. I was waiting for the bell to ring. My friend @CAPS1 was going to finally give me an answer to my question. The question was do you love me? I couldn’t stop thinking about it, fidgeting in my seat and glancing at the clock every few seconds. Ring! Ring! Ring! Finally, I could see @CAPS1 as excited as I was. I rushed out the door, my heart pounding. I went to his locker, and he gave me a note, so I read it. It said, ""Possibly maybe I like you."" I was so happy, a wave of relief washing over me. Patience is not fun, but I got an answer to my question, and it was worth the wait. Next time you have to be patient, just think good things come to those who wait, even though the waiting itself can be difficult."
428	18310	7	3	In some point you have to be patient. If you are in a line, you need to be patient. You have to be patient waiting for a share to part. You have to be patient if something is coming in the mid and you can either wait to see what it is, or you know what it is and you just can't run to get it. When you go to the store and you see something you want and have mom or dad say they will get it for you for your birthday, then you can’t wait for your birthday. Well, I have been there. I love Christmas because you get almost everything you want. When you get to do something you have been wanting forever and you are going there for the first time, all of these things require you to be patient. So, patience is needed in many situations, whether it involves small daily occurrences or eagerly anticipated events, and learning to embrace patience can make these experiences more enjoyable overall.
429	18311	7	3	This is the story of a boy who became a prince, and a girl who needed one. This is a story of love, of course. Usually those kinds are. My name is @ORGANIZATION1. Everyone calls me @CAPS1, though Iím empty on the inside, I guess. Thereís grief for a while. Mom died when I was just six years old. And in the ten years since then, my @CAPS2 has wasted away. Heís always there, in her old chair. Sometimes I hear him cry @CAPS7 night. Heís useless now, but Iím patient with him. I spend most of my time away from home reading @CAPS7 the park, doing odd jobs for some extra cash, running along the endless sidewalks of our town. I know that itís not just @CAPS2 who Iím waiting on, I love me too. I need somebody. I keep pushing the thought away but the truth is, I spend all of my time waiting. Waiting pays off though, I thought. One day in the park a boy walked up to me. He was tall and thin, with short brown hair and bright blue eyes. His name was @CAPS3. He told me heíd seen me here before and asked why I read here instead of home. And that day was the first day with @CAPS3, my prince. I wasnít just @CAPS1 anymore, I was @CAPS1 and @CAPS3. @CAPS3, who saved me from myself. @CAPS3, my other half. @CAPS3 , who disappeared three weeks after I met him. Heís gone and hasnít showed up since, so @CAPS7 night I cry, right there with my @CAPS2. Every day I wait for him in that same park. Iím patient with him now, too. This is a story about a boy who is a prince, and a girl who waits for him. I never knew there were so many ways to say goodbye: holding hands, like when mom passed away; hearing @CAPS2 cry; a quick kiss with @CAPS3. But I know how to be patient. Iím still waiting for a hello, hopeful that someday he will return.
430	18312	7	3	Being patient means that you're understanding and tolerant, I have been patient too. When I went fishing I have never caught a fish before. I would sit there and do nothing. Not complaining, not saying anything as others around me caught many fish. I felt like a stupid person but I would sit there and just see as other people caught more fish than I did. As I got older it was still the same. I felt like shooting myself whenever someone caught another fish. I loathed every time a person caught a fish but I was patient. My dad always said I was going to catch a fish and I believed him. When I turned nine I went to a friend’s home for a party. He lived by a lake. Everybody except my family brought rods and reels. I didn’t have anything to do, so I asked a boy if I could borrow his pole and fish while he was eating. He said yes so I walked to the lake and threw out the line, feeling a familiar pang of hope mixed with doubt. I saw something big’s tail come out of the water. All of a sudden a tremendous tug on the line almost threw me into the water. I reeled in the line bit by bit so it wouldn’t break, my heart pounding with each crank of the reel. Finally I held the fish high over my head in a triumphant manner and beamed like the sun. I had finally got a reward for being patient all these years, proving that perseverance, even when tinged with frustration, can ultimately lead to success.
431	18314	7	3	The four sisters waited in line the second most exciting ride of their days at Cedar Point. Right behind Millennium Force, Top Thrill Dragster, and Steel Vengeance. The roar of the roller coaster and the screams of its riders zoomed by them until it started to get quiet again. ìI am soon super, doper excited!î said @PERSON5, the youngest sister excitedly. ì I know me to.î The rest said at almost the same time. Eight hard eyes moved at the same time watching the same thing. The Valravn! There were twists, turns, dives, and hills involved with this serious package deal. ìThis is going to be awesome!î. ìHow long has it been?!î asked @PERSON3 impatiently. ìHalf an hour.î said @PERSON6 the oldest, calmly, putting her long, dark, curly hair into a pony tail. ìPatience young grasshopperî said @PERSON4 who has the petteel the side of her face, ìThis son has really got to me ìThis is crazy!î agreed @PERSON1 with a look of displeasure on her face. ìLook my guys look! Were almost to the front!î exclaimed the second oldest @PERSON2 happily. ìFinally!î said a voice coming from the loud speaker. ìThank you for being patient, but we are experiencing some difficulty with the ride and it will be fixed as soon as we can. Thank you.î ì I really hope they finish it soon!î said @PERSON3 worriedly. Everyone all agreed. Everyone waited for about a half an hour when another announcement came on. ìWe again thank you for being so patient but this problem will not be fixed for another two hours. Thank you for choosing Cedar Point.î And the voice shut off and @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @LOCATION1, decided to go ride the giant swings, resolving to make the best of their day despite the roller coaster's unexpected closure.
432	18317	7	3	It was the day of central high school's football game and it was after school that I was in the parade with my football team. The line was going really slow and eventually we were done and it was off home with my best friend, John. Well, he was preparing me and I went to his house and played a little and then we left to go get some food. So when we pulled into McDonald's there were about 15 cars and they were all in the drive through and we sat in the car for about half an hour. But it was lucky because the game didn’t start until 7:30 and it was 6:45. So we sat there patiently and ordered our food and left to go to the football game, showing considerable patience during the wait. And that’s a time when I was patient.
433	18318	7	3	Patience is hard. You always **want** it now not later. You must stay calm and be peaceful in patience so that they almost forgot what they are waiting for but I always **want** it now too. I can't stand not having something. If there's a test on **Friday**. I will not be happy if the test changes to **Monday**. I just can't wait that long, and it gives my tension just knowing what's going to happen. If you have patience it's almost like a gift just like singing and dancing, a gift that allows you to navigate life's delays with more ease. Therefore, the ability to be patient is a valuable attribute.
434	18319	7	3	ìItís where?î The woman asked for the third time. ìDown the hall, to the left of the bathrooms,î I said for what had to be the fiftieth time. I grimaced as she walked out of the showroom, she didnít say anything. My dad worked for a small company that produced gift-shop-like knickknacks, like snow globes and the like. He offered me a summer job after my sixth grade year helping him out at work. Little did I know that what he was saying meant traveling to Chicago, standing in the middle of the hallway at a huge building, and telling people where his showroom was. When working in the manufacturing and trade industry, you often donít meet the smartest, well-educated people. You really need patience if you want to get anywhere. ìTwo dollars an hour, two dollars an hour.î I muttered to myself as a middle-aged man walked up to me. He read my name tag that had the blue- and- white company logo of Youngís Incorporated. ìHey, youíre with Youngís?î he asked. ì Do you know where the show room is?î I could tell what he was thinking. Why was an adolescent working for a cooporation? ìDown the hall, to the left of the bathrooms.î I said in a robotic voice. ìArenít you a little young to be doing this kind of work?î he asked. You were expecting maybe an intern? I thought hastily, but I instead replied with a complacent ìNo, sir.î ìHow old are you?î he asked quizzically. ìSixteen, sir.î I lied. I knew I could pass for a high ñschooler, so I knew heíd believe me. I was really wishing that he would move along, because I getting pretty edgy. I was already beginning to imagine what would happen if I grabbed his tie and yanked on it as hard as I could. Doing this all day was not healthy. ìAre you getting paid?î Not enough to put up with the likes of you. I thought. I took a deep breath, and answered, ìyes, sir. But itís not a lot. Itís more like volunteer work, really.î Please donít ask any more questions, I thought. He smiled and walked on, ìthanks son.î ìYouíre welcome.î I said through partially clenched teeth. I think weíll both agree that I was patient that day. And I hope that that man bought a boatload of stuff from my dadís shop, because if he didnít, I will be very put out, proving that even the most patient person has their limits. That is the time when I was the most patient.
435	18320	7	3	Patience, when a person is patient they can wait a thousand years for an answer. Or he/she is understanding of what the problem is when you are stuck. I always think they are a saint when they have the patience to deal with their wife, children, and job at the same time, and keep his cool. That is amazing. Patience is when the person is always there when you need help and he will give you patience by just being around him. I think patience is calm, doesn't lose his temper and helps you when you need a little boost of patience. Ultimately, patience is a virtue that benefits both the individual possessing it and those around them.
436	18321	7	3	I always have to be patient when I put way model airplanes together. Sometimes I have to ask my dad for help when putting together harder models. Like the B-17 - 1942 on the 1/48 bombers. I also have to be patient when hunting for rabbits, squirrels, deer and turkey. If Iím not patient I could miss a good shot or a good animal. I sometimes have to be patient at school with teachers and other students. These experiences teach me that patience is truly a virtue that benefits many areas of life.
437	18322	7	3	"At a time when I was patient when I really wanted to go to my favorite store. EARLY in the morning, I woke up and I told my dad that I wanted to go to my favorite store. TO my surprise, my dad said ""lets go."" So, we went to the store and it said that it was closed. FRUSTRATED, I check the hours and they were going to open in 30 minutes. My dad and me being patients. Well mostly my dad because he did not say ""let's go"" or anything. 20 minutes past and we had 10 more minutes to wait. Finally 10 minutes past and it was time, but the people that worked there said to wait about 10 minutes cause they had to set up things. My dad like always nice. He waited 10 more minutes, then we could go in. Now finally 10 minutes past and we got to go inside and I was SO happy. Being patient is the best thing ever, because it means no complaining or anything, and in the end, you get what you want."
438	18324	7	3	It was a nice sunny day outside, in the middle of the summer. It was so hot outside, it was like the sahara desert. ìhoney get your bathing suit on, and some shorts, and get into the car,î my mom shouted out the window. ìSeriously mom,î I questioned.îitís a supriceîshe answered. So I did what she told me while wondering where we were going. When we got there, I knew exactly where we were. Six Flags America. I got out of the car with a huge grin on my face. ìAre we going to go on the Superman Ride of Steel, want to come,î I asked my mom. ìSure, sounds like fun she replied.î When we got to this heart-throbbing roller coaster I looked, and the line was all the way to the end of the sidewalk. ìMom, I donít want to wait mom, its too long of a line,î I complained. ìBe patient, sweety weíll be on the coaster in no time,î she replied. One hour laterÖÖÖ ìmom its taking forever.î I whimpered. ìWe are the next ones in line,î she replied still smiling. So when the gates opend i was so excited and nervous, I couldnít believe that I waited an hour to get on one ride. ìYou were very patient,î my mom said with her hair sticking straight up. ìYes I was, and I am proud of that,î I said to myself, relieved that the long wait was finally over and we could enjoy the thrilling ride.
439	18325	7	3	One of the most patient times I have ever had was in downtown Chicago at one of the greatest pizza places around, a popular spot! As my dad and friend waited at our table, we were very hungry. It had been 45 minutes since we ordered, but I stayed patient; as much as I was mad and hungry, I stayed indefatigable for my food. Finally it came, and I was satisfied.
440	18326	7	3	"Honestly, I really don't have a lot of patience. I get angry at the smallest things. I got it all from my dad. Usually. I will get impatient when I'm waiting for my mom to come out to her car. Sometimes we are leaving for dance, sometimes we go to the mall. Whatever it is, though, if we are late, I freak out. Even when I am going to something small like a birthday party, I hate being late for it because everyone is usually there by then and I will feel left out. Sometimes I get impatient because people are annoying me. For example, when someone is making random noises and I tell them to stop and they don't, it really wears out my patience. I also can't stand when someone starts poking me for no reason, that really irritates me. Another thing that makes me very impatient is when my parents are lecturing me about something I already know when I'm getting in trouble and I just want them to finish already. Sometimes, it will be for not cleaning my room and my mom will be lecturing me, saying things she has told me a million times and it bugs so much I just want to scream ""stop talking"". Other times, it will be for not taking my dishes from my room, bathroom, or hook down to the kitchen. It's just a lecture that gets repeated and I already know everything they are saying, so I don't have much patience for that. It's frustrating to hear the same things repeatedly. I can get very impatient sometimes, but I still have some in me, so if you stay on my good side, it won't wear them, meaning I can handle things better if I'm not already on edge."
441	18327	7	3	One day on my birthday, @DATE1, I was over at my dad's house. My dad asked me where I wanted to go for my birthday. I didn't know at first, but then it came to me. I told him I wanted to go paintball shooting, and he said ok. But before we go, he asked if I could cut the grass for him. I said ok. So I cut the grass, which took me about @NUM1 hour and @NUM2 minutes. I told him I was done, and he said ok, so I took a shower because I smelt like wet grass. When I got done taking my shower, I called my friends and cousins to see if they would want to come, and they said sure. So I asked my dad when we were going to leave to go paintball shooting. He told me it was going to be on a different day. So I called all of my friends and cousins back to tell them it wasn't going to be today; they were ok with it. My dad said we were going to go before @DATE2 stars, and we have yet to go. And now, until this day, I am still being patient, waiting for that paintball outing.
442	18329	7	3	There are many times in a person's life when someone was being patient. Patience is a very important trait that could lead to its own rewards. I am a dancer at a school of dance. There is a very wide range in age in each dance class. Sometimes we have some trouble learning something as hard as a switch leap, or something as easy as a pirouette. Everyone who is in the class is so patient when these events happen. It may take fifteen minutes for the teacher to correct a footing position, and yet the other dancers remain seated, waiting ever so patiently. Patience also occurs while training a dog. Obviously dogs don't speak English, so they are going to have trouble learning. Yelling at the dog is a sign of not being patient which will not help the dog learn. But by praising the dog or correcting her/him gently, is a sign of being under control and patient. Eventually by taking up all that time to teach him/her the rules, you will end up with a great dog, all because you were patient! As you can see, being patient brings happiness and comfortability to others. Not to mention, it is what is respectful. Like I said, being patient is a very important lesson to learn and one should never forget it.
443	18330	7	3	@PERSON1 is waiting patiently when the class is talking. If the class doesn't quiet down, she will clap a third time until they stop talking or quiet down. When they quiet down, she will continue teaching then. When @PERSON1 is talking, we should be waiting patiently and until she is done talking to us. That is how @PERSON1 demonstrates and expects patience.
444	18331	7	3	PATIENT. One time I had to be very patient over at Barrymore's because we went into a line to go on go-karts that you had to be at least 10 years old or older to go. I also had to be patient on my birthday this year because I knew I was getting cool stuff, but I never imagined it would be this cool, so waiting was tough.
445	18332	7	3	I remember a time when @CAPS3's sister used to go on and on about @CAPS4 ice cream sundaes and all that. @CAPS3's mom had to drive me around all day because @CAPS3's dad was sick, so that meant the “@CAPS4 ice cream girl” had to come along too! @CAPS3's mom knew she was in for a long day. We were in the car and we drove past a McDonald's and that's when @CAPS3's little sister decided out loud “I'm hungry I want @CAPS1!!!” That is what she said yelling for five minutes straight. That's when @CAPS3's mom yelled “you speak another word about @CAPS4 ice cream you are not getting it!” @CAPS3's sister then had this face that meant she was about to cry, which was even worse!!! @CAPS3's mom gave her a cookie so she would stay content for a while; we started driving home when we heard a song on the radio, @CAPS3's sister loves to put the word “@CAPS4 ice cream” in every song so she started squirming while holding her tongue. She stayed that way all afternoon. She didn't speak a word that entire day! So we drove past McDonald's and then she started to cry. She had enough. “I want @CAPS4 ice cream!!” We were messing with her, so we went back to McDonald's and got her the thing she wanted most, her “@CAPS4 ice cream.” She was patient the entire day, she knew it was hard work. @CAPS3's little sister learned an important lesson that day, that “Being patient means good things will come to you.”
446	18333	7	3	A time I was patient was when I went to get my teeth cleaned, and after that, I went to the doctors. I waited three hours to get my teeth cleaned, and that was hard, so I took a book out to read. When I was on reading the book about two times, I got called to get my teeth cleaned. After that, I went to the doctors to get Wald, medicine refilled, and get some shoes. I had to wait for about two hours before getting called into the room, but then I waited a bit so they could get the shots ready. So I waited about five hours and five minutes; after all that time, I finally went to eat some lunch at McDonald's. That was all I did that day, and in the end, I was glad I had been patient because I got everything done.
447	18334	7	3	Loyalty is when individuals stand up for, and support something. I think everyone should show loyalty in your beliefs because that means that you believed and that you have a reason to be dedicated and driven to have a purpose. Loyalty means to me not backing down showing perserverance. I know a person who is always loyal and stands up for what he believes in. That person is my brother @PERSON1. My brother @PERSON1 is going to get into a arguement with everybody. My brother is loyal to the ìaliensî. I say that because he thinks aliens are real and doesnít cares about what anybody else has to say. I tried to confince him millions times there is no physical poof aliens exist. But he keeps saying that ì@CAPS1 are proof of aliens.î @CAPS2 my brother never lies to someone and always will have your back. If anyone says something about that isnít true he will defend you. He says, ìits not cool when somebody else talks about another person, all that means is that person has insecurities.î My brother never lets anyone talk about me without saying anything back. One last thing is that my brother stays true to himself. He never tries to be someone hes not. He said, ìI tried being someone im not and its not me. Im a nerd with street smarts, I mean I still watering carbons.î In conclusion, my brother is a loyal person for the simple fact he stands up for whatever he believes, even if its alien, wrong, or himself.
448	18335	7	3	"This is my story about being patient, I chose to write a story about a time I was patient. My way of showing that is me at a doctor's office and waiting for @NUM1 hours to get a brace for my friend's wrist. First, the settings are in the waiting room then an office, where we had to wait for @NUM1 hours. So, me and my dad were in this waiting room, it was supposed to be a @NUM3 appointment and she told us to sit down, and there were @NUM4 other people there. So I sat down thinking my mom was going to help. It seemed fine at first and it was a little bit of a waiting game, because I was trying to be very patient. But my dad was worried and then fell asleep. As people went by, people started to get impatient, many of them and made a scene. Then @CAPS1 hour passed by, @CAPS1 I said something about my life, but that was for my child, not my mom. Since they had ""or ion"" I jumped out of my seat and woke my dad up and went to find my mom. These people walked out after an hour, but I was still patient. So the doctor came in and gave me the brace, we got resettled in and left. That was a story about me being patient at the doctor's office and waiting for a @NUM5 minute thing, but in the end, I managed to keep my cool and wait it out, which shows a moment of patience."
449	18336	7	3	Being patient is good because then you respect that your problem will take time, but when you're impatient, you want to overcome the problem now or soon. I remember when my brother was VERY impatient. My brother Tom and I were waiting for a new video game to come out, but it comes out in 5 days. So he waited a day, checked the date, 4. Then waited another day 3. He wasted 2 days waiting while I focused on school. His grade dropped to a C+ and now he's blaming the TEACHER! So I told him hard work leads to success. He tried harder, slowly - he was using his time on grades while his game he wants is coming SOON, he's a lot happier now that he's patient, using time wisely while keeping himself occupied. Ultimately, learning patience allowed him to manage his time effectively and improve his grades, showing the value of delayed gratification.
450	18337	7	3	"It was a warm day, and I was sitting on the grass with the radio on. As my favorite song went off, I reached to change the program. But when I heard the man say Usher tickets were going on sale downtown, I froze to listen. I told my mom, and she rushed us into the car and got downtown so fast you wouldn't even see us leave. When I got to the line, it was so long it seemed like it went on forever. I waited and waited; it felt like it only moved an inch. I waited and still waited; I began to get mad, but I stood in line. When my long wait was over, I began to jump for joy. As I walked to the counter, she said, ""Sorry, we are all sold out."" I couldn’t believe it; I began to scream my head out. I did all that waiting for nothing; it was so unfair. And that’s the time I was patient for nothing, showing that sometimes patience doesn't always pay off as expected."
451	18338	7	3	Being Patient by: @PERSON1 A few years ago, I started to horse back ride. I love it so muc h. About @NUM1 month ago I ordered new riding boots. This is a time when I defien tly had to be patient. Me and my mom went on stake line tack.corn and ordered my new boots. When they arrived, they were too small so, we sent them back. Days and days went by as I waited for my boots. They didnít come. I had to be patient. Another day went by and my mom finally called them. They said when you re-ship something, I goes through fourteen day processing. Both me and my mom had to be patient. Weeks went by and still no boots. My mom have gotten a new credit card that week. Another week went by and my mom and I were getting impatient. She called the company again and they said when we tried to change the shipping to your credit card, it said declined. But @CAPS1 the problem is fixed and Iím glad I was patient enough to wait for the boots, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 riding comfortably in my new riding boots.
452	18339	7	3	A time I was patient was when I was waiting for my mom to pick me up from school at 3:30 PM. School ends at 2:00 PM so I had to wait outside for an hour and a half almost. It was winter at the time so it was about 20 degrees F. It was very windy too so I used my instrument case to block the wind and snow from my face. But that did not help much because I could not feel my face and I saw a clock inside the school and I found I had only been here 10 minutes! The wind and snow was terrible I was counting the number of teachers and people who left the school I was so bored. My face was red as a cherry. So I started reading to pass time but my fingers started getting cold and I was dreaming of all the hot things in the world. First it was hot chocolate then Christmas then it was Florida in July on a hot day. But I was staying patient as I could but it was very hard. I was cold as ice and I dug into my pack to find something warm and I found some gloves to go with my coat and jeans. I read and read with gloves so my fingers did not freeze. Then I see a red car looking like my mom's car and then it passed a wave of grief swept over me and I could not take any more! But when I stood up a car pulled in and it was my mom I got my stuff in the car and put the heaters on high and my mom said thanks for being patient, which made the long, cold wait feel somewhat worthwhile.
453	18340	7	3	Having a little bit of patience. Do you have patience or know someone who does? Well, that's exactly what I am going to be talking about in my own way. Once there was a little girl that was very spoiled and wanted what she wanted. There was something about her that nobody knew about. She had patience. Everybody always wondered about her; there was something special about her. One day her and her family were going out, and she couldn't wait, but you know what, she had patience. Also, she wanted to go get something from the store, the mall. She wasn't like other children, couldn't wait and always bother her parents; she just sat patiently. When they left, they went to Target, but they were rich, so they went to Nordstrom's too. She couldn't wait to leave, but you know what got her through, patience in the store and get that specific thing she wanted. When they got in the store, she finally got what she wanted; it was just lip gloss, five pairs of jeans, and shirts to go with it. She was nearly ready to go, then her mom and dad started looking around, but she had patience; when they got home, she was so tired, and she went up to her room and went to sleep. And they lived patiently ever after. I made this story to say we have to be patient and wait; that's how accidents and problems happen, and this little girl got everything she wanted because of one thing: she had patience.
454	18341	7	3	I was at the Detroit airport. It was around 6 am, the sky was bright and gloomy but no rain, just a warm breeze blowing in my face. My mom, brother and Dad pushed through the tall metal doors and saw everything from gift shops to our destiny where we would fly. We got our tickets and headed off into the plane. We went through metal detectors that caught nothing but my leather striped pink and brown belt. I slipped it back on and started walking. When we entered the plane we passed a lot of people I didn’t know. I got the window seat, and there my mom, brother, and I sat in cushioned blue chairs waiting in excitement and fear to fly off into the sunshine state.
455	18342	7	3	Patience is a very important quality in life. In fact one time I had to be very patience because my little cousin who live in @LOCATION1 had a pisered since birth. It takes her a little longer to ge things because she @MONTH1 where she her own little would but it not reality. So I was going to teach her how to ride a bike with truninig wheels but she tryed and she still know how today shes gotten way better but still has brain problems. So Iím taking her from horrible to better to good then to great. Sheís improved over the years it takes patience because she has a disorder. So you really donít yell at her cause shes very emotional and sencitive so you have to be quiet, nice, and have patience. So she will always be stuck with the problem but you can be patience and she will @CAPS1. That is why I truly believe patience is key, and with it, she will keep making progress and reaching her full potential in life.
456	18343	7	3	Yesterday I went to the orthodontist and waited for my check-up. It took a little while but it was my turn next. When I got home I felt like I was starving. I waited for dinner to be ready, but even though it was only an hour until it would be ready it seemed like it was a life time. The delicious aroma coming from the kitchen only made my hunger worse, but I sat patiently and read my book until it was done. Afterwards I was watching ghost hunters when my little brothers came in and started to clean up the mess they made with their toys. So I had to pause the show because they can't do anything when the television is on. So patiently, I waited for a excruciating ten minutes until they were done. So overall I think I was very patient yesterday, all things considered.
457	18344	7	3	This is the time when I was patient about going to the doctor. It was two days before I had to go to the doctor. My mom had told me I needed three shots, I never liked shots because they hurt and make you feel sleepy. I usually never have patience, but this time I did. I had one more day and then I will be at the doctor. I experienced why people should have patience and it's easy to do. Today was my doctor's appointment and I was scared. When I walked in the clinic I always feel sick and tired. My mom will go sign my name in and I feel more sicker because I will worry about how many shots I will have to get. My doctor had called me and I was terrified, my mom always told me that it doesn't hurt if you don't look at it. So I went back to the doctor's office and my doctor told me to get on the scale, I was relieved he gave me a hearing test and an eye test. I asked if I have to get any shots he said not yet but I might have to. When I got finished with my hearing test, I was finished and I was scared for nothing. When I got home I had learned two lessons one was not to worry about anything and I learned how to have patience, which made the experience much easier. This is when I was patient about going to the doctor.
458	18345	7	3	This past @DATE1 me, @CAPS1 mom, and @CAPS1 @CAPS2, all went to A @ORGANIZATION1í concert, @CAPS1 mom wasnt very excited, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was only excited just to see ë@PERSON1í, I was very excited just to be going @CAPS4 we entered the parking lot to the ë@ORGANIZATION2 music @CAPS5í @CAPS6 was a huge line at the door, it took up half the parking lot! But we had to wait in that line for an hour before we got in. When we got inside and to our seats, the concert was about to begin. It started to rain and of course it was on outdoor concert. So by the time the opening act got done I was soaked. Then people started setting up the stage for The ë@ORGANIZATION1í. We waited another hour and a half for them to finish setting up. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 mom were both getting irritated I kept waiting and staying positive. On the bright side it was an amazing concert and @CAPS7 glad I got to have the experience but next time @CAPS7 whering a hat!
459	18346	7	3	"A time when I was patient was when my brother, and sister, and I were told we were going to @LOCATION1; which is a big deal to us. My sibling and I were fighting in the kitchen about something stupid of course, when all of a sudden our parents called us out. ""Oh great,"" I thought. As I was thinking about what punishment we were going to get my mom broke my thought and told us we were going on vacation. ""Punishment,"" I asked. ""What,"" my mom replied. ""Nothing,"" I told her. We were going on vacation to @LOCATION3 and to @LOCATION2. But we had to wait one whole week. Every day my little brother would ask ""when are we going on our trip?"" and every day my mom would say the same thing. ""In one week, in four days, in three, days, in two days."" Finally it was the day to go on our vacation and my parents were proud of me for being very patient for a week waiting to go to @LOCATION3. That was a time when I was very patient, and it felt good to be recognized for it."
460	18347	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at my dad's office. We were there for an hour, and I needed to be patient until we left. It was not easy being patient because I was bored. I had to take an entire hour not saying anything unless my dad told me to. Remaining quiet and still for that long felt like a real test of my self-control, but I managed to do it.
461	18348	7	3	My dad can be very patient sometimes, especially when explaining things I don't understand. When he's not angry, he's usually quite understanding and willing to help. This makes a big difference in how I approach him with problems.
462	18349	7	3	"A time when I was patient was actually a few days ago. I was standing in line at Best Buy store with my mother so we could return a Roku box that didn't work. This was the third time we have had to return these boxes. I had to stand in line for a half of an hour and watch nothing but angry customers. Still it wasn't our turn in line. This one man who was up at the counter was not very patient at all; in fact, when he left, he slammed the door and mumbled stuff under his breath. Finally, it was our turn, and my mom was very patient with the worker, (even though she didn't want to be). The worker didn't know what was wrong with the box, so she gave her a new one, and we left. Being patient can bring good things, just like this quote I have always liked says, ""good things come to those who wait."" It is very true, so remember! Be patient."
463	18350	7	3	Thompson volleyball players aka @CAPS1 @CAPS2 lost our tournament. We went on @DATE1 at a @CAPS3 restaurant. And you know @PERSON1. She had asked for some chopsticks and the @CAPS1 made us wait for @NUM1 minutes for chopsticks. So @CAPS4 a volleyball player asked and she gave everybody some but the adults! We had so much fun. I had asked for some napkins but we did not get none. I was really made at the waiter but I had fun and the other girls had fun, so it all evened out in the end.
464	18352	7	3	One important skill you need in life is patience. With my new, hard cast on my arm, I couldn't do many things. I was a very active child doing soccer, basketball, cross country, and football. But, with my broken arm I had to be patient with my sports, accepting I needed time to recover. Being patient payed off and my arm healed faster without becoming but even more stronger. Then I played sports after I had my cast cut off. Patience can be rewarding, just if you wait long enough, showing that good things come to those who persevere.
465	18353	7	3	I was waiting for my grandpa to get home. He was gone to an Amish sale to find me a chicken coop for my chickens. I was helping my grandma can in the morning. I was so excited for him to get home. Then I went outside. I was doing work to pass the time. I first cleaned the barn. Then I did the cattle chores. I fed them, walked them, then watered them, then I cleaned the chicken coop. Then I did chicken chores. I collected the eggs. I fed them and I watered them. Then I had some fun, I worked on volleyball. Then I practiced hitting and pitching for softball. Then I worked on shooting hoops. Then I rode the gator for a little while. Then I went in for lunch. When I came back out I thought what can I do. Then I saw the wheat hill. I knew I would thrash some wheat. So I got out the slasher, went to the field and started thrashing. I loaded the tractor too. Then when I got back to put the other tractor out and attached the header to it, I went out and worked the ground. When I got back I was thinking what am I going to do now, when I heard a familiar sound, and pulling in was my grandpa. We got in the tractor to head to town, happy to have him back and with my new chicken coop.
466	18354	7	3	One time when I was patient I was playing a football game with my friends and the other team was creaning us, putting immense pressure on our defense. But even though we were losing and the score was heavily in their favor, I still managed to stay calm, focusing on the next play instead of the overall deficit. This allowed me to make better decisions, and we ended up beating them, showcasing how patience can lead to victory even when facing adversity.
467	18355	7	3	Patience is a hard but good thing to have because patience can help you progress in your life such as getting a job. One way you would have to be patient when trying to get a job is when the boss is reviewing your resume and getting to you at his own time. You donít want to get impatient and yell at him and tell him to hurry up because that would make you not get the job. So in conclusion patience is a good life skill to have because it can help our progress in life.
468	18356	7	3	Just be patient lucie said to @CAPS1. I will be done soon. How soon is soon? Awile. I will be done fileing papers in about an hour then I will take you to the park an hour? that is such a long time. Just go watch tv. but I dont want to leave me alone or when I get done I wont take you to the park ok. So @CAPS1 whent and placed vidow games with his little sister @PERSON1 for awhile, and made some pizza, and then his friend from school come over and asked if he and his sister wanted to go to the park with him and his and his mom. So he asked lucie if he could go to the park with ryan and she said yes just be back by five oíclock. and he and @PERSON1 had a great time. and ryans mom got them all ice cream. and he learned that being patient is very very important. It turned out that waiting, though hard, led to a fun-filled afternoon and a valuable lesson.
469	18357	7	3	"I've been to Six Flags before, my family and I went about a year ago. Their were so many rides! we were astounded of how many people were their. My family and I decided to go on the little rides first. We went on things like the ""kiddie trap"", ""rock star"", also many water rides. At the end of the day, my family and I walked in line to the biggest ride their. It was called the ""Goliath timbers."" The track was made out of wood, thats what made most of the ride scary to. Their was line of prolly 100 people. I told my mom I didn't want to wait long. She said ""you need patience"" I said ok fine ! It was the ride, it was pretty fun .After we got off I said ""mom that patience really paid off"", and I'm glad we waited because it made the experience memorable."
470	18358	7	3	When I got my bow I was very very very excited. Well I was excited because my older sister @PERSON1 got a bow before me and I thought that it was unfair. I had to wait @NUM1 whole year till I got my bow at @CAPS1 time. Well my mom and dad hid it in my bedroom in my closet; I never noticed it before. That is the time when I had to be patient when I had to wait to get my bow. Now almost every day I'm outside shooting it. Thanks for listening and reading. It was definitely worth the wait, and I'm so glad I finally have my own bow.
471	18361	7	3	Let me get one thing straight—I'm not patient. I mean, I can be at times but mostly I'm not. If there is something coming up, like my birthday, I will not stop talking or thinking about it. By not being patient, I just mean I can't wait. Most of the time, though, when we are going to a boring family house, I can wait. So, it really depends on the situation and how excited I am about it, showing that my patience is selective.
472	18362	7	3	Melted Fire. One day my sister and I have just woke up one bright Saturday morning at 8:00 AM. Mom was at my door. The light shined through my curtains and my covers. Mom pushed the door open just a crack and said, “Get up.” “Please”, I got up moaning “Leave me up. I’m sleeping.” Mom helped me up and hugged me while I was searching, I went in to the living room. Mom were in the kitchen and got what I thought was a paper hen, but it was aluminium. Dazed, I turned on the tv when I didn’t know my mom was on the coach. “Honey, go put the clothes in the diver”, called Mom. “O.K.” I asked, “(Do you) want to come down stairs to.” “No” he exclaimed. “Fine” I thought in my head. We walked down stairs in the basement to the laundry room when we finished putting the clothed in the dryer, I took a deep breath and said “Do you smell that?” Mom look frightened and said “No I’m cooking something. My eyes widened and I ran up the stairs until I reached the landing where the door was. I opened it and she pushed me out side hare coms. “Fresh air!” we joined. We were back in and crawled through the kitchen. We paused to stare at the fire; we ran towards Grandma still on the couch sleep. We shook her and shook her but Mom didn’t wake up, so I said “cover your ears. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!” “What wrong with ya’ll!” Grandma yelled. “The fire, kitchen, aluminium!” I screamed. Mom stood, we ran, Mom grabbed a cup of water and poured it on the fire. “I need to teach you how to cook better or until you won’t set any thing on fire!” I said, resolving to prevent future culinary catastrophes.
473	18363	7	3	There are @NUM1 different languages in the world and different dialects of these languages, in all that is more than @NUM2 different languages. But in each language patient means the same thing, understanding and tolerant. Everyone had to be patient at one point or another, let me tell you about one time were I was patient. It was just about one week ago when I got into a fight with my best friend in the world. And later that day I realized that we were both wrong. I sent her e-mails, text messages, and I called her cell phone and home phone at least @NUM3 times SHE didn’t answer or reply. I got even more frustraited the more SHE ignored me, then I talked to my cousin about it. ìYou have to be patient with her, this is your first fight,î SHE told me in a calm voice. so, I waited by the phone to see if SHE meassaged me back without using swear words, and I left her alone at school. Finally, one day SHE talked to me. SHE said ìIím sorry too, thanks for being patient with me. Iíve missed hanging out with you, how about we sit together at band?î ìIíd life that.î replayed and finally made up after five days of fighting. After this experience I learned that being patient does pay off. So wait your turn to speak, and understand why people say what they say and mean what they mean. Patience is always the key.
474	18364	7	3	The time I was patient is when I was to clean up my house and my mom said I would like me to get something nice when she gets back. So I started straighting up, vacuuming, spreading my bed, cleaning the bathroom, taking the dogs outside, cleaning their raven, did the dishes, took out the trash, and did the laundry. Once I was done with a lot, I would watch @CAPS1 play the game or on the computer. I waited about the whole day, and once she got home, she didn’t bring what she said; I forgot, so we were to get pizza. Even though she forgot, I was still happy with the pizza.
475	18365	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at the doctors office. I was waiting for my doctor to come out. But he was taking a really long time to come out and I was trying to be patient so hard to stay calmed and then the doctor came out and I started to feel better. I was relieved that the wait was over.
476	18366	7	3	One day me and my friend @PERSON1 were at @ORGANIZATION2 and we were in the line for the @ORGANIZATION1. We ran up to the line, and we had to wait about a half hour till we got on. But the good thing is that me and @PERSON1 were patient. After the ride we got in line for the @CAPS1! WOW! What a line, I think we were in that line for at least a hour and a half before we got on. But you know, me and @PERSON1 are really patient. The @CAPS2! What a day of rides and waiting!
477	18367	7	3	One day my dad needed his keys and I had them. His keys were somewhere in my room so I looked everywhere. After twenty minutes went by I still could not find them, but my dad was still patient. I destroyed my room looking for his keys; they were not in my dresser, closet, bed, or on my floor. I just had them to unlock the car, and now the keys were gone. Then, when I went to tell my dad, who was being so patient for an hour, I found them in my pocket. I felt so relieved and embarrassed after all that searching to find them where they belonged all along.
478	18368	7	3	Once upon a time, there were two kids. One was named @CAPS1; he wasn't patient at all. The other kid was named @PERSON1; he was patient. They went for a walk in the woods and got lost. @CAPS1 would not stop complaining. @PERSON1 told him to stop complaining, @CAPS3. @CAPS1 didn't until he saw a haunted house. @CAPS1 told @PERSON2 he wanted to go inside with him, @CAPS3. @PERSON1 didn't want to go in, so @CAPS1 went in and acted like he got hurt, so @PERSON1 ran in there. The door slammed shut, and the doorknob fell off. They were scared; it was dark. Then the light came on. @CAPS1 said let's get out of here! @PERSON1 said how did the doorknob fall off? @CAPS1 said I don't know. They ran through the house; there were no other doors or windows. They were terrified. Then a ghost was coming at them, and he said happy @CAPS7. It was their dad; he built the house for them and said all you had to do is push the door open. And they all went home, having learned a valuable lesson about patience and facing fears together. The end.
479	18369	7	3	Patience. If you are like me, that is nearly impossible. In fact, I can barely wait 27 hours for something. But I still sometimes have patience. Like when I wait for a BIRTHDAY party, I can manage. But this story is different. It was a warm day, even though OCTOBER was almost over. I didn’t care though because I was focused on one thing- my BIRTHDAY. Like most kids, I had waited 365 days until I would get a big pile of presents stocked up in front of me. When I woke up that morning, I knew it was still going to be a while to the party started. I played some sweet video games. Played outside and just kind of sat on a crouch until 12:00. I couldn’t believe it was only twelve. To me, it had seemed like hours just ticked away. I had to find something else to do. I decided to go to my friend's. We played some brutal, tiring football games before I decided to leave, when I got home I dashed to my clock like DEER in headlights 12:27. How, I do not know. I still had a whole hour until my party! The last hour MAY have seemed like a whole other year to me, but I’m still alive, right? My friends don’t know me to have patience and I don’t either. And trust me. I will never be that patient again. Ever. That kind of excruciating wait is something I never want to experience again.
480	18370	7	3	When I was pushed, I was doing my math at school. I couldn't figure it out. The other day, my aunt did it for me; it didn't help me at all. I almost quit at that point, but this time I was pushed and determined, and I figured it out, showing that perseverance can lead to success even when faced with initial difficulties.
481	18371	7	3	A time when I was patient is when I was at the food store waiting for my food. I ordered my food and they took a long time to give it to me. I waited so patiently. Other people were complaining in there, but they still did not give me mine, so I went outside and told my granddad that they were about to give me my food. I told him that because he kept asking me why they are taking so long. So I went back in the food store and asked them why are you taking so long, they said it's coming in a second. Then I sat down in the food store and I looked and saw my friends coming into the food store. So we started talking and waiting patiently for our food. Their names are @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @PERSON1. My name is @CAPS3, I was born in @DATE1, I was raised in the city of @LOCATION1. I was patient because I did not get angry and I waited. So then they called my name and said my food was ready. Then I got my food and told my friends I'm about to go home, after that I left. That's a story about a time when I was patient, showcasing my ability to remain calm despite the long wait.
482	18373	7	3	One day I was looking at a catalog in a store, and saw a goalkeeper shirt that I really wanted. So I went to my mom and showed her what I wanted. She said it was a bit pricy, but that she would get it. The next week was very long, waiting for the shirt. On August 12th it came, pale yellow, red, blue, and purple. I finally had a goalkeeper jersey to wear to games and make great saves.
483	18374	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my dad to come home from work. He had left on a three-day trip out of state, and a package arrived for me shortly before he left. I really wanted to open it right away, but I decided to wait. So when he came back, I got to open it with him, making the experience more special, even though waiting those few days felt like forever.
484	18375	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was my 16th birthday. Why because I was waiting for my phone and mom kept telling me that I was going to get it on the first of January. But I still didn't believe her, and guess what, my last present was my brand new cell phone and a case; now that is what I call patience finally paying off.
485	18376	7	3	"""Are they here yet?"" I said as I paced back and forth. ""Patience, it takes a while to get from the locker room all the way down here,"" said @CAPS1. ""@CAPS2! @CAPS6 on the camera!"" ""@CAPS3 got him!"" said @PERSON1. ""@CAPS4's right behind us."" ""@CAPS5 funny guys! You guys better give me back my clothes or I swear I'll @CAPS6 off the camera!"" yelled @CAPS7 as @CAPS4 attempted to grab his clothes and missed. ""@CAPS8! My patience has run out @CAPS7!"" I said, taking another picture. ""@CAPS10 I think @CAPS3 should put this up on the internet."" I continued, ""@CAPS11! You can't @CAPS5 put this on the internet!"" ""So you're going to stop picking on us?"" I asked. ""@CAPS8!"" @CAPS4 said. ""@CAPS13, then I'll just zoom in right here."" ""@CAPS13!"" @CAPS4 screamed as his towel fell off. So to show the little respect @CAPS3 had for him, @CAPS3 gave him his clothes, turned around, and walked away, ending the prank war, at least for now."
486	18377	7	3	Crack! I twisted through the air and landed face up with my arm wrapped around me. I felt a throbbing pain! I wobbled to my feet, ìwhat just happened?î I thought to myself. I once again began to feel the horrendous pain shooting through my forearm. I bit my lip hard! I could to choke back all of the tears from just pouring out like a waterfall. My friends launched toward asking me if I was ok! Soon, I started holding my arm. ìI think I might have broken it,î I replied in between sobs. They rushed to get an aid, quickly as possible. I soon found myself in the sick room after making a call to my parents to alert them of what had just happened. I sat there for hours waiting for my parents to come pick me up to go get an x-ray at Children's Hospital. They were both at work and were not able to come and get me. The day groaned on, I became more and more anxious. Finally, the bell rang it was 3 at last. ìBang!î The door swung open it was my dad and not far behind him was my mom. 3 is when they get out of work. After my mom and dad told me how much they were glad it was nothing more than a broken arm, they immediately rushed me to the hospital. That was my experience of a time I had to patient. And in the end, it turned out I had a broken arm. In life, there are going to be many situations where your going to have to be patient, but all you can do is take life as it comes at you; learning to endure such moments makes us stronger and more resilient in the face of adversity.
487	18378	7	3	"Jenny and Tom were twins brother and sister; every year a carnival was built up next to their house with games, rides and food. One day Jenny and Tom went to ask their mother, Lisa, politely for some money to go on the ferris wheel. ""Mom, can we each have a dollar to go on the ferris wheel?"" ""Sure, Jenny,"" said Mom, and handed them two dollars. Jenny and Tom were so excited they ran to the line of the ferris wheel. They waited and waited for an hour and it was finally their turn; during this time the man that was in charge of the ferris wheel had watched Jenny and Tom wait in line. As Jenny and Tom were about to step in the cast, two mean boys pushed them to the ground and took their seat. Now mama taught them how to be nice to everyone and they remembered that, so they got back up and let them go. When it was their turn again, the man in charge of the ferris wheel took notice of what just happened and told them that he was proud of Jenny and Tom and that they would go around the ferris wheel thrice more for their patience. After the ride, they thanked the man and ran happily home to tell their mom what happened; their mama was so proud of them and hug Jenny and Tom, reinforcing the value of kindness and patience."
488	18379	7	3	I was patient when I am hunting because when you have a bow and you can only shoot so far, perhaps forty or fifty yards, and you have to have the deer come in to a nice clearing, not behind brush. I think you have to be a patient person because when a deer comes close and you get your bow ready and then your mind makes you think like you. It going to come up close and then it walks as slow as possible and you just have to go with it, controlling your breathing and remaining still. And when all that patience comes to an end and you get ready to shoot and you got it then it really pays off, making all the waiting worthwhile.
489	18380	7	3	A time that I was patient was when I was in 3rd grade. It was after my birthday and I had wanted pink Nike shoes. My dad in another state said he would get them but he would have to buy them, send them to grandmas house and then have my grandma send them to me and that I would get them sometime after my birthday. So one day he called and told me he sent them and I should get them in one week. So I patiently waited for my shoes and in one week. They were not at my house. I didn't want to bother my dad and call him every day about them so I just patiently waited. After two more weeks I began to worry and get mad so I called my dad and asked him about the shoes and to my surprise he said that my grandma was bringing my shoes in an hour. So I was patient and waited one hour and my shoes still hadn't come. At this point I just decided they would just come when they came and I would just wait. Finally, I got my shoes the next day and I was estatic. I thanked my dad and I wore my shoes the next day knowing my patience payed off.
490	18381	7	3	"@CAPS4 I'm patient, and sometime I'm impatient. But no matter how impatient l am, my @CAPS5's even more impatient when it comes to waiting in a big traffic jam. He huffs at the long delay, sighs audibly, and gets very impatient indeed. He says things like, ""@CAPS1 on, @CAPS2"" ""@CAPS1 on!"" @CAPS4 it's scary to be with @CAPS5 in traffic jams, or long lines, because his frustration is palpable. But after the long line, @CAPS5's himself again, calm and collected, which is a great relief on my part!"
491	18383	7	3	A time that I was patient was when I was fighting my little brother in the backyard and then he kicked me in the chin and I promised him that I would not tell on him even when I busted my chin open the second time he kicked me and I fell to the ground right in front of everybody else. That was when I was being swarmed like a bunch of bees around a hive full of honey, with everyone asking if I was okay and what happened. Despite the pain and the attention, I kept my promise and remained silent about his role. That was when I was being patient.
492	18384	7	3	One time I was told by my big brother that we were going to go to Michigan Adventure so I was waiting till he would come home and then my dad told me that I should get ready to go so like to pack my shorts and **my swimming trunks** that so I did that then I just sat there for about **an hour** was then I called him and he said **he forgot**.
493	18386	7	3	"@CAPS12's the @CAPS1 of the ninth winning @CAPS2 swing @CAPS3 up to @CAPS4 full count, @CAPS5 bases loaded, two out. As the pitcher hurles a @NUM1 fast ball right down the center, @CAPS2 swong and hit his very first grand slam. The crowd exsploded, and @CAPS7 shouted as we were about to leave The anoncer said dont forget kits to day and today only down on the field the @CAPS8 players are signing atographs"". I beged and pleaded my dad to let the stay, @CAPS9 but he @CAPS14 agreed. @CAPS10 By the time I got down there these was a huge line. As time slowly ticked @CAPS10 those minutes seaming like hours. I could see kids geting ancie. I would have to leave if @CAPS11 my dad had not said ""The only way we ran stay is @CAPS11 if you are pertiant "". @CAPS12 waiting took forever, all you had to do was look around and you would see kids going nuts The little ones were crying. I could tell I was maby one of the last five people Being patient, even my dad was getting frustcated @CAPS12 It took at least two and a @CAPS13 half hours to get to the front but @CAPS12 it felt like @NUM2 days. I @CAPS14 finally got the whole trams autograph and I was so happy. I even supriezd myself that day I had no idea that I had @CAPS12 patience in me to be that patient for two and @CAPS13 half hours. On our way home my dad stoped at @CAPS15 Wendy's and got me a frosty, @CAPS9 and said @CAPS12 waiting was for being patient was not so bad @MONTH1 I'll be more patient from now and @CAPS16 always. That experience taught me the value of patience and the rewards it can bring."
494	18387	7	3	One day my mom, my sister, and I were going to the hair salon to get our hair done. It was so many people there talking. It was kind of noisy too. The TV was on, the radio was on, and a bunch of people talking. When we got there my mother signed all three of us in on the sign-in sheet, then we had to sit and wait. We waited for a long time. I really wanted to leave and come back another day, but my mom said we had to wait. I got hungry, and I was sleepy. We waited for an hour. I didn’t let it bother me, so I turned on my MP3 player and listened to it until it was time for us to come next. Then we had to wait another hour, and I got even more hungry, but I didn’t say anything. So we waited and waited, and finally, we were up next. And we all got our hair done. Then when we left, we went to get some food because we were all hungry. And that was a time I was patient at the hair salon. I'm glad we finally got our hair done that day despite the long wait.
495	18388	7	3	Once upon a time there was a kid named Jack. Jack had a little brother named Tim, and Tim was 6 and Jack was 12. Tim was annoying since Jack was a lot older than Tim and Jack had to watch him a lot. Jack had a lot of patience since Tim had to watch him every night because his parents worked late. But Jack still thought his brother was annoying. But see his parent’s knew that if they paid him then Jack would keep watching him so Jack did. But one day when Jack’s little brother Tim would not stop complaining because Jack did not get his way Jack finally got mad and said if you don’t stop that than I will not watch you anymore and you will have to go to day care.” Tim haited day care so Jack stoped right away. Jack was very mad at his brother because Jack was never like this to him. So Jack wanted to say Jack was sorry and Jack did and his brother for gave him.“I sorry that I was making you mad.” Jack said. “That’s ok,” his brother said. “Let’s try not to let that happen again” Jack said. Then the next day when Jack and his little brother were hanging out after school everything went well.“I’m happy that we are not mad at each other because I don’t want to go to daycare,” Tim said to his brother. “yah and I don’t want you to go because then I will have nothing to do,” Jack said. The End. Jack and Tim were happy to be brothers.
496	18389	7	3	There was a time when I went to @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. We were driving to @ORGANIZATION1, then there was a long line of traffic, so we had to wait. So we waited on a bridge for @NUM1 hour! It was a nightmare coming true. We got hungry. We really didn’t compliment the situation. But we were there for a long time, about @NUM2 hours we got into the park. So we were deciding which roller coaster to go on. We decided to go on the @CAPS1. We looked at the line it was a @NUM3 hr wait. We got in line. @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and my brother @PERSON1 were complaining a lot. Again it was a nightmare coming true. So my dad and I were fine with the line for the @CAPS2. Actually it didn’t take as long as I thought it would. After the wait we got on the roller coaster. We were laughing and scared at the same time. The coaster was over. I was sad. But it was worth the three hour wait. Later that day we rode the @CAPS3 the first ever built standing coaster I was scared again the wait was @NUM4 hours long. And @PERSON1 and my brother @CAPS4 were dying from the wait. But the wait only felt like an hour long. I was scared of that coaster. But I loved it. It was a lot of fun to ride roller coasters. We left after a while. It was a long day, but it was a fun one. The end.
497	18390	7	3	I am waiting to tell a story about the time when the video game SPACE BLASTER was coming out for PLAYSTATION 1 in 1999. The game would be the last game for the company Bunsie. I already have it and he is coming. I’m pretty good, but I don’t understand why your mom character stays on a planet called BLASTER and is the only Comsnap there, and then your entire game character gets bum-rushed by roughly 20 aliens with swords and they chop up your character into bite-size pieces with their little toy plastic swords. And the first time I went to buy the ones at TOYS R US at STORE X in 1999 their parking lot was filled with probably all 30-year-olds who live in their mom’s basement. So we waited and got it about one week after its release. We bought it, then we got home and it wasn’t the fighting game, it was some weak SIMON game so we returned it in like two minutes so that is my story on being patient. It shows that sometimes waiting doesn't guarantee the desired outcome and patience can be tested.
498	18391	7	3	When I was in fifth grade I wasn't doing so well in math so my TUTOR agreed on helping study for my upcoming test. So on SEPTEMBER 16TH I got up really early but my mom was running really late getting home from work, and she was the one driving me there. So my TUTOR was being really understanding and patient. So my mom got home drove me and we ended up a hour and a half late but my TUTOR was still very patient. So we started to help me and I was completely lost I didn't understand anything she was talking about but she still tried and was very understanding. I got almost every question wrong that she asked me and she still try to her best ability to help me understand it. She had to helping me for about TWO hours but she followed through and really helped me and I actually got a A on that quiz all because of her help and patience with me. I know it must have been hard to work with me for that long without losing her patience with me and I really respect that and I am very grateful to know someone like that.
499	18392	7	3	A time I was patient was @DATE1, @NUM1, @NUM2. I was sitting doing my meap test when my stomach started to hurt. For about @NUM3 minutes I sat there moving around uncomfortably. Then I raised my hand to ask to call my mom. When she called on me I asked her and @CAPS3 said ì @CAPS1.S @PERSON1 can you take ??? to the office.î And @PERSON1 said ok. Then me and @PERSON1 went to the office and I called my house phone; my sister picked up the phone. I said to her ì@CAPS2 me speak to mama.î @CAPS3 said ìhold up. Then my mom said ìit do.î I said mama can you please come pick me up; my stomach hurts reel bad.î @CAPS3 said ìokî and hung up. I waited about @NUM3 minutes sitting there patient, tosing and turning from my stomach hurting so bad. Then finally called agian ìI said moma is you comingì @CAPS3 said ì@CAPS4 on my wayî. I said ìokî and hung up. I was sitting there patient and in pain till finaly my mom walked through the school doors and signed me out; the @CAPS3 said ìcome onî my sister and ??? were sitting out in the truck waiting to go to the family health center. I sat in the front seat. I was sleep the whole way home then I woken up when we got there I went in the house layed on the couch and fell asleep, finally finding some relief after a long period of discomfort and waiting.
500	18393	7	3	My mum is someone who is patient. One time when I was little, I got gum stuck in my hair. I was crying a lot and moving around as my mom patiently tried to get the gum out of my hair. She kept on telling me to sit still, but she never got mad at me, even if she had really wanted to just stop and make me get it out myself. When she couldn’t get it out and said that she would have to cut it out, I screamed. Yet, with patience, she was somehow able to cut the gum out and still keep my hair looking nice even though I wouldn’t sit still. I remember her gentle hands working carefully, a stark contrast to my panicked state. I think my mom is the most patient person that I know, because whenever something happens, she is patient about it. Her calm demeanor helps everyone around her to stay calm as well, which makes her patience even more valuable.
501	18394	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at the dentists on the to get a cavity filled. When we got there they said my appointment wasnít for another hour, but my mom didnít want to leave. I was so bored, but luckily the TV was on. When it finally was my turn it took the dentist, who is also my neighbor, about another half hour to get ready. A learning experience is that I learned to be patient when someone takes too long to do something, and it taught me the value of waiting.
502	18395	7	3	"Beep! Beep! Beep! My alarm clock was going off and it was 7:00 and I already missed the bus! Rushing to get out of bed, I quickly got dressed. Hopeing my brother and sister was downstairs all ready waiting for me. Oh no! They weren't downstairs! Running back up stairs like the house is on fire, I went in my brother's room and yelled,"" WAKE UP! WAKE UP! We already missed the bus. I don't want right to my sister room. Yelling the same thing, she quickly got out of bed and got dressed. Walking downstairs, thinking very thing is going to be fine. I got breakfast ready. Then my sisters come running down. Henaling her food, she yelled, ""HURRY UP!"" She checking at the time. It was 7:15 am only 5 more minutes' so I started henaling my breakfast. By my brother didn't come down yet. Finishing my breakfast, I went back up stairs and wake my parents and my brother up. They came downstairs behind me. My brother just took is jelly time eating breakfast: We now that we were going in be late. She back at the clock it was 7:25 only 5 minutes! ""We aren't going to make it"" I said. Finally every one hoped in the van and parents drove. Are to school. My sister and I were yelling, ""HURRY UP! Floor it! "" parents ignored my brother didn't really care if we were late or not. Then finally we made it only 10 minutes late. I goes my brother is the only patient one in the houses."
503	18396	7	3	There was a kid named David who was always very patient. He always waited for everyone else and he never complained. That morning David just woke up and so did his five brothers and sisters. They all were trying to get ready for school within an hour. All of the bathrooms were taken up but David didn't complain; he actually used up that time to clean his room and make his bed. David was a little bit late to school. The Math teacher Mrs. Johnson said come here and the class said ooooo!!! Ha! Ha! David is in trouble. Mrs. Johnson said come here and David put his head down and walked as if he was pulling a ton. During lunch David was at the end of the line. Once David had gotten up there, there was no more food; it was all gone. The lunch lady saw how upset he was and she gave him a special lunch. Once David got home his family threw a patient party. David was honored and also happy, and realized his patience was appreciated. That night was the best for David.
504	18398	7	3	As my dad allways tells me, patience is one of the very keys to being successful in life. As I mature I find out more and more that patience is important. I remember a time when I had to display patience for a long period of time. My family and I took a trip to Cedar Point along with my friend. My friend and I could only think about the biggest ride in the park, Millennium Force. This ride gave me the most fun, heartstopping, adrenaline-pumping rush ever. But it would be a while before I could ride it. So we walked and walked, I began to get tired. After two hours of walking we reached the Millennium Force. I was disappointed to find out it's a 1:30 hour wait. The sun was blazing out. I figured the best way to do this was to keep quiet and relax. It seems that the more you complain the longer it takes. And before we knew it we were about to get on the ride! The long wait tested my patience, but the reward was well worth it, further proving the value of patience as my dad always said.
505	18399	7	3	ì@CAPS1 hour and thirty minutes, are you kidding!î I said as my dad and I got into the line for the ride the ìmaverickî at @CAPS2 point, which looked incredibly fun. ìThatís what the sign sayís, but it could take longer,î my dad replied calmly. I said in a disappointed tone ìI gusse we can wait,î but in my head I reminded myself you have zero, zipo, none no patience! Why did I say yeah. Right when my thoughts were done the line moved up a little. That was quick I thought, maybe this wouldn't be so bad. During that time to the time the line moved again I had occupied myself by watching people on the @CAPS3 and other rides go by, screaming and laughing. The line moved up again. Watching people didnít work this time, so I was thinking of how much fun the maverick would be to ride, and other rides I wanted to go on next. Those thoughts lasted half way in the line. My patience was running out fast now. I started thinking about how close school was, how much I wanted to go back, how I didnít want to go back, what I would miss, and was looking forward to. We were almost there, but I was losing patience every seconde. I started to tap my fingers on the side of my leg, a nervous habit. I thought nothing and just tapped my fingers and move up. We were finally at the front, and I didnít complain once! I got into a seat, and the ride started. At the end I was really worth it I thought, all that waiting. Now it was time to go on more rides and not complain, hopefully finding shorter lines. That was a time I was patient, and it paid off.
506	18401	7	3	One time I was patient when we were going to [City Name] for one of my baseball tournaments. It is like a [Number] hour drive through [State Name] and that is the way we went. I was sitting in the back of the car and I had an ear ache so my ear was hurting and I had to wait [Number] hours. Another reason is my little brother [Brother's Name] was trying to grab my feet, and take his stuffed animal and hitting me with it. I would tell him to stop and he would not so eventually I took the stuffed animal and he would yell at me to give it back so I would. The last reason is we had to wait [Number] minutes in a line so we could get back into the [Stadium Name] from [State Name]. Then when we were at the front of the line a guy asked my mom question and he asked my two brothers and I who the two people were in the front seat and we said “are mom and dad”. He asked that to make sure we were not being kidnapped. Those are all reasons why I had to be patient on our [Number] hour drive to [Team Name]'s town.
507	18402	7	3	A lot of people are patient and they wait because they don’t want to make someone mad or mess up something that they are doing. People always be careful of what they are doing. I ever be patient sometimes and it's not that hard to be patient, it is pretty easy. Everyone absolutely knows that, those people are out there, they know, trust me. There's many different things that I've been patient for, but I don’t know which one I choose to write, cause there is a lot of them. If someone is in the bathroom, wait patiently, but if you can’t hold it, keep knocking on the door or just use the other one, or if someone is on the computer then wait for your turn, but if it's been pass an hour then tell that person to get off not to be mean, but you either need on and have your turn. There is no way you can’t be patient for at least one or two minutes. Not too hard. It's pretty easy and everyone knows that too you know. Being patient is a simple thing that everyone can do when you think about it.
508	18403	7	3	I am going to write about a time I was patient. The time I was patient was when I went to Fuzzy's and it took a long time. It took 25 minutes. It seemed like took forever. It was a restaurant. I think the reason why it seemed forever was probably because I didn't eat anything. There was me, my mom, and dad. You can also buy ice cream. My stomach was hurting and I was hungry. I had tried to be patient. Some people have patience and others don't. I kind of have patience. But this time I had no patience. Now when I get a restaurant order it seems not that long. That is a time I needed patience.
509	18404	7	3	A time when I was patient was at the beginning of the year of the seventh grade. It was fourth hour and the principle had made an announcement saying that the sixth graders took too long at lunch and sayed there was a delay. So as the rest of the class complained I sat there calm and patient. It wasn't really fun just to sit there bored and hungry though so I just kept my cool. I remember just doodling in my notebook to pass the time while everyone else grumbled. Then eventually our grade was called downs to have lunch. That the time when I was patient over something.
510	18405	7	3	My mom was patient when she was in line for her driver's license; it took three hours to get her driver's license. She was angry, but she was patient. And the lady that would give the driver's license took a break; when she came back, my mom waited another three hours, and she still was patient. I was there too, and I was patient, but I wanted to yell at the lady for taking a break and making us wait for her for one extra hour. Another time, my mom waited in line under the sun; it was burning. The only thing she did to cool down was drink water for about two hours under eighty-one degrees, and she was still patient, proving her remarkable ability to endure discomfort.
511	18406	7	3	"The time I was unpatient. On the day of April 12th, I rose out of bed, brushed my teeth, got dressed, and ate breakfast. Then me, my mom, and my brother drove to the doctors, which is an hour from our house. I was not happy because I was tired and just thinking about how long WE are going to be sitting there just waiting for the doctor to say ""Everything looks good"" and ""You're perfectly healthy,"" but no, I got to sit there, staring at the walls. So now we're here, and WE'RE just so happy to sit and wait because my mom did tell me thousands of times, ""You need to stop being so unpatient,"" well I can't help it. Anyway, my mom just signed in for me, so I guess I'll just look at magazines... boring, boring, boring. They don't even have people magazines. ""Come on!"" I said. My mom said, ""You need to wait, WE'RE sure they will call your name any second,"" well not any second because it's been about 30 boring minutes. Ooh, lookie here, time for lunch, but no, we have to still just sit here and wait. Gosh, I'm so hungry. Well, finally, the doctor just called my name, and it's time to wait again! In conclusion, there's a time I was unpatient; I was unpatient waiting at the doctors, just sitting there; that's why if it has something to do with waiting, I'm not interested."
512	18407	7	3	Once upon a time there were two boys named @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. @ORGANIZATION1 was obnoxious and always had to time it his way. @PERSON1 always waited his turn with something and shared. One day while watching @CAPS1.V. they saw a rocket building kit and asked their dad if they wanted it. His dad called on the phone and said ??? and ???, if it ??? it would take @CAPS2 weeks. When @ORGANIZATION1 heard it was @CAPS2 weeks he threw a fit. On the other hand @PERSON1 said okay and went to his ???. Days would pass and @ORGANIZATION1 would always ask dad if it was around because he couldn't wait. @PERSON1 just took it like it was any day. @ORGANIZATION1 would sit by the ??? and watch the ??? the ??? with his locked. Eventually the day came. @ORGANIZATION1 ran out and picked his rocket up first. In that time @PERSON1 walked out the door. When the two of them had the rockets in hand they opened them up. @ORGANIZATION1 was disappointed because he wanted to play now but first he had to build it. @PERSON1 took his time doing step by step instructions and in no time his rocket was done. @ORGANIZATION1 just crammed pieces together and came out crooked and broke. @ORGANIZATION1 yelled loudly. @PERSON1 went to @ORGANIZATION1 and told him he would help and in @NUM1 minutes they finished. Together they played and had fun, showing that patience and cooperation can lead to a more rewarding experience for everyone involved. The end.
513	18408	7	3	Lost in Harriman State Park was early October, the leaves just beginning to change colors and flutter down above your head. My mother, sister, a friend of hers and I all piled into the car and drove a few minutes to the state park, which was literally in our backyard. I had my camera and I'm very thorough at getting a shot of everything. My mother and the others were very patient with me, letting me be slow on the hike. The thing about Harriman State Park is that there aren't very many trail maps so you can easily become confused or lost. After hiking a long way we come to a folk in the road where a map was. My mother checked her cell phone and told us we had forty-five minutes until we had to take our new kitten to the vet. I suggested we start heading back so we could get home in time to pick up the kitten and arrive on time, permitting the long drive to the vets. My mother instead of taking my advice, started us off in the completely different direction. My sister and her friend complained dragging their feet. For the next mile or so we continued without finding a map. My sister and I became increasingly frustrated with my mother and with being lost. Because we had gotten lost in the monotonous field and trees my mother had to get out her dying cell phone and call my father to bring my kitten to the vet. I was looking forward to taking him, making me further stressed. Finally after another half hour of walking we ended up at the exit. I was happy I almost kissed the car. Everything turned out all right and my mother was always patient with us we complained and moaned.
514	18409	7	3	One time I was patient was when I was in science class taking a test. I was patient because I went up to the teacher because I needed help and so did the kid in front of me. It took him a while but I just stood there and waited. It took him around 5 minutes because he needed help with a lot of things. I could have gone back to my seat, but I knew I also needed the teacher's assistance. That is the time I was patient.
515	18411	7	3	I have a few friends who sometimes ask me for help on something like school work or homework. Some of them take awhile to explain to and I must use patience in order to help them. And I'll be realistic, not everyone has a lot of patience and get frustrated easily, like me sometimes. And at times I have been on the phone for a hour trying to explain homework to one of my friends. Soon I will once again have patience when I tutor for @CAPS1, requiring me to carefully and thoroughly guide students. To me patience is one of the most important characteristics someone can have, especially when helping others learn and overcome challenges.
516	18412	7	3	I am not a very patient person. But when I have to be I am. For example at my house we only have one bathroom. I hate waiting to go. But I have to wait because I don’t want to jungle pee so I will wait. I also have to wait for my bus. I hate waiting its so boring. But patience is a good thing to have. If we didn’t there would be a lot of deaths by car accidents, murders, nervous breakdowns. My sister is very patient she can wait in one spot for hours; one time it was 3 hours. I was all fidgety from waiting until the bell rang so we can go trick or treating. She waited well, she did her hair, I complained; that is a reason why patience is important. Ultimately, showing patience, while difficult, is necessary for both personal well-being and societal harmony.
517	18413	7	3	"Have you ever been to the doctor? Well on August 15th, 2023 my brother, sister, and I had a doctor's appointment, so we missed school. When we got there, it was packed with people. So we sat down and waited. We had been waiting for three and a half hours, so I started to get impatient and hungry, so I told my mom I was hungry and everyone agreed with me. So my mom went to the food court to go get us some pizza and water. When we were done with our pizza, we waited for another three hours. I started to get angry because we had been here for a couple of hours. Finally, the nurse said kindly that my mom was next, so we stood up, then she said ""Thomas"". So I got so impatient I yelled out and said ""Excuse me, it's our turn, we've been waiting here for a long time, I can't wait anymore!"" My mom finally calmed me down, and I said sorry for my rude behavior. When I sat down and started to wait, just in a second, it was our turn. That's why patience is very important. I learned a valuable lesson about remaining calm and respectful, even when faced with long waits and frustration, realizing that good things come to those who wait."
518	18414	7	3	Patience is one of the most important things in life. Patience is being understanding and tolerant. For example a kids mom left for work she takes @NUM1 hours and she come home. The kid said ìthat was quick.î That shows a lack of patience and understanding of how time works. True patience involves recognizing that things take time and being okay with that. It requires a calm and accepting attitude, which is crucial for navigating the challenges of life.
519	18415	7	3	"For me, I'm not that patient because if someone is close to me or any of my friends, I will go off on them. I don’t tolerate my friends being picked on by someone they don’t even know, or I don’t know. There was this one time me and my friends were walking down the hallway at school. This kid seemed to come out of nowhere and started to push my friend around, and I asked the kid what his problem was. He said it was none of my business. I said, ""You're picking on one of my friends."" So, he stopped picking on him and tried to pick on me, but he didn’t know that I had my brother and other friends around the corner of the building. So, I had my one friend that was right next to me go and get them, so he did, and the kid that was picking on me ran away, probably because he realized he was outnumbered. I always try to stand up for my friends."
520	18416	7	3	One time when I was patient was when my mom's car needed a new battery and I had to go to school. My mom called her friend that lived down the street to come and give us a boost. We waited an hour and a half waiting on her. My mom called her back and she said she couldn't make it because she needed an oil change. After that we walked to the bus stop for thirty minutes, it picked us up and took us to Elm Street and Mrs. Johnson. Then we walked the rest of the way to one mile and Mrs. Johnson where there was another bus that took us to two mile and Mrs. Johnson where my school is. That whole ordeal really tested my patience, but I managed to get through it without complaining too much. That was time when I was patient.
521	18417	7	3	Patience is about waiting for something. Like we can say your new shoes will be coming in two weeks, instead of pacing around worrying all the time, you just walk around like normal. For example, hunting, you sit and wait for a deer to come. If you're impatient you would go look for some. Sometimes a lot of people can get impatient about something and become mean. Being patient is understanding why it is taking a long time for something. You have to realize if it doesn't come the day it's supposed to. This one time I had a DOCTOR appointment at 3:00 and my mom and I had to wait until five o'clock, and we never got mad, just a little bored. This one time a friend of mine was waiting for his dad, who didn't come home until the NEXT day. Being patient helps us stay calm and understanding, even when things don't go as planned, and avoids unnecessary frustration.
522	18418	7	3	Patience is when you are calmly waiting for something, someone or for something to happen. When I was little I went to the doctor to get a shot, but mom did not tell me it was for a shot, so I was thinking I was just going to go in and come out with a sucker. I had asked my mom when I could have a sucker and she said wait a little while, be patient. I went into the room and got the shot and got my sucker. I was angry with my mom because she knows I hate needles, but I also understood that sometimes patience is rewarded, even if the waiting isn't always pleasant, and in the end, I did get my sucker, showcasing that even in frustrating situations, patience can lead to a desired outcome.
523	18419	7	3	A beaker bubbled in the university lab. I could smell the sulfur smell wafting from the beaker. “What’s going on!” I yelped across the room. “I found the cure for the cancer!” he said as he had a little jublee dance that he showed off. I am a doctor and I wasn’t so sure but I told him I had a patient with extreme brain cancer. “Let’s go try it out!” he screamed. As I zoomed to the car, I waited while he packed up his lab equipment. After 10 minutes I was pondering where he could be. He’s just having a hard time packing up I said. So I turned on the radio and fell asleep. After a couple hours I woke up in shock. I had been sleeping 2 hours! I rushed inside to find him holding a ball of fur wrapped in his lab coat. “I saved this kitten’s life with my cure for cancer.” he said out of breath. I was glad I was patient or the kitten would have not lived. Just as I was thinking about how nice it was that he saved the kitten, my pager dinged. Mrs. Johnson, the lady with extreme brain cancer needed our help. He got one vial of his cancer solution and we rushed to the hospital. There I saw Mrs. Johnson laying there as translucent as light hitting off paper. I quickly got her heart rate down. At this moment I wasn’t sure if she would live. “Should I give it to her?” the mad scientist asked. I made a risky choice. “No, not yet.” I waited five minutes and then poured it in. Mrs. Johnson came back to life. Even though Mrs. Johnson couldn’t talk, I could tell by her smile that she was very thankful I was patient. Her daughter walked into the room and said, “Thank you.” I only smiled back, knowing the value of patience had ultimately contributed to a life saved.
524	18421	7	3	I am patient wherever I go to the dentistís office, orthodontist, or doctorís office. The first instance is at the dentistís office when I have to wait to get my teeth cleaned. I usually sit there and read magazines. The next place I am patient is the orthodontist; I sit and wait in the first room and cater to my I-pod; after a few minutes, they call me into the second room where I wait a little longer to get my braces tightened. Once I get in the office, I have to wait for the guy to tighten them. Finally, there is the doctorís office where you sit in the big waiting room for a long time and wait for the lady to call you in; when you get there, if you are getting shots, you have to wait patiently for the doctor to bring them. As you can see, a lot of things take patience. It seems that appointments often involve periods of waiting.
525	18422	7	3	"One day I had to go to the doctors office to get shots. When we got into the doctors office I had to wait in some uncomfortable chairs, with my dad. It was my first time getting shots, and I didn't know how it felt. Since I was little, it was harder for me to have patience, I just wanted it over with. I kept on asking my dad is the doctor coming yet, and my dad would always say patience. It got to the point when my dad was so frustrated, and he told me to go play with some toys; which I did not notice until then. But when I saw those fun toys gleaming in the sunlight I ran to them. But after a few minutes it got so boring, so I went back and sat down. It was getting so boring I couldn't take it anymore! I wanted to scream! But then I couldn't take it, I started to get so mad, wanted to just get out of there. But I didn't let my dad know, because I wanted him to think I was patient. I was about to yell as loud as I could, but then my doctor came out, and said ""Your name,"" and I was relieved that the doctor finally came to give me shots. But what I didn't know was that I was going getin horrible pain for a few days."
526	18423	7	3	I play hockey. I am a goalie. A good goalie is always patient. On my old hockey team me and the other goalie faced lots of breakaways. Most of the breakaways didn’t matter but a few of them did, and they were the hardest to stop. My team had never lost a game but we had a few very close games. In one of the games, the score was 4 to 3 and my team had the lead. It was towards the end of the game and they had a breakaway against me. The shooter was skating in from the side and he cut across the middle of the ice. It was tempting to go down but I stayed on my feet. I waited for the shooter to get to a point where he had no place to go and he shot and I stopped it. That was one of the only shots of the game and I stopped it, helping to secure our victory.
527	18424	7	3	ì@CAPS1 on hurry up,î my friend said. ìI know, be patient,î I said. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences without complaining. One day, we had a basketball game away at a different school. My team and I all went to the bathroom. I was the last one to go into a stall. They all left and one girl stayed. Being patient is all ways a good thing have you ever heard something like ìPatience is a virtue? Well if you donít get used to it. Learning patience can be difficult, but it can help you in many situations. Cultivating patience is worth the effort, as it contributes to a more peaceful and understanding approach to life.
528	18426	7	3	One time when another person I know was patient was when my friend stood in line for over an hour to get the tickets for the show we were going to see. This shows patience because my friend did not complain while standing in line, even though the line was long and slow-moving. This act of quietly waiting demonstrates a considerable level of forbearance.
529	18427	7	3	"One time my often best friend and I went to a ride, it was so hot outside, but the first ride we went on was called the ""Twister."" The line was super long; it was like going through a maze because of how the ropes were tied up. We stood in the line for about forty-five minutes, but it felt like two hours. I didn't really complain about it except for my friend; she kept complaining about how hot it was and how her large feet were tired, but when we finally got there, we started rolling to get on the ride. When we sat down in the rollar coaster, it was so much fun. I think it was worth waiting for."
530	18428	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I wanted a Wii for my birthday. But I couldn’t get it because my momma had to pay the rent. So I waited and then finally it was my birthday. I didn’t have it but then 3 months went by and it was Christmas and I got it and I was so happy. Another time when I was patient was when I had to babysit my cousin for $20. And I waited a few weeks for my uncle to give me my money but he did not. So I waited and waited for him to gave me my money. But not only did he give me $20 he gave me a late fee $10 and I was happy. And that added up to my money, that my mama gave me and it was $50 and I went skating and to the store with my friends. And I spent some of it at Claire's and on nail polish. They were awesome. Another time when I was patient was when it was 6 days before my birthday and I was leaving a sleepover I really wanted to go buy everything and it was like the next day was my seventh birthday. I did everything I had so much fun it was like heaven at my house, showing that being patient can lead to great rewards.
531	18429	7	3	Patience. Patience is something I have absolutely nothing of! I take after my mom in this area. My mom is probably a little bit worse than me but we are both pretty bad. Sometimes we record t.v. shows and watch them later just because we don’t want to have to wait through the commercials. Some of the other things I hate to wait through are lines, people being late and just plain old waiting around. The longest amount of time I can stay patient for is about five minutes any longer than that puts me over the edge. Oh by the way another thing is long car rides when I have nothing to do. I just wish we could have a 2 hour drive turn into a 2 minute drive but still end up at the same place. I really wish I could have more patience but I don’t know how to get it, and I know it's something I should probably work on. I really hope that you have enough patience to get through my story.
532	18430	7	3	One time I had to be really patience. It was when I was on my way to Florida to see my family. It took four days to get down there. It would have taken two or three days but we stoped a lot. My dad wanted to go to all of the stores and restronts on the way. It made me kinda mad because we didnít need to go to all of them but to my dad we did. On our way it felt like two weeks. My uncle Joe called us ever five minuts on the way. He kept saying things like how close are you, when are you going to get here, are you lost, and did you get me some co-co weats? I thouth that was really funny. My uncle loves co-co weats. I mean I like them to but not that much. When we finly got down there my legs hurt so bad from sitting in the back of my dads car. I walked around for two hours to get the feeling back in to my legs. That trip really tested my patience, but seeing my family made it worth it in the end.
533	18432	7	3	The time I was patient was when I went fishing with my step dad. I could not wait for long so I decided to talk to myself or sing songs to pass the time. My step dad said to set your pole down on a sling shot holder and do whatever you want while you wait for a bite. So I went walk around explore the world, looking at the trees and the water, and I was thinking about how I can practice patience. I went to check on my pole and I got nothing so I feel in the coast out for way so I sat wait and wait. But until that moment my pole start to jak around so I reel in caught a large fish! I was so happy and proud of myself. My step dad said see you do got patience. It turns out that sometimes patience really does pay off in the end.
534	18433	7	3	The time I needed patience. We were on the grocery store, a Walmart to be exact. When we first got there I was excited because we were going to get lots of junk food, but then we started to get lots of food and it looked really good. I started to just eat it all. The cart was half way full. Then we got more stuff and it was so full that we had to get another cart and I started to get hungry. But by the time we were in the meat section, I was starving. My mom said “Let me just get a couple more things.” So I waited, and waited and she told me to go to checkout. All of them were so long and I felt like I was going to faint from hunger. Then this little girl walked up to me getting smart. I couldn’t take it, I was about to talk that little girl down. But I had to calm myself, and I realized it was our turn and I was so happy. Finally, when I got home mom cooked bacon and I was just ready to go to bed, glad the grocery trip was over.
535	18434	7	3	As I waited at the airport, I gazed at all walking by I pondered these thoughts in my head: “when will Dad be here?” Mom, long have I been waiting and what time is it, wasn’t his flight supposed to be here 15 minutes ago? Then suddenly I heard a soft female voice “Dad will be here soon, honey don’t worry.” I don’t understand Mom, my mother told a 25 year old not to worry it was in our nature. I was about to lose my patience, but then I asked myself “what good does complaining do? It only makes you upset.” Ugh, these things ran through my mind, I gained back my patience. An hour later, I felt my mom shaking my shoulder and telling me to wake up. When I opened my eyes, I saw my dad standing in front of me, I ran to him and gave him a hug. “I almost lost my patience!” I’m glad I stayed patient because if I wasn’t it would’ve ruined my father’s trip. Patience is a good thing to have, you can gain or lose things from it. In this case I think I gained something, proving that exercising patience ultimately led to a more positive outcome.
536	18435	7	3	A time I was patience was one time we were at the store and I was excited to go to the toys section. “We were going to have go to the grocerys first,” said mom. I was really mad and mom said “be patice the quicker we do this the faster well get to the toys.” We are done with the grocery and then we have to go to the clothes section. I was really really mad. Mom said “the quicker we do this the fast we get to the toys.” I had to try on clothes. I hate try I on clothes,” I said. Then I was excited because we go to go to the toys selection I was happy. I looked, and look an then mom said “I could pick out a toy.” It was hard to choose I didn’t what to pick till I saw a cool truck. It had big tries it had flames and it was green. I asked and please please? An mom siad “u can get it” I was happy. And that was a time I was paticene, even though it took a while to get to the toy section.
537	18436	7	3	I was patient getting my PS5. It took forever to get it; I had to be so patient getting the system. It took me ten months to get one, and on my birthday, he drove to all the GameStops in Taylor to get it. I was in the car for hours to get it; we went into one, and at the first GameStop we looked at, they had one inside. It was in good condition. I got three games for it, and that was the time I was patient, a testament to my determination.
538	18438	7	3	Once apon a time, in a land for army, there was a girl named Lily. One day Lily and her mom were going to watch a movie called AVENGERS from PARIS. SADLY when they got to the theater, the tickets were sold and so they had to watch another movie. It mustíve been a bad day because once they got up to the ticket sold and remember to go to! Lily and her mom left and went to go eat. They went to a place called MACDONALDS and got in to order! They ordered their food, sat back down and ate. Once they were done, the left and went to try again with the movie AVENGERS when they did the line was as long as a mile! Lilyís mum just told her to be patient and wait I told about and listening to go???. When they were there, they finally got the last ticket available. After that her mom SAID ìso honey YOU were patient???When they got home??? they sat on the couch, got a snack, and waited for Lilyís sister and dad to get home. finally, they ARRIVED withe a big surprise and Lilyís dad was holding tickets to go see the movie Lily and her mom had just seen! ìYOU were trying to find you all dayî SAID her father. ìOH,YOU couldnít find you.î SAID her sister. Lily and her mom looked at each other and explained that they can go see the movie YOU were patient and waited in line an got the last ticket available!î ìAnd YOU won feifty dollars too!î exclaimed Lily. The END!
539	18441	7	3	I am going to talk about what I think patience is. I think patience is about waiting. For example, “you were very patient in line for cotton candy,” said the clown, smiling widely. It was a long, winding line, but the child never complained. You know, something like that. I know this is a short story, I’m sorry. But it really shows how patience involves enduring a delay without getting upset, and that's what I wanted to convey.
540	18442	7	3	I remember one day I was waiting in the waiting room in the doctors office with my mom because I wasn’t feeling well. We sat there talking for about ten minutes when my mom said “Wow it’s already been ten minutes.” “I wonder when I will get to go and talk to my doctor,” I said. “I don’t know but lets wait a bit longer,” Mom said. So as we waited and sat patiently more kids started coming in. I noticed some were young and some were older. I sighed. What is taking so long? I wondered. Was my doctor even here today? I stared at the wall and looked at the color of it. Orange. Before I knew it half an hour passed. My mom was looking at her watch. “Wow it’s almost noon!” “Finally!” I said flustered and annoyed. “Are we just gonna sit here all day?” I asked. Finally my question was answered as a nurse said I could finally come back to a room and speak with my doctor about my sickness. “Thanks for being patient!” the nurse said smiling. I smiled back. I had been patient.
541	18444	7	3	One day my mom said I could get this new toy at the store but my mom had to do other things before we went to the store so I had to be patient. I really wanted the toy. My mom had to go to where she works because she forgot something important. Then she had to go to the gas station to fill up the car. Then we finally went to the store and I got the toy that I wanted, and I was very happy.
542	18445	7	3	Patience can come in different ways in life. For one thing, it can reward you at the end. For example, if you are patient with your investments, it can come in a bigger way because the returns would be a bigger reward to you. Another thing is that it lets you do other things in the process. For example, while you could wait for a package to arrive, you could do something else when it's time for you to receive it. Another thing is that it might be difficult, but you can control it if you're calm. For example, people can't wait, so they just want to rush and get to be done with it, leading to mistakes. My final reason would be if you can do it once in your life, the second time can be easy. For example, the second time wouldn't be so hard because you would be calmer and more prepared. That is patience in my own way, and it showcases how beneficial it can truly be.
543	18446	7	3	"When I'm being a patient and I @CAPS1 nicely and I do not complain and I like to be patient and I @CAPS1 good I do not yell, and sometimes people need me to calm down. Sometimes when something is taking forever I sometimes say ""come on,"" but I always try to be patient at school and at restaurants. I always try to be patient everywhere, but sometimes I can't be patient. I don't want people thinking I'm weird or acting strange if I just want something. I need it, and I try to be patient in lines at the mall and at the fair. The fair sometimes has long lines, and that is my goal – being patient with everything. But sometimes I'm not patient because sometimes something takes too long, and I just like to be patient, even when it's difficult, because being patient is a good thing overall."
544	18448	7	3	In the writing prompt, I chose to write a story about a time when I was patient. I am going to talk about the time I skipped school to go fishing with my dad and my uncle @PERSON1. I didn’t get to sleep in very much; I still got up at about the same time I do to go to school. I had to get out of the house before my brother saw me because he wasn’t going with us. We got in the car and drove to my uncle @PERSON1’s house. When we arrived at his house, my dad started packing everything onto the boat. Once we did that, we hopped in my uncle @PERSON1’s old, rusty, red truck. The red paint was chipping all over the truck. We started to drive, and my uncle @PERSON1 had to keep watching the boat. The boat was very small. It just barely fit all of us. It was only about a foot and a half wide and about @NUM1 foot long. It scared me when we put the boat in the water and started driving. We went through a gorgeous river all the way to the back of the @ORGANIZATION1. The @ORGANIZATION1 we were on is called @ORGANIZATION1. It is in @LOCATION1. I was patient right when we got in there. I thought we were going to stand, so I was having second thoughts on fishing. It turns out, we just sat in there while we fished. We fished for a good @NUM2 hours that day. I was so very patient waiting for my bobber to go down so I could set the hook. “@CAPS1!” my uncle @PERSON1 said. It means that the bobber is going under the water like a submarine does. We had @NUM2 rods out at once! @NUM4 pike rods, and @NUM1 bluegill rods! I caught the biggest blue gill of the day that day! This day was one of the best days of my life! That is about the time I had to be patient on the @ORGANIZATION1 for @NUM2 hours straight, and it was well worth the wait for the memories made.
545	18449	7	3	One day I was at the store with my friends. I picked out my slurpee and got in line to buy my slurpee. Then an old lady got in line. So to be nice I let her in front of me. After a while she found out that she was a dollar short. So I gave her a dollar. She turned to me, said thanks, and gave me a mint. After that I bought my slurpee, and me and my friends had to cross the road. We sat there for 5 to 10 minutes but it seemed like an hour. We crossed the road and walked to my house. On the way to my house my friend had to use the restroom. So we went to the market. We had to wait for an hour before he came back out of the market; he told us he got lost. We walked home, and on that day, I learned that it’s tough to be patient.
546	18450	7	3	Two summers ago, I helped out with kids camp at my church. I helped with the preschoolers for the week and that required a lot of patience. They were very excited and rowdy. They were always running around and shouting, testing the boundaries of the space. I had to keep a calm voice and be patient with the children or it would make the situation worse, potentially escalating their excitement. Later on this week, I was put in charge of a young, special needs kid. He just couldn’t sit still! I had to remind him over and over not to be so loud, trying different approaches each time. He was very determined to get what he wanted, which made redirection challenging. It was hard to stay calm in the face of such persistent energy. Despite the hardship I managed to be patient and calm, focusing on his needs. The little boy decided I was all right and started to behave, responding to my gentle guidance. Now, every time he sees me in the hallway he says, “hi!” very excitedly. Now I am glad that I stayed patient, because I built a positive connection.
547	18451	7	3	One day I was at my aunt and uncle's house to celebrate my cousins birthday. He was turning nine years old. So we played games played on the trampoline. Then we came inside to relax and watch some television. We played with their dog after a while. Then a lot of people came over. We went outside for a third time and played tag. We had to come inside and clean up for dinner. We all ate turkey, baked potatoes, cheese potatoes, squash, beans. That was pretty good. Then they wanted us to do a project. It was a jar with a candle in it. We had to cover it in tissue paper and it uses lots of glue. I had to wait patiently I was the last one to do mine. So I walked waited quietly then finally I got to do my project but I was the only one there sitting at the table doing my project. It actually turned out pretty good after all. Being patient can get you very far in life. You have to be patient in a job, restaurant, and lots more. So remember just be patient and you'll be okay. Being patient will guide you through your whole life.
548	18453	7	3	On November 12, 2010, my mother was due to have her baby. I couldn’t wait; I was so excited. We went to the doctor's office and were shifted into her room (me and Debbie, my mom’s best friend, and her). When we got into the room, my mother was having contractions. She was yelling, screaming, and squeezing my dad's hand. I got scared while she was yelling, and I didn’t want her to get hurt. I walked out of the room, and Debbie and I went and got the baby, Lily, her first dress. When the baby came home, she was always crying; that's when I learned to be patient holding babies.
549	18454	7	3	Patience is essential when interacting with others. I learned this during a visit to the dentistís office. This past Monday, @DATE1, I had a dentist appointment, since it had been six months since my last one. As I was waiting to be called in, a boy came in with a severe toothache. The dentists decided to treat him first. I understand why they made that decision. I could tell that the boy was in a lot of pain. Shortly after the boy went to get treated, an older women came in with a mysterious pain in her mouth. It turned out to be a root canal issue, and they decided to examine and treat her before me. I also understood that decision. After the women went to get treated, a little girl comes walking in, bragging about her first loose tooth. Her mom said she wanted the little girlís tooth pulled. When the dentist called her back before me, I got really frustrated. The girl was in no pain at all. In fact, she was pretty happy she had a loose tooth. I didnít think it was fair that I had to wait another 45 @NUM1 minutes so that she could get her tooth pulled. I had to show a lot of patience because my appointment got pushed back over two hours. I thought about how I felt when I lost my first tooth, and then I didnít mind her going in front of me. All in all, patience is a very important trait that people should exhibit on a daily basis. I learned a very important lesson that day: Patience should always be manditory, and remembering how others might feel can make it easier to be patient.
550	18455	7	3	One time my friend was being patient, waiting for the teacher while he was talking to another teacher. After that, he was done talking with the teacher. Then she will get to ask her question that she needed to. That is a time when my friend showed patience. Therefore, my friend's behavior exemplifies the virtue of patience in everyday interactions.
551	18456	7	3	Patients is about many things. First, there is diffrent ways to express patients. Second, people either have patients or they donít. I admit I am one of those people that donít have patients. My mom is always saying, ìHold your horses.î I know. I donít have patients so why does she have to tell me I donít? I donít have any patients in grocery shopping I canít wait to get out but, everyone hates it right? Lines, lines, lines man do I hate them the take forever, wherever you go. Plus it is really nice when you let someone out if they are in a big hurry or somthing in a emergency. Plus the goodness in you just canít help it when you have a little girl that needs to cut you. So you see patients can take a toll or some people have no problem with it. It just depends on who you are. Patients has a lot to do with complaing. But not the way you think, when you are patient you donít complain at all you chill and go with the flow of things that are around you. Especillaly, when you are in a difficult situation it helps to have patient people than non-patient people with you. Well that talks about patients and how people deal, relate, and chill about it. Showing that ultimately, patience is a virtue that impacts experiences and reactions.
552	18458	7	3	I remember the time I got my new puppy, we had to be patient. We had to be patient because he wasn’t fully potty trained yet, and he was crazy. My dog is @CAPS1, and they are known for herding cows. So, whenever we used to go outside, he would bite our shoes. I don’t know why he would try to move us, but he did. We had to be very patient when we trained him; it took until he was @NUM1 and a half years old to figure out that he wasn’t supposed to do that, but (my dog) is still growing into new hobbies. We just have to stay calm and patient, and then we are able to train him. It takes a long time for @CAPS2 dogs to brave his hobbies, so we must stay patient. This is the time when I was patient.
553	18459	7	3	My mom woke me up early in the morning and said I need to get up and get ready fast. I asked what was the matter and she said were going to potter park zoo. I don't know why mabe just a sudden idea. I got all dressed and we hit the road. I wasn’t felling well that morning. We got subway breakfast. I didn’t eat my sandwitch tho cause my stumic hurt to bad. It seemed like two hours befor we finily got there. I was felling better now. We paid a got a map and stanted looking at all the awsome animals. I got to see two giant wolfs, snakes, monkeys, lions, pekos, camels, and a lot of other animals. It was so fun! We got to this bind cage that you can go in the birds are just flying around lose! There was a little boy in there and a bind landed right on the top of his head! Suddenly my momís phone rang. It was my brother. He said he was staying home because he didnít wanna get up. I could barlley hear my mom over the birds. She walked out and stood outside I followed her she was saying “No, because I said so you can't need to go any where.” Next thing I know she was hanging up. We walked toward the fish building when her phone rang. “Don't ever hang up on me agian! No, I can't need to fight with you! Its going to storm I want you home!” Suddenly it starts poring rain and my moms still on the phone. I was getting very wet and board I really wanted to see the fish. About five minutes later my mom hung up her phone. We walk in soken wet! My mom smiled at me and said “Thanks for being so patient!” Despite the chaotic phone calls and sudden rain, her appreciation made the zoo trip feel worthwhile.
554	18460	7	3	One time I was patient is when we had to do MCAP tests. I was one of the first ones done, so I had to sit quietly and read. I read most of my book. It took about an hour for everyone to finish. It was a very long time to read. I got bored, but I sat quietly so people could finish, and so I wouldn't be disruptive. Then when everyone finished, we took a bathroom break. It was hard to be still for so long, but I knew it was important for everyone to concentrate.
555	18461	7	3	One operation, I guess, is when I was a little kid. Patience is when my mom and my cousin Cindy were talking. My cousin told me when your mom and I are done talking, she told me to wait your turn, so I did wait for my turn. When they were still talking, I asked my mom if I could go ride my bike. I told my mom I could ride my bike without training wheels. My mom came up because I was going for surgery. I was waiting for the surgery. The surgery was some kind of procedure. So I was waiting until it was done. It was fun, a memory that highlights the virtue of patience learned in childhood.
556	18463	7	3	I test my patience when I was waiting for a bus. You know if you have patience if you said, for 30 minutes, you're at one time. You will know if you have patience then. I will be strong, but I will get unpatient at some time. You will never be all patient at a curse or a newer error. I was at a go-kart race, I had to be patient to see the results. I got unpatient, then I had to wait to get food so I can have some time to do what I want instead. So I know, surely, this month it will be better. That's how I got my patience.
557	18464	7	3	There was a time when I was patient. The time I was patient is when my cousins @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3 were playing the wii. And I said I play winner @CAPS1 my cousin @PERSON2 won and @PERSON1 didnít give me the controller and she wasnít sharing. @CAPS1 then I said she could play one more time then its my turn, instead she played four more times @CAPS1 I said @PERSON1 its my turn you played and I didnít, she said ìit is not your turn.î @CAPS1 then her mom said ì@PERSON1 you can play @NUM1 more minutes then its @CAPS2ís turnî one hour thirty minutes past and she still didnít give it to me @CAPS1 then I said @PERSON1 its my turn, and Iíve been patient for a long time you either give it to me or Iím going to take it, she still didnít it to me. Iíve been getting ready and you still didnít share @CAPS1 then she said Iím tired of it anyways. And thatís the time Iíve been patient, and it really tested my limits that day.
558	18465	7	3	"One time I was patient was when I had to go to the doctor to take my shot for sixth grade. I didn't want to go, but I had to go; I didn't have a choice, so I got in the car and we drove to the doctor's office. Finally, we arrived. My mom had to sign in, and we sat down. Even though I was waiting for three hours, I didn't complain about it. The doctor comes out, and I got scared but happy that finally it's my turn. Then he called a different name, so we and my awesome mother kept on waiting in the waiting room. Then my beloved mother tells me, ""Wow, you're not complaining now."" I know; I guess that's because I'm becoming more mature, and I have a lot of patience. Thank goodness the doctor calls my name, ""___[Your Name]___."" We and my mom go in the room. The doctor says, ""You grew since the last time I seen you."" ""Doctor, is this going to hurt?"" ""No, sweetie, it's not."" ""Are you sure?"" ""Positive, ok, ready, ya."" So I close my eyes and imagine something really nice. Doctor: ""Yeah."" Cutting. ""When are you going to give me that shot?"" ""I already did."" ""Really?"" ""Yeah, look at your arm."" ""Wow, I never felt one thing; see, I told you."" ""I think you are the best doctor in the whole wide world; I have to thank you, cutie pie."" ""You're very welcome."" With the shot done and my patience rewarded, the visit turned out to be much better than I had anticipated."
559	18466	7	3	"I remember the time when my older sister was so patient for her birthday on the fourth of July. Man, she was patient; every time I asked her, ""Can you wait until your birthday?"" she said, ""Yes, I can wait until my birthday. I can't wait until my birthday because it is in June until the fourth of July."" She was so happy; I just can’t believe that she waited for her birthday. She went to her friends' house, did some shopping of her own, and fireworks were in the air. My sister, well, that is how my sister was patient, handling the anticipation with grace and joy."
560	18467	7	3	"Ahh! I screamed in my mind. Baby sitting my cousin took a lot more patience (more her than me). All of it started on a Saturday at 7:00 PM. My family went to go do some drinking (I stayed behind to work on my homework). A little after my mom left I heard a knock on the door. My aunt come in and whispered ""you most certainly okay is if I left Emily?"" I replied ""okay."" Emily was asleep for about half-an hour. When I woke up Emily was still crying. First thing I did was pick her up and carry her around. Still Emily was crying! I thought her cloth need changing. I changed her cloth and... keeps crying. Now I had to keep my patience though because who would yell at a baby. Then I thought Emily was hungry. I didn't know how to make a bottle though I had to read... (Emily had no patience all Emily want was her bottle) still when I was about to lose my patience I made a bottle (not sure if it was good) but Emily drank it. Finally I put her back to sleep (if Emily cried one more time, I would finally lose my patience). Thankfully Emily was sleeping Emily looked in peaceful until Emily woke up. Emily started crying again (this time I knew why because Emily likes to be carried). By the time my aunt came back my hands hare sore. Although at the end of the day I figured out, that you need a lot of patience to take care of a baby; you need way more patience for a younger brother though, trust me."
561	18468	7	3	I am going to write about a time when I was patient. My advocate, @PERSON1, was supposed to buy me some pens for many of @DATE1 year as part of my @DATE1 money. I have been asking him everyday since then. “@PERSON2, @CAPS1 @MONEY1 do your daily shopping yet?” “No.” “@CAPS2.” I said, “because I want my pens, @CAPS4, @DATE1 present, remember the @NUM3 owe me?” “@CAPS5 I do, but be patient.” “@CAPS6 ok, my patience is about to fall apart.” I have been waiting ever since, trying my best to remain calm and understanding, even though the anticipation was difficult to manage, truly testing my capacity for patience.
562	18471	7	3	"Have you ever have to wait in line to get on the biggest roller coaster at a theme park? Have you ever wait until all your chores are done before you can play with your best friend? Have you ever had to wait for your little brother or sister to catch up? Well, in this story I will tell about one time that I had to be patient. During last summer I had to go to the doctor to get shots so that I could be safe. When I got to the doctor I had to wait in a room for my name to be called. It was so boring! And I was thinking, ""How long does it take for a few people to get shots so that I can leave?"" So I had to just sit there for about half an hour until my name was called. Then once I got into a back room I had to wait even longer for my mom to sign papers and what not, and also for the doctor to get the shots ready for what my mom told them to give me. But in the end I got to go home and play with my friend. This is once of many times that I had to be patient, and at least I still got to play with my friend, which made it all worthwhile. I hope you liked it."
563	18472	7	3	I was patient when I was waiting for a chance to go to Chicago. I really wanted to go see the Windy City because my mom went to college there. I tried to forget about it until I went. It kind of worked but once in a while it came back to me. Although I did stay patient and I didn't bug my parents about it once. It took a few years, but I kept my patience. Sometimes I even forgot I forgot about it. I just lived every day as if I didn't care about Chicago. No matter how tempting it was seeing Blackhawks or Bulls game on, I kept my cool. Then it happened in December 2023, imagine that it was 2010 and I was still patient! So, to put it in a nutshell no matter how long it took, I would be patient.
564	18473	7	3	It was July 16th. My sister was turning 10 years old. We were at Incredible Pizza setting up for her party. She had a pretty dress and my mom was curling her hair in the bathroom. I walked in and asked my mom if she could curl my hair. She said “You have wait”. I made a snobby comment and I sat at one of the tables. I was being patient. Finally, it was my turn. I sat there while she curled my hair. Later that day, my sister, two cousins and I all had arcade games at Incredible Pizza to ourselves. I was last on the bowling list so I had to be patient for awhile. It was finally my turn. I bowled and I waited. Bowled and waited. Finally it was time for cake and I had to be patient again. Eventually I got my cake but I was sick of waiting for everything. While my sister was opening her presents, I was thinking to myself, “she’s so slow,” so I walked up there and shouted, “Hurry up!” I got yelled at and had to sit out for a while. I should of been patient the whole day and maybe I would of participated in all the games. That’s my story I told in my own way, highlighting the importance of patience, especially during celebrations.
565	18474	7	3	"A time that I was patient was when I had to train my dog. ""Sit, boy,"" I command to my puppy. My dog instead of sitting runs at me, jumps, and grabs the treat out of my hand. I go and try to grab the treat back from him and he gulps it down. While walking to grab his collar and take him for a walk he bolts away. After chasing him for hours he finally stops and looks at me, waiting to run again. ""Come here I'm done chasing you lets just go for a walk, please,"" I say as I slowly lose my patience. I begin to walk toward him again very slowly. I get close enough to grab his collar, but then the dog bolts again, just leaving a bunch of dust behind. ""I'm done!"" I scream and walk away with anger. I begin to leave and go up the hill to my house. I go to my room ready to sleep. The next morning I wake up and go outside to try and train my dog. I lost my patience yesterday and stormed off, but today I'm ready to work hard and keep my patience. ""Buddy!"" I yell, waiting for my dog to come running, and he does. With my first command, I tell the dog to sit, and he does not, so I don't give him the treat. I say it again, and he sits! Finally, some progress after that waiting. I give him the treat and he starts wagging his tail. To see if he understood, I say it again. He sat again and got another treat. After that work with my dog I begin to ask him to do more things, sometimes he doesn't listen and sometimes he does. That was a time when I was patient with my dog to teach and train him, and it definitely paid off, as he became much better behaved over time."
566	18475	7	3	One time when I was patient was when we flew into @LOCATION2 to visit my sister at school. We flew to @LOCATION4 well, and then to @ORGANIZATION1, but after that it was downhill. When we got to @LOCATION3 we were stuck there for four hours! After an hour I got bored; my little brother being with us didn't help at all. Then over the interim, we heard that we had to go through security now and sit in a room with a gift shop, all for @NUM1 hours. When there was an hour left, there was another announcement and it was that we would be delayed three more hours. After that, I was listening to my iPod and luckily fell asleep for three and a half hours. When we finally got to leave, we walked up to a six-seater plane for us to fly to a small island nearby. When we got to @LOCATION1, we hurried to the island school to see my sister. That was one time when I felt patient waiting in an airport for @NUM2 hours, a test of endurance and a lesson in making the most of unexpected delays.
567	18476	7	3	@CAPS2 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3‚Äù I can hear the clock ticking, probably to annoy me. I can feel the tension in the small classroom building. Everybody is on the edge of their chairs waiting, why does @CAPS4 time seem so long? It's almost @NUM1 noon now. The aroma of pepperoni pizza is so strong that I can practically taste @CAPS4 time. This is agony. My stomach rumbles, so hungry. @NUM2 few seconds, can I wait that long @NUM3 again? I'm not sure. The tension of the whole class is so great, I think my brain will erupt. I can't take this, @CAPS4 time's way too much. My eyes flash nervously to the @NUM4 remaining seconds. @CAPS4 time seems to be an eternity, @CAPS4 time couldn't have been just a few seconds could @CAPS4 it? @CAPS4 time must have been at least years. @NUM5 gosh, why is time so short? I'm not a very patient person, not at all. But do I have any amount of patience? If I do, I'm not seeing @CAPS4 time go. I'm about to just jump out of my seat as if I'm ejected from a @DATE1 rocket. I'm trying to hold still, but anxiety is getting to me. If I knew that I'd be this anxious for lunch, I would have had breakfast. We're down to @NUM6 ten seconds now. My excitement grows, but so does the tension. @CAPS4 time's enough to crush me now. I think I might make @CAPS4 it to @NUM7 the bell. My stomach rumbles again, louder this time, begging for food, @CAPS5 pizza, demanding is more like @CAPS4 time. ‚Äú@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,‚Äù the clock mocking me, taunting me. @NUM8 five seconds, I can't bear this much longer. I think am about to snap. I don't handle patience well. @CAPS4 time's a ticking bomb inside me, just waiting to go off. @NUM9 Three seconds. @CAPS4 time seems the bomb and clock are counting down together. Both anticipating my snap. I'll show them. My will is stronger than my need. I can do this. I will prove I have @NUM10 patience, ‚Äú@CAPS10 done!‚Äù Finally, the bell goes off signaling lunchtime, releasing all the pent-up tension. I zoomed out like a squirrel who just sat on a snow cone, finally free from the agonizing wait.
568	18477	7	3	Some people have a lot of patience. I am one of those people. I have have had a lot of patience in my life. We were driving to @LOCATION1's @CAPS1 and I was getting antsy. I knew this would be a hectic day for my mom so I decide to be patient and read. Before I knew it we were there. I was waiting to get a lemonade with my mom and we had already been waiting here for @NUM1 minutes. I was starting to get tired of waiting in this long line for a little lemonade. But I knew my mom had already had a tiring day because my sister wouldn't stop complaining. So instead of complaining I stopped thinks about how long of would take to get our lemonade. I started thinking about what it would be like to ride the @CAPS2 and the next thing I knew we had our lemonade. I was starting to wish that we hadn't gotten in line for the @CAPS3 hawk because it was so long. I was really getting mad that it was taking this long to wait for a ride that was @NUM2 second long. But then I remembered that my mom was with me and she had a bad headace. So I shut my mouth. I was glad that I was patient that day. Because if I wouldn't have been the my mom probably wouldn't have been as happy as she was at end the day.
569	18478	7	3	One time that l was patient was when we went to Six Flags. We had to wait in line for an half an hour. We were supposed to get on the cork screw ride. I was very excited to go on that ride. So I decided to be patient. So for 20 min once we got to the front of the line l couldn't wait. So I hurried up and got on then ride. I really didn't like that day when l had to stand up that long. But, that what patience means.
570	18479	7	3	"On @CAPS1 while I was fishing in Little Traverse Bay for salmon, there was a tremendous hit on the trolling line. I launched from where I was sitting like a rocket. I heaved on the line; I waited. I thought it was a false alarm (snag), but trust me, I thought wrong. The pull did a dance, then bent really fast again. ""@CAPS2 on,"" I yelled to my cousin; he ran back to my aid. We @CAPS4 stared at the water; the pole, still flexed, didn't move. I was looking for the tumbleweed because I felt like I was in an old western movie standoff. Finally, I looked at my cousin and said, ""I have been patient, do you think I should reel him up?"" ""@CAPS3 me get the net first,"" he fumed and grabbed it, then stated, ""When you are ready."" I slowly cranked the handle on the reel, tie, tie, as I slowly cranked him from the freaky depths. Then, out of nowhere, the steel cable that was my line shot from the ball like a bullet, but the a quick jerk from him, and then the line went slack. My cousin and I @CAPS4 knew what had happened. The @CAPS2 I thought was going to be mine was now swimming off into deeper waters to frustrate more fishermen with his patient ways, leaving us empty-handed but with a good fishing story."
571	18480	7	3	Quite a few times my mom has been very patient with me. I tend to tell my mom stories about my day at school when I come home. Once when we were sitting there in the living room, I was telling my mom the story. As I go on and on my mom has the patience to listen to it. Though the story might have been boring for her, and extremely long, she listened, she made comments and never showed a sign of boredom. The expression on her face made me happy to know she was listening, and that makes me appreciate her willingness to hear me out.
572	18481	7	3	One time I was patient when I let a stranger cut in front of me to get some food at the deli. I figured they probably had somewhere important to be. And when me and my brother both had to use the bathroom I let him go first even though I was first in line, because I knew he'd been holding it longer. These small acts demonstrate patience in everyday life.
573	18482	7	3	Patience is a very hard thing to capture. The way I think of it, patience it is a gift to have. One time I had to try and **test** my patience was before a **Big Ten** football game. One part was driving there. It was **10 AM** and people were migrating to **Ann Arbor**! It took us **2 hours** to go **5 miles**! I was about ready to just run to the game! I could not wait any longer to go to this game! **Hold** your patience! my dad kept reminding me. Once we finally got there, out of the traffic I had to wait another **hour** before the game! How could I wait that long? Would it be possible? I just sat there in a lawnchair watching people drive by our tailgate on college game day. I just wanted to scream I wanted to leave and get to the stadium: so bad! Finally we took off from the tailgate. It was fun walking up with all the **Michigan** state fans, and tailgaters. Now I was sitting in this boring line just trying to be patient. Again i had to question myself I could be patient enough one by one people were getting in. I moved closer and closer, actually using my patience . When it was finally my turn I just ran right in so excited to have finally been in the stadium and conquer my patience throughout the day. It was great to finally be in there, having overcome my rushed feeling and letting patience take over me, proving that even in moments of intense anticipation, patience can lead to a more fulfilling experience.
574	18484	7	3	I was very patient one time when my grandma was in the store. She was trying to build the whole store, piling items into the basket, and I had to go to the bathroom real bad. I started to get real mad because I thought the store person that was ringing up the stuff tried to go slow so I couldn't use it. The only reason why I didn't complain was because most of the stuff in the basket was mine, purchased with my own money. It was difficult, but I knew I had to hold it in and remain calm for the sake of getting home soon, so that was a time I was very patient.
575	18485	7	3	Every year we have a family reunion for two weeks. Cousins, aunts, uncles come all across the country to enjoy these few weeks together. We go to the small town of Smithville right next to famous Four Corners Monument. The only problem is its a four hour drive, and if you know me Iím not that patient. My brother and I always rotate every year to see who rides with my mom. We flip a coin and I always lose. If you ask me she is the most impatient! But once you get there everybody is happy to see to wait for the handful of days of July to launch of our patience. And thats my story being patient.
576	18488	7	3	One time I had to be very patient. I had to wait five hours for my grandma to get to my house. Every hour I would go look outside to see if she was there. Eventually, she did arrive, and I was very happy. Some examples of how to stay patient are: Focus on something else. You could visit someone's house for a while, or even take a nap; these are examples of staying patient.
577	18489	7	3	My grandma is almost always patient with me, especially when she is teaching how to do something like cook or sew. One time my grandma taught me how to use a sewing machine. She taught me how to change the color of the thread, and she helped me untangle the thread, even though it took a while and I’m not the best listener, that took a lot of patience. Another time she taught me how to frost sugar cookies. I would get very involved because either the cookie broke or my frosting was lumpy and all over the cookie, even the bottom, but grandma put up with my complaining, and when I finally frosted one that didn’t break and the frosting was smooth, she praised me, even though I had probably broken half of the sugar cookies. My grandma was also patient with me when I helped her make caramel corn, which has many difficult steps, and if you do one wrong, the whole batch is ruined. She let me do the easy stuff mostly, but she also let me make the sauce on the last batch, which was fun, and when I started to go too slow, instead of yelling at me to hurry up, she asked me politely to go a little quicker, which must have taken a lot of patience. My grandma also taught me how to bake, which took a tremendous amount of patience because I was constantly spilling flour, vanilla, baking soda; anything in the recipe that could be dropped, I dropped it. I also never wanted to stay and clean it up, and when I did, I still left half the stuff on the floor. My grandma is always patient with me no matter what I do, and it's something I really appreciate and admire about her.
578	18490	7	3	A time I was patient was when I was going on the Raptor at Cedar Point. There was a two-hour line, and my friend and I were getting bored. There was some music, but that didn't really amuse us after a while. We started playing guessing games and people-watching to pass the time. But I had never been on the Raptor before, and I was really thrilled to go on it, imagining all the twists and turns. One hour dragged by, feeling like an eternity. Then, finally, just ten more minutes wait until I got to go on the Raptor; it was the best ride ever, completely worth the long wait and the test of my patience.
579	18491	7	3	When they had no idea when to get inside and how to protect their food. Our time is way easier than in the old days, they had to work hard at everything what everything is given to us. Our two time periods are a lot different. There aren't to many days where I am patient but this day was one of them. I was playing a football game on a great sunny @DATE1 at @TIME1. I was starting quarterback and I scored @NUM1 touchdowns and one passing touchdown just in the first half. At that point we were up @NUM2 and the coaches took out all the starters for the whole second half. I was expecting to still play but nope they told me to sit the bench for the rest of the game. This was very hard for me because I had to wait until the game was over to get up off the bench. I'm not a very patient person so this was @CAPS1 hard for me, especially when I felt like I could contribute more to the team's success. I hope I'll never have to do that again, as learning to be patient in that situation was definitely a challenge.
580	18492	7	3	I was patient before; I went hunting with my dad before, last fall. I was in the blind with him for a long time, waiting for deer to come in. He said they come in at night, or towards late afternoon. We waited forever, when they finally came in, me and him did not get one. Some other guys shot one and they all run way. We waited maybe, ten more minutes, and then went in; we were all there from 3:00 PM until 7:00 PM. I was patient the whole time, proving I can handle long periods of waiting.
581	18494	7	3	"One day, me and my parents went fishing. Our fish finder was going off like crazy but no fish were biting. We got to the point (in a short time I might add) where our dog would bark like crazy whenever we started to reel in our lines, even if there was nothing on them. We waited, and waited, and waited, but still nothing came. Every once in a while we'd have to move again because of the current. After we'd been sitting there for hours on end, I felt something on my line. I thought at first I was snagged on a rock, but as I started to reel in, the line came a little, and as I reeled some more, I thought it felt like a fish pulling on my line, so I called out, ""Hey, dad, I think I have a fish!"". Then my dad told me what to do. Eventually, I felt like my arms were going to fall off, but the fish came into view! While dad got the net and pulled the fish out of the water, I asked, ""What kind is it?"" He said, ""It's a walleye."" I didn't know what to say. My first walleye! And dad even said it was big enough to keep! So, then we went home, filleted the fish, and had walleye for dinner, making it a truly memorable fishing trip."
582	18495	7	3	It was a Tuesday morning at school, boring as usual, and my classmate came in on crutches. I freaked out and ran over to her, and she told me she broke her leg and wasn’t allowed to hang out for a whole month. It was hard waiting a whole month to hang out with her, but her safety was more important than my amusement. It was two weeks after my friend broke her leg, I was doing well not bothering her, so I was proud of myself, but I got to help her around school. A few more weeks later, she was almost better, so I was excited and went and bought her a gift. The next Tuesday, my friend was out of the crutches and cast and back on her foot; that’s the story of the time I was patient, and I learned to prioritize her well-being over my own desires.
583	18496	7	3	I am the type of person who you would call impatient, but I will try to explain it in the best way I can. The only time I am patient is when something existing on TV comes on. My friends are always patient for everything, like waiting in long lines @CAPS1, ordering food @CAPS2, and other things, but I am never patient. This difference in temperament highlights how individual thresholds for patience vary depending on the situation and personal preferences.
584	18497	7	3	"@PERSON2, get down here I need you to open an envelope! My mom said. We sprinted downstairs because an envelope can only mean, a report card, letter, postcard, or checking account balance. We got downstairs and we saw they had a camera out, and the envelope had a sticker on the back that said 98.1 radio. We opened it and it says congratulations you won tickets to my first Jonas Brothers concert with @PERSON1! I was just looking at them in awe, my sister was freaking out! Then, my mom told me that my aunt is going with us! Surprises just kept coming and coming. Another huge surprise was the lines about thirty girls were lined up at the front doors of the Fillmore oak music @PERSON3. Then security started to move and spread all the girls out, we got pushed about a quarter mile away from where we were standing. One and a half hours later we were waiting then I see this boys head pop out a window of the music @PERSON3 and say,""lucky girls!. After he said that about 25 girls went crazy screaming. One and a half hours later from that, they started to let people in. The theater was cozy and warm for being out in the cold for four hours it felt good. Iyaz Was the special guest to get us warmed up for @PERSON1. When he got out every girl was screaming their lungs out! He sang the concert and it was a great experience for my first concert ever!"
585	18498	7	3	One day during the summer my phone rang. Not many people call my cell phone. I dashed to my room, but my phone was no where in sight! Oh where is it? I swear, I was about to completely tear down every thing. I stopped I felt my back pocket and there it was. I felt like such an idiot. I was freaking out over my phone because I couldn't find it. When it turned out to be in my back pocket. Any way, it was still ringing. I looked at the contact. I was stuned to see who it was. It was my friend JENNA! I answered the phone and JENNA starts to speak. She wanted to know if we can have a sleepover in her back yard. I was so excited, but that same day my family and I were going to a fair. When I asked my dad and he hasitated to say yes. I packed my bags, hoped in the car and ready to go. I really didn't want to go to this peach fair thing. I just wanted to hang with JENNA. Here we are at the fair. I got out the car. My brother and I just wandered off. We whent on a few rides, played a few games. All I was thinking about was how much fun I was going to have at JENNA'S house. I was waiting and wating and waiting. Finally! Yes we can go. Off to JENNA'S house. I couldn't wait any longer. I was so excited: FINALLY I 'm at JENNA'S house. It's about time. I had no choice but to wait. In conclusion, that was one of the times I was patient.
586	18499	7	3	Tap, tap, tap. The tips of my fingers bounced off the arm rest with every movement. I had asked my MOM to hurry up BECAUSE I didn’t want to be late. I had told her like I have a million times before, “MOM, you know how much being on time for practice means to me.” BECAUSE I sat there slumped over on the couch, my backpack strapped tightly over my shoulders. This happens ALL the time, I thought my MOM would have learned by now. As I waited, I turned on the television to keep me busy. Unfortunately, with every flip, I became more irritated. “WHERE is she? Why is she taking SO long?” Thoughts like these swirled in my head. Then, my MOM came stumbling into the family room. She snatched her keys and we hurried into the car. As I snapped my seat belt into place, I flipped the switch to open the garage. As I sat in my seat, wiggling, the garage door creaked open. My MOM started the engine and we cascaded down the driveway and towards the road. Just to make my luck even better, we got caught in traffic. As the cars sauntered along, time was ticking away. The clock showed 3:15, I for sure knew that I wasn’t going to make it on time. I threw myself back into the seat. I closed my EYES and took deep breaths. Taking lots of deep breaths helped slow down my heart rate which allowed me to tone down my stress level. “BE patient.” I told myself. “BE patient. Relax, you’ll make it there.” ALL of a sudden my MOM slammed onto the brakes. My eyes flew open to see that we had made it to the pool. The time read 3:29. I was going to make it! I exploded out of the car with my bag on my back. At that moment, I told myself “see you can do it. You made it to swim practice, and ALL you had to do was slow down and BE patient. Great job!”
587	18500	7	3	I was patient when it was my birthday and I didn’t get anything. I thought I would get at least one thing but I got nothing. I didn’t do anything wrong but still I got nothing. The next day I got nothing; I didn’t ask for anything but I still got nothing. The next day I got nothing. But that night while skating at Skate Port at 7:30 PM I got something. Like at 7:30 PM I saw my cousin and she gave me $20 for my birthday. I thought that everyone forgot but I was wrong. I was so happy too. I had to be patient in order to get something and didn’t have to ask for something. It was a good lesson in patience, and a reminder that sometimes good things come when you least expect them.
588	18501	7	3	The blackout out in 2003. One day when my aunt Susan was watching me and all of a sudden all the lights went out. So I thought we blew a fuse so my aunt Susan went to go fix it and it didn’t work so she started calling my mom and the connection got lost so then we got our generator and watched the news and my mom got stuck in the highway traffic. I was worried so then we finally got our phones to work and some of our family came and we were so mad cause nothing worked for a week and we had to be very patient.
589	18502	7	3	"I v'e been waiting for like two hours. When am I going to get my food. I was hungry so I told my mom she asked me if I wanted to go out I said sure and went and got my jacket on. Mom said I got to go get dad, wait in the car so I went and waited for them for like a minutes. When they finally got out dad asked ""Did you lock the door?"" Shouted ""Are you ready?"" He said ok and we went. when we got there, there were no other stores that were open. When we went inside there were like a billion people in there. I was so hungry I could eat a pig. Metarorickly speaking. We went to the chicken area and we asked how long we would have to wait. And the guy at the counter said about two hours. After about 15 minutes, I started to read a magazine and some people left but the people in front of us went in those seats. We were next to go sit down but it took about an hour before some people left. I didn't complain at all and I didn't ever talk at all, and I talk a lot. And that was the time I was very patient, but the waiting has felt like forever."
590	18503	7	3	One time I was patient was I went to the doctors office. Yesterday I went to the doctors office and the waiting room was so full that we had to stand. Because there were so many people waiting we had to wait along with them. We were number 18, and it took us 2 hours just to get to sit down! It took a lot of patience because the waiting room time + the time waiting for a doctor about 3 hours. When I finally got in I felt so releived! It felt like I had an elephant lifted off my shoulders. Even though it took a long time, it was worth it now I am feeling better and back in school!
591	18504	7	3	Patience is sometimes hard to do if you are already excited. But sometimes you are acting like it, for instance, if one of your family members is talking & you are waiting for something else; that is patience. It can be especially challenging when anticipating good news or an event you're eagerly awaiting. Learning to cultivate patience, even in small everyday situations, can improve relationships and reduce stress, ultimately contributing to a more peaceful state of mind.
592	18505	7	3	I asked my mom if I can get a phone but she said no, not yet. She said I cant have one till eighth grade unless I get a basic phone right now and cant till ninth grade to get a real phone. I told her okey. But when are you going to get it for me. She said you have to be patient. I told her I will but when she said as soon as possible like on December 25th. I said I’ll be patient till then and will not bug you about it. That’s one time I had to be patient, and hopefully, I can manage the wait.
593	18506	7	3	One time me and my dad were at a store. There was a line about @NUM1 people; my dad and I were starting to get impatient, so I told myself to calm down and wait. But I was still not calming down; then, the very first person left, and then I was starting to calm down and just wait for the next person to go. I focused on the candy rack nearby, hoping it would distract me while we waited our turn. Soon enough, it was our turn, making the wait worthwhile in the end.
594	18507	7	3	My finger tips were icy as I sat and wanted. The seconds tarried into minutes, turned into hours. My body heat escaping rapidly like sand in the winds. I trudged through the mud as the slick rain hammered on my skin. I should have waited. I was patient as they explained it. But I didn't listen. I should have waited. I should have waited, wait have I shoulded. The words mixed together in my head, a jumbled mess. My bones cold, I was only about 10 yards from home. My legs refused to walk as they shuddered violently. Wait, be patient, I reminded myself, forcing myself onward. A cop car in my parents' driveway. I shoved my left leg through the mess of leaves and mud, patience wasn't a factor right now. Nine yards, eight, seven, six. I stopped, pulled my hood over my head but the wind and rain blew it off again, five, four, three, two, one. I was at my door step. I weakly raised my hand to knock. The bell rang faintly. Fast foot steps, the door opens. I am showered with hugs. ''You should have waited!'' my dad cried, tears streaming down his face. I smiled weakly, relieved that I had made it back, though I knew I had caused them undue worry.
595	18508	7	3	There was a person named @PERSON1. He wanted a video game for his @CAPS1- box @NUM1. But, his dad just got laid-off and his mom had a low-paying job. Since they had very little money, he couldnít buy the game. A few months later, his dad finally found a job at @CAPS2. But, @PERSON1 still didnít have enough money for the game. A few more months passed, @PERSON1 finally had enough for the game. His mom took him to the store to buy it. He was very excited to finally get the game he had wanted for so long. He ended up loving the game very much, making all the waiting and saving well worth it.
596	18509	7	3	Have you ever heard your mom or dad say patience is a virtue? Well I've heard it many times in my house, actually too many times. Patience is something that means you have to wait, like when you wanna go see a new movie on opening night. You might have to wait in a big line cause it's a new movie. So you're gonna have to wait with patience! And that waiting, while sometimes annoying, can make seeing the movie even better because you've anticipated it. So, even though it's hard, having patience can really pay off.
597	18510	7	3	A time that I was patient was during the summer of 2022. My friend Jessica was nice enough to invite me to Cedar Point with her family acoarse my pacents said yes. It was a 2 hour drive I think to Cedar Point, plus traffic it was fun cuz we brought lots of things to keep us buisy, we watched a movien on my iPad, listened to music I had no trouble waiting till we got there. When we got to the hotel we picked are bads then jumped in the car to go to Cedar Point it was awesome. First few went on the Corkscrew my eyes were watering it was so scary, then the music, it was so fast I felt like we were going to fly of the tracks. Next we we wanted to go on the malliniom force it the line was a hour long and we were in the middle of it. So it would useless to try to escape the line, then finally it was areturn to go, but it wasnít working so we had to wait, it wouldnít copperate so he told use that we can get free passes to go on any ride, and cut ahead of everyone but we only got to do it once. As you see us being patient, rewanted us, I think it was so worth it!
598	18511	7	3	Where was a time that I was patient, Dad, getting my first silly hamster. And patient is that you are understanding and tolerant. I was very patient and happy to get my first hamster. And I got my first *dwarf* hamster. And I got two of them. And they are silly and they bite. And my brother was patient to get his *puppy*. And patience is that you realized you wanted something bad, that you are unfazed and determined to get the thing that you want.
599	18512	7	3	I was patient when I was waiting for @PERSON1 to ask me out, and I'm still dating him to this day. Yes, he goes to my school. When he asked me out, I didn't know what to say because he took too long, but I still didn't like another guy but him. Being patient means not rushing through the wait for something or someone, like I did. When I was patient, I didn't ask him @NUM1 times; I waited until he asked me out because if someone doesn't like you, they might turn you down and hurt you. So, if you don't want to take my advice, you might get hurt, but patience can really pay off in the end.
600	18513	7	3	I chose to write a story about a time when I was patient. It was my first time hunting; I was only hunting squirrels, but still, it felt important. What I had to do was walk into the woods and find a good spot to sit. Once you sit down, you can't move, or you'll scare everything away. So, I was sitting very still for about 30 minutes, scanning the trees, when finally, I saw a squirrel darting along a branch. I slowly raised my shotgun, took aim, and shot her in the chest. I was patient, and because of it, I got a squirrel. So, that's my story on patience.
601	18514	7	3	I was at the county fair with my friends. There was a ride called the freak-out that we really wanted to go on. The line was too long so we decided to go on some other rides. We looked over at the line and all it was doing was getting longer. We decided to go get in line anyway. It felt like we were moving an inch every five minutes, I had to be very patient. On the inside I was ready to go nuts but I was calm on the outside it was the longest thirty minutes ever!!!!
602	18515	7	3	@PERSON1 and his dad were planning on going fishing on that @DATE1 @TIME1. They got everything they needed: fishing pots, tackle box, fishing nets, bait, and lunch. They drove down to the lake, got into their small rowboat and were off. @PERSON1's dad was the first to catch something. He caught a ten inch small mouth bass. It was too small so he threw it back and continued fishing. The lake was quiet today. There was a small breeze in the @DATE2 air. The sun was up but it was still a little cold. They sat there quietly, patiently. @PERSON1's dad got another pull on his line. He quickly reeled it in. this time he caught a twenty inch pike. Another one too small so he threw it back. ''The fish are really biting today hu?'' said his dad. But the truth was they had been out there for an hour and @PERSON1 hadn't gotten a bite. They fished for another hour or so before taking a break to eat lunch. They just brought sand wiches, chips, and a few waters. When they were done eating they went back to fishing. @PERSON1 casted his line as far as he could get it to go. He sat and waited for about twenty minutes when he finally got a tug on his line. ''I got one. I got one,'' he told his dad trying to reel his line in as fast as could. When he got it in the boat, they measured it. @PERSON1 caught a fourteen inch largemouth bass. ''@CAPS1 like you caught dinner for tonight ''. Said his dad. They stayed out about twenty more minutes then went in with a fish dinner @PERSON1's patients caught him a good fish.
603	18516	7	3	When I was patient I was in a store buying something and it was a long line so I had to wait to pay for my stuff I was buying. I waited and the person in front of me had a big cart of food and everything else so I had to be patient when he was up after I had to wait for all of the people to get done paying for their food and anything else. It was a test of my patience, but I understood that everyone has to get their shopping done, and eventually it was my turn to pay.
604	18517	7	3	As I get older my tolerance for patience has grown bigger. I was six and foretaken when my mother had told me to wait to get my gifts on christmas. After she said that I was angry at her and stomped to my room. I flopped hard on my bed and then eventually fell asleep. My mother had come in my room and told me I was allowed to open my presents, but before she did she said I need to have patience. Now as I’m older, I know most right from attitudes, so when christmas comes I don’t care about the gifts. I remember when she had told me to be patient to receive because you might not be able to get everything you want and when your patient and listen to what your mother tells you to do so she can explain that I might not get alot or what I want. So now my patience is great for most things, but since then I dont wanna rush and miss the details of what people have to say or I might get dissapointed. Patience is a thing where if you dont have it, then things wont be understood sometimes and things could not turn out the way you wanted them too. Taking the time to listen fully allows for better understanding. Enthusiasum is different from patience. Patience means when you wait and don’t want to. Enthusiasum is when you exited. People get those confused, so when a child is excited look for details and don’t say be paitent say calm down because they could take it the wrong way if you dont tell them why. In conclusion these are ways I was taughht to act, so please take my words into consideration, they could help. Understanding patience and enthusiasm, and how to communicate them effectively, can lead to better interactions and outcomes in various situations.
605	18518	7	3	Once before I went to Cedar Point with my friend John. I was patient on the way there. I was patient in line to get inside. I was patient in line to get on the dragster. I was patient to go on all the rides. Once I had to go to the hospital to get an echo on my heart. I was patient waiting for my results. I am always patient. Well most of the time. Once I went to Italy, I was patient to go through security. I was patient on the plane waiting to get there. I was patient to get off. I was patient for my luggage. I have to go to school. I am patient waiting to lunch. I am patient for school to be over. I am patient to wait till class is over. Like I said I am mostly patient, and that's a virtue I value.
606	18519	7	3	The best ride at @ORGANIZATION1 was over @NUM1 hours long wait. Bad news for me because I am definitely not a patient person. Like this one time I was waiting in line for an ice cream. There were only two people in line but I didn’t want to wait so I didn’t want one anymore. That’s how impatience I was, but riding the best ride in the world I was willing to wait. Two hours of waiting in line we seen a sign that said one hour from this @ORGANIZATION1. Very mad I kept saying to myself it’s the best ride you can wait an hour longer so I did. When we got on the ride it was fun but the ride was only @NUM2 seconds longer than I expected. In conclusion, the ride was fun, but the long wait tested my patience.
607	18520	7	3	It's cold, it's raining, I'm wet. It's been one hour and still no activity. All I have to do is wait. I'm hunting deer hitting with my new compound hunting bow. I'm a decent shot but not that good. I know patience is the key to deer hunting so I will just have to wait. I now see a deer about fifty yard away and shoot; so my patience pays off.
608	18521	7	3	Well this story was sequenced out about ten minutes ago. When I had to keep a tremendous amount of patience. Well as you can see there are multiple erase marks in the backround of my text, showing my frustration. I accidentally wrote part two of this test on this page! I am so glad I had such a caring teacher that found that for me or I wouldíve failed! When I was sitting down at my desk quietly, focused on my work, she (The teacher) walked up to me and held test up to my face. I knew that meant something bad. When she said I did it on the wrong page, my heart sank. I almost flipped out but I held it back, took a deep breath, and calmly moved to the correct page. I think patience is a great quality to have so you can get things done right, especially during stressful situations like tests. Iím very glad I have a good amount of patience, as it helped me avoid a complete meltdown and ultimately saved me from failing the test.
609	18522	7	3	The time I waited for party to happen. It was July 10th until I’ve been invited to a party at zapzone. He told me the party was on June 26th. Three weeks he told me that, and still didn’t have the party the he told that I had pay for myself accepted. But it was a party so I didn’t have to worry. Two weeks later I went school shopping for ten minutes. I came back he said he already had a party. He wasn’t there because a party takes an hour or two so I just let it go, deciding it wasn't worth pursuing further.
610	18523	7	3	Everybody loves @CAPS1Christmas, and they all have to be patient for it. Especially on the @TIME1eve of @CAPS1Christmas @CAPS3morning. Everybody in my family always gets very excited and canít wait until morning, especially me. I get so excited I can hardly sleep. In fact, last year had to be the hardest. It was @NUM12 am on @CAPS1Christmas morning and I had woken up for no reason. I decided to go back to sleep and did for only about thirty minutes when I woke up again. I just couldnít fall asleep! I went downstairs with a couple blankets and tried to go to sleep when I saw the huge amount of stuff just sitting there. I sat up and looked around at them. I was so excited but I remembered that I would have to wait until everyone woke up. So I tried to go back to sleep. I would close my eyes and sleep for about four minutes at a time and eventually stopped trying. It was @NUM24 am. I turned on the @CAPS5TV, threw in a movie, and waited. At @NUM36 am most of my brothers were up and I couldnít take it anymore. I snapped and started to complain. I had become very impatient. I finally was told yes and began to open my presents. I was finally happy, and the joy of Christmas morning had finally arrived.
611	18524	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was AT SIX FLAGS in VALENCIA, CALIFORNIA, we were waiting in line for this water roller coaster and the line was really long and they had this line called easy pass where you wait an hour ,then go to this machine to get a eazy pass ticket but we decided to wait in the really, long line .So half an hour later went by and I started to get really board so I asked my dad if he wanted to play this game called slapps .So we played for a little while went past and we were about half way there and we started regreting stay in the huge line because it had already been an hour so and we only move to the half way market .About ten minutes later I stopped playing slapps with my dad because my hands were beat red and his hands were barrely even red if that .So we just waited and waited until we were there three quarters the way there .After about ten to twenty minutes later we were boarding the raft .We went through a cave then stopped like fourty feet then splashed in to a huge amount of water .It turns out that wait was worth it .So that is a time when I showed patients.
612	18525	7	3	One time when I was patient was when we were flying to @LOCATION1. We were in @LOCATION2 waiting. God I thought how long can this take. But eventually the plane came. Once on I thought ok this is the last plane we have to take today. But then the pilot said it was to be a @NUM1 @NUM2 flight. Then I looked around to see what I had to do. I had my I-pod, a book, and the @CAPS1 in front of me. Once we were in the air I thought I would take a nap. But that only killed a hour so then I decided to watch a movie. I watched @CAPS2 @CAPS3. That took off another two hours. By then I was starting to get bored. I decided I would read. But after an hour and a half I finished the book. Then my I-pod come out. I listened to music until lunch came a hour later. After eating lunch which took @NUM3 minutes I decided to watch another movie. I watched @CAPS4 @CAPS5 which killed off enough @NUM4 hours. Then with only @NUM4 hours left I wanted to watch season @NUM6 of the office. Then when there was only @NUM7 minutes left when they cut everything down I watched us land in @LOCATION1. It was long but I was patient and stuck through it, making the journey bearable until we finally arrived.
613	18526	7	3	When I have patience is when I go out to eat. So no one can spit in my food. Like one time I went out to eat with my family, and we all were dressed alike for my birthday. So I asked my daddy to tell them that my birthday is today, and I wanted a piece of cake now. So he went to tell them what I said, and they said they'd give us a minute. So I waited and waited, and finally said bring me a piece of cake now or I will have this place burned down. Then my dad said bring her a piece cause she can have that happen. So they finally brought my cake, and they sang happy birthday to me. And I was happy after that until I found out they spit in my food and ate it too. I found out because before I left I heard some people talking about how they spit in my food. Then I said wait, did you in the fries? They said yeah. Then I said oh I don't care cause I didn't eat the fries. They said why? I said because the fries is nasty. And I rolled my eyes and walked away. But I don't do that anymore because I'm scared somebody would do it again, and that is why I have patience when eating out now.
614	18527	7	3	@CAPS2 @CAPS1 was a patient, @CAPS2 decided to order a pizza for them. The delivery man tells @CAPS2 that it would be at his house in fifteen minutes. @CAPS2 was still waiting for his pizzas after fifteen minutes. And how late the delivery man will with they be after being late, @CAPS2 said that he dosnt care. Therefore, @CAPS2's lack of concern leaves the delivery time unresolved.
615	18528	7	3	We climbed in the rental car waving goodbye to relatives as we drove back to the airport. “I can’t believe that the airport had an opening earlier in the day and called us?” exclaimed my MOM. “I can’t either. I mean out of all- Were here! Man that was quick.” As we rolled into the airport smelling that styrofoam smell, and checked in our bags. “Tickets to New York, two.” Mom explained to the clerk “Sorry according to this your flight is full” she told us through a cheesy smile. “But you called saying there was empty seats and invited us to exchange tickets.” “Sorry Mom it wouldn't be fair if we gave away tickets that were rightfully owned.” She smiled again another cheesy smile “Mom you can have your original tickets back if you like,” Two hours. Two! What am I going to do for seven hours! First my brother and I had races up and down the escalators. Then we took the shuttle bus everywhere. By three I knew the place inside out. Soon it time to leave suddenly the speaker came on Flight 25 to New York has been delayed by an hour and a half” Six now really? Luckily my Mom took me to an exotic restaurant. Beautiful restaurant soon it was time to leave. Please don’t get delayed again?! It wasn’t. I felt happy that we finally left but also a little sad. I learned a great lesson about patience! It’s not hard but not impossible.
616	18529	7	3	There are some key things in this world you need to succeed and one of those things is patience. Patience is when you understand things and tolerate them, and when you experience things that you do not complain, that's when patience is present. You have to have patience if you are planning on having kids or being a teacher or any other job you have to wait in lines for. Those are just a couple reasons why you need patience. The final reason that I am going to say you need patience is because in life everything is not just given to you. You have to work for it and to do that you have to have patience. So no matter what, if you don’t have patience you will have a really hard time getting through life. So these are all the reasons I think that you need to have patience. So if you don’t have patience learn to be patient. I believe that you can do it all you have to do is try to be more understanding of things and don’t complain about things that are hard in life; there is going to be a lot of hard things in life. There's only one more thing I have to say and that is just try. Just try to incorporate patience in your daily life, and you will find that it makes everything a little bit easier.
617	18530	7	3	One day I had to put up with my big brother all day. He went to get a cell phone I wanted one too, but I was too young to get one. So, when he found out I couldn't get one, he nagged me relentlessly. I wanted to take that phone and break it, but I didn't, because I played it cool. So when he got back home, I walked away from all of the nagging. I went to do something else, but he kept following me, so I found a big tree that he could not get up to and hung out there till he left. After that, I went to go in, but I had got locked out. I thought, man, should I have got a plane? It was definitely a frustrating day dealing with his teasing and then being locked out, making me wish for a quick escape. Thanks for listening.
618	18531	7	3	The time I was very, very patient was when I was about seven and me, Mom, Dad, sister, brothers, and Grandma from up north (where we got my grandma) drove to West Virginia and back. Most of the time I was sleeping or waking up somewhere, eating, playing at a hotel pool. Sleep and then hit the road the next day. The thing that I had to be so patient about was that we were going to have Christmas there so I wanted to open my presents. And one time we got stuck in traffic so that slowed us down about an hour or so. So when we finally got there I jumped out, ran as fast as I could, opened the door and surprise, Merry Christmas, guys. All that waiting definitely tested my young self, but the surprise made it all worthwhile.
619	18533	7	3	One time when I was playing video games, I was waiting around the corner for a guy to walk around. I waited for like @NUM1 minutes, controller in hand. Then there he is. I waited to kill as he walked past; boom, assassinating, that was the time I had patience.
620	18534	7	3	One time my friend told me to read this book, so l borrowed it from her. The name of the book is called ìThe Vampire Diariesî. Itís also a tv show on the CW. I was reading the books and one of the main characters named Damon, brother of Stefan are vampires. They turned into a vampire because of a girl named Katherine. Damon and Stefan died because they were trying to save Katherine, or so everyone thought. Katherine gave them enough blood so they wouldnít die, they would become a vampire. They thought Katherine was in the tume because that was were everyone was taking the vampires because the town found out there was vampires there. Damon came back after 145 years searching for something to help get Katherine out of the tume, I think that is patience. Waiting for 145 years trying to find something to help get your true love out of trouble. He waited a long time. I believe patience is waiting a long time to do something and you donít complain while doing it.
621	18535	7	3	I remember when I wanted to ride my dirt bike and my dad was busy, and I waited till he had time to put gas in it. When @PERSON1 wanted to ask a question he had, but he had to wait and then asked the question when the opportunity finally arose.
622	18536	7	3	When I was 8 years old my mother and sister were working and cleaning around the house and I kept asking ìcan we go to get pizza?î But every time I asked she would reply, ìif you help us and we finish before dinner, we can go get pizzaî. I didnít want to wash windows, clean my room or wash the car. So I waited on the playground in the back yard swinging and going down the slide, but after 20 minutes, it got boring. After that, thats when I knew I would have to be patient. I ran down the hill to the river and waded into its cold water. But I was still bored. I got out of the river and ran to Mom. ìMom and Sarah are you done yet?î I asked. ìWere done with the house but the car has yet to be washedî she answered. I walk to my bike and got my helmet which is sitting on my bike seat. The wind in my face was nothing compared to eating pizza, but somehow driving up and down the drive way was more entertaining than cleaning. I hop of my bicycle and ran into the house, taking two immediate lefts after entering the house I look up at the clock, 4:25 p.m it said. My family always has dinner at 5:35 because my dad gets home from work at 5:00 and cooks dinner. I rush to see if my Mom and sister were done yet, ìAre you done?î I asked rudely. ìYou could help if you want it to fasterî Mom answers. ìOkay, fine Iíll helpî, I grab the hose and spray the dirt and bird poop off the windows. After 15 minutes of cleaning we were done, Mom left dad a note and she said, ìlets do!î After the whole day I waited 6 hours for my Mom and sister to finish, in the end I finished the job, which taught me patience and the value of contributing to a shared goal.
623	18537	7	3	One day when I was patient was when we all had to go on the same ride at Six Flags. It seemed like everyone was determined to go on this one ride, and there were tons of people in line for it. I had to wait patiently in line because I was in the back, and we were there for about half an hour waiting to go on the ride. After we waited there patiently, the ride was dumb; it did not even go up five sets of stairs. After that letdown, we went on a whole bunch of water park rides and then went home, ending the day on a much more fun note.
624	18538	7	3	Patience in my words is to be able to wait a long time for something and not be angry and not raise your blood pressure. Patience is a good thing to have because if you didn’t have patience you would probably never be able to accomplish anything that takes time to do. I think that being patient would help you succeed in many things. For an example, me and my mom were in the @ORGANIZATION1 drive through and the lady in front of us was yelling at the people in the line to go faster; when you do something like that, it’s most likely not going to speed things up. My mom has outstanding patience because she can wait for things for hours and not get frustrated. I rarely have patience; I can't wait more than around ten minutes for something. Patience is a great thing because you most likely won’t get things done without it. Most of my family and I don’t have the best patience, but we sometimes do. I think that patience is very good to have, and it is a virtue worth cultivating to lead a more successful and peaceful life.
625	18539	7	3	My mom wasn't patient because when I came home late from the park she was impatient, but she wasn't patient when she took the phone away from me, she wasn't patient. When my brother gets in trouble, she has patience for him and my sister but none for me. Just because I came home 15 minutes late, she said she had patience before I did that, and now she has a little bit of patience for me, just a little. It feels unfair because it seems her patience is conditional, varying based on who's involved and what happened.
626	18540	7	3	A time when I was patient is when it was winter time and my cousin and I really wanted to go outside. My mom kept saying “you will be able to go out.” My cousin was very mad; she was having a fit. I was just sitting there on my couch, calmly telling her what my mom said. After an hour passed, I was able to go outside, but my cousin could not because she wasn’t being patient. That is a time when I was patient, and it taught me that sometimes waiting is the best course of action.
627	18541	7	3	One time I was patient because I was hunting; it was a cold October play. I was sitting in a blind with my dad, waiting for a deer. It was almost eight o'clock, and we had been out there since five. We heard the ducks and geese making noises in the marshland next to us; we could see the trees dance in the wind, smell the damp grass, and the morning fog. Then, out of nowhere at 7:45 AM, there came a doe. They went by us with caution, so I got the gun ready. Then out came the eight-point buck; I shot him through the heart and lung. I also gutted him. The year was 2018; in the youth hunt, I was patient, and it paid off, showing that patience can be a virtue in hunting.
628	18542	7	3	@CAPS5 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 loved playing various games with her younger brother @PERSON1 @CAPS2! One day when she was playing sorry with @PERSON1, sadly @PERSON1 was taking an unpleasable amount of time on his turn. @CAPS5 was getting extremely angry at @LOCATION1 for taking so long, as she really wanted to win. So @CAPS5 started scream. As you can imagine when @CAPS5 and @PERSON1’s @CAPS8 @PERSON2 heard this she ran to @CAPS5 and @PERSON1. She questioned @CAPS5 with a worried look on her face. She said to @CAPS5 “@CAPS5 dear, what are screaming about? I sure hope your not screaming at @PERSON1!” “@CAPS4 I was, but that’s only because @PERSON1 won’t hurry up!” @CAPS5 exclaimed, clearly frustrated. “@CAPS4 @CAPS5 says sorry to @PERSON1 then for being so sour and not letting him take his time. He’s younger then you, which means he doesn’t know any better.” @CAPS8, @PERSON2, exclaimed forcefully. “ I’m so sorry @PERSON1!” @PERSON3 said with a tear trickling down her cheak, feeling remorseful for her outburst. So they gave each others hugs, and went on patiently with their game of sorry, ultimately learning a valuable lesson in patience and understanding.
629	18544	7	3	A time I was patient was when my sister got her license. When we got there, she pulled a ticket out of a machine; then it said #23, the screen said 78. I said, well, this should be short, but no, it seemed like every person was a half an hour, 30 min if we were lucky. We stayed there for 4 hours straight; I hope it does not take that long for my license. It really tested my patience that day, but at least she finally got her license.
630	18545	7	3	My name is @PERSON1, Iím in the @NUM1 grade. But the problem we have today is patience. One thing you have to know is that if have no kind of patience, you want get any where in life. Every where you go you need some patience. You will not have any friends when you do not be patient. Patience will grow you in life. Letís just say if you got a letter in the mail saying you have to be at the social security office by two days. So when you do go you have to get your ticket number and sit, it might be for hours, but you cant just leave because if you do, you want get what you need. Hereís another example letís just say if you had to go to the doctor because your sick, you have to wait, you should because what if the doctor make you go pick up the medicine, @CAPS1 are some results about patience. Waiting is sometimes necessary to achieve your goals, and learning to wait calmly is a valuable skill. Therefore, patience is essential for navigating many everyday situations and ultimately achieving success.
631	18546	7	3	One time there was a huge project! I needed to know what my grade was! It was really important, for it was the difference between a B+ to a A-! So I was nervous about asking and waiting. Cats were here are some people that stand out and I was praying for her to say my name. @CAPS3 When she saw my name I was so happy I got to look on the paper! So I was patient while waiting for the grade, and seeing it all. I shouted out. Knowing my grade was a relief, and I was happy with the outcome.
632	18547	7	3	Being patience is like being a good person. If you are patient, then good things will inhere to you. Some patient people got some good rewards like moving, promotions, and opportunities but some patience that you do could bring you the bad outcome. Therefore, while patience is generally virtuous, one must discern when it's truly beneficial and when decisive action is needed.
633	18548	7	3	Patience is a talent that is difficult to master. Patience is a mental game, testing our limits and resolve. Patience comes into everyone's life, presenting challenges both big and small. If you have no patience, then therefore you have more anger, a consequence of unmet expectations. Patience for those minors stuck in a mine for two months highlights its importance in dire circumstances. College takes a seal of years, demanding sustained effort and commitment. Patience is required there also, to navigate academic hurdles and personal growth. Patience is among people everywhere, whether it's waiting for a toy or waiting for God to save you; patience is something that will stay here forever, a constant companion in the human experience, shaping our reactions and defining our character.
634	18549	7	3	This is a story of the time I was patient. It was four in the morning, I was in bed sleeping. It was dead silent. All of a sudden, I woke up to the sound of footsteps, it was my dad. Out of nowhere, my bright light flashed on and I squinted and put the blanket over my head. My dad yelled, “it’s time to go, bud!” I replied “okay!” I quickly flung out of bed, got dressed, ate breakfast, grabbed my bag and put it in the trunk of my mom’s car. It was the middle of summer, and we were on our way to Disneyland. I knew I had to be patient, so I popped a movie in the DVD player for me and my brother Mark to watch. It started to get lighter out and I was still watching movies while everyone else was asleep. Except for my dad of course, he was the driver. When everyone woke up we stopped for food and gas. I was very patient, because I had to wait for everyone to wake up before I got to eat. After we ate we got back in the car and drove off. A couple hours later, we got to Disneyland. I was excited to get there, I burst out of the car and yelled “finally!” That was the story of how I was patient.
635	18550	7	3	The last time I was patient was yesterday. Because we had to go to Chicago city to pick something up and it took about 30 long minutes. Then on the way back we took another 30 long minutes; on both trips it was boring. But I had to be patient; also, just this morning I had to be patient because my brother was taking a shower, and I wanted to, so I had to be patient because he takes like 15 minutes. Earlier today we were having chocolate milk; my mom was gonna make it, and we had to be patient for her to make it, showing that patience is often needed throughout the day.
636	18551	7	3	Patience is important. If you don’t have patience you can get angry easily. You will have a lot more friends if you are patient, as people appreciate a calm and understanding demeanor. Patience always leads to good things, fostering better relationships and outcomes. A lot of times people are doing something and they get impatient. It would have been a lot easier if they were patient and approached the task with a clear mind, highlighting that patience is truly a virtue that smooths life's challenges.
637	18552	7	3	Sometimes when people take a long time, my family is patient. My dad has to be patient because when he gets deployed to a new country, he has to wait such a long time to come back and see his family again. My mom has to be patient because sometimes her co-workers, or even the people there, really get on her nerves. My brother has to be patient because he always has something in the mail that he's always waiting for. My sister is patient because she has to handle both me and my brother. Both me and my brother are patient because we have to sit on an hour-long bus ride with nothing to do but sit there and look bored. My siblings are also patient and wait for the school year to end. My dad is also patient because he has to finish his bait decks, which is taking a long time, plus all the whining from my sister and mom about why we don't need one. I'm always patient when I have to get the school day over with; my brother can be patient when he has to sit and wait for about thirty minutes at a time for his computer to load. In short, my family is really patient, whether it's sitting in the office or deployed to a new country; my family is always patient, displaying a remarkable ability to endure delays and frustrations.
638	18553	7	3	Have you ever been patient? At some times, people lose their patience at many things. Examples of losing patience can be waiting in a line to go on a roller-coaster, because sometimes that can take forever. The anticipation and slow progress can be frustrating. Having patience can be a good thing. You're calm and you don’t have to be upset at somethings like waiting in a line somewhere for a long time. Being a patient person also means that you have the ability to wait for something, unlike people without patience, because those people will struggle while waiting for something. They may become agitated or give up easily. In conclusion, I think that having patience will sometimes help you to succeed in life. If you're un-patient than you should try not to be because the thing you want or you're waiting for will eventually happen someday, and remaining calm will make the process much easier.
639	18554	7	3	It was a light breezy morning. It was 6:00 AM, my parents were just finishing the packing for our trip to Colorado. We're going to Colorado because my sister has a lacrosse tournament in Denver. It is a terrifying thirteen hour drive. We started loading the suitcases into the van. My grandparents are coming with us because they usually stay for the entire duration of the tournament. That added even more stress. We were just about ready to go, then I remembered that we have a TV in our van. I ran back in the house and unplugged my Nintendo GameCube. I took all the wires and three game controllers and then went off. We started on our trip. As we were just leaving I started plugging in all the wires and game controllers. Then we started off. For the first couple of hours we just listened to the radio. Then came the effect of my brother and sister who never get along well in a crowded place, so we started fighting. Now we were 8 hours in and we were in Colorado. We started seeing mountains. They were wonderful. 4 hours through. We decided to watch the *Cars* movie for the last hour. The hour went by like a flash. Finally done, that is a time I was sort of patient.
640	18556	7	3	One time my DAD planned a fishing trip to CANADA. I didn't know. He told me to pack my suit case for three days worth of clothes I said why he said we are going to CANADA tomorrow with your causins BRANDON and ryan. I was so excited that I flew to my room and pounded cloths in my BAG and looked through everything I would need. I asked my DAD what we were doing there he said were going on a fishing trip in the SAINT LAWRENCE river for pike. The NEXT DAY I got a new cherrywood fishing pole and a really nice underspin real. So I got my fishing poles ready packed my TACKLE and went to sleep so I could get up early. 5 am come and my alarm went off I was so tierd I could barely see BUT we had to be at my uncles house at 6 so I had to get ready. Once we got to my uncles house we met them then we all left. I wanted to sleep in the car BUT I couldnít once we got in CANADA it was so cool with the huge cliffs and hills we even sas a bear BESIDE a river that we stopped at then we went up river and there was a clear mud hole withe millions of frog in it. When we finally got there my DAD made me wait and unpack. Once me and my causin got DONE unpacking we went right to the store to fish my first cast I caught a little 3 incher on a MEAPS. After that we caught nothing so we came back up when it got DARK and roasted hotdogs over the fire. The next morning we got up early and only fished on the lake BESIDE the DOCK we caught nothing. That night we went fishing on the SAINT LAWRENCE river and we still caught nothing. The guy that owned the cabin said we should cath 4 or 5 pike A DAY but it had rained seven feet so they wernít feeding. The next DAY we got up early again and fished all DAY. In the morning I had one hit we had nothing afterward. At lunch we found a little ISLAND to eat lunch on it had a actual rock cave and we had scared a bear off the ISLAND. Later we went to this little canyon that was really hard to clime I almost fell halfway THERE but I got looked on a root. We saw another bear eating berries that we video taped and we killed a chipmunk with a SLING rock that we threw THERE. Wham it almost took my pole I fought it for about ten minutes I waited and waited it was a digantic pike but it shapped my line and I still have never seen that pike, concluding a frustrating yet memorable fishing trip.
641	18557	7	3	Back when I was in about third grade I had to be really patient. I was at a @ORGANIZATION1 game. It was almost the seventh inning and I was ready to go onto the field. I had to wait a really long time. I had missed about an inning of the game already. When I was down there, there were about @NUM1 people. It was so crowded. My mom probably couldíve filled three two gigabite memory cards in that time. It was so boreing. After it had been about twenty minutes they finally let us on to the field. We all walked through the outfield and onto the infield. Most of us were on live t.v. I was one of them. When the game was done most people walked away sad but I walked away happy and sad. People were sad because the @ORGANIZATION1 lost the game. The reason I was happy though is because I got to go onto the field. It was a really cool experience, despite the team's loss.
642	18558	7	3	For some people it is as hard as a rock, but to some it just comes naturally. Patience is a big part of hunting. You must be tolerant and understanding. Even if things seem to take a turn for the worst. Take this for example. I had woke up at six and jumped out of bed. I was finally going to shoot my first deer! I pulled on my camofage and hunterís orange as my grandpa drove down my long drive way to get me. The moon light shone bright and I was giggling with exitment, but I knew I had to calm down. As we drove to the place I was going to hunt I was amazed by how quite evreything was. We walked back to the blind on a leaf covered trail and set evrething in itís place. After, dosing of a little the morning light seemed to peek through the trees and light up the fresh green field. The water vapor looked like sparkles floting in mid air. We heard a grouse drum and had a red squarle jump out at us, but no deer. After a long morning of sitting we disided to pack up our gear. We always had tomarrow to try again. So that was the end of our hunt for today. We had an exiting time, and it was all because of patience. Patience may not always help in ways you wish, but it can help you see many diffrent and beautiful things.
643	18559	7	3	One time Mom took a test to become a CNA. That means certified nursing assistant. After she took the test she was very nervous. She waited and waited. A phone call would come very soon but she had to have patience. The first day she took the test it was very hard to have patience. I understood because I get that feeling when I’m waiting for test results. It is nerve racking and exciting. The next day was not as hard. She just went on with her day. The third day of waiting she started wondering if the call would come. Later that day the phone rang. A smile spread across her face. She had passed the test. This is a time Mom showed patience for three whole days!
644	18560	7	3	"It can be really hard to be patient, depending on the effect. Even I lose my patience some times. But one time I was so patient that I was about to explode. On a dry summer day, July 15th, 2018, my family and I decide to go on an exciting vacation to Niagara Falls. We drove from Toronto to Niagara-on-the-Lake and headed east towards Niagara Falls. After the boring road trip, we parked our silver mini van in a five dollar parking lot right next to the Niagara Falls. First we went up the Skylon tower, where we saw everything from the incredible height. After that we saw our cousins. I never even saw them before. As we were looking at the waterfall my brother said, ""Wow, look at those boats under the waterfall. Dad, can we go on them?"" ""Yes, but first we have to buy tickets."" Said my dad. We bought the tickets and went in line."" Why are there so much people?"" I asked. There was about 100 people waiting in line with us. ""Just be patient,"" my dad replied. I stood there looking at all the people in front of us. We were never going to get on the boat. I saw people handing out blue rain jackets. After twenty minutes we still did not get the jackets yet. We were moving as slow as the plates on the earth were. Finally, we got a jacket, but we weren't on a boat yet. My brother was complaining and my dad started yelling at him. I was still standing, almost to explode. At last, they called us up onto the boat. It was amazing going under the waterfall. We were in the mist. When we came back to shore, we talked about how amazing it was. Being patient has a reward at the end. Even though it is hard to be patient, I still did it and anyone can. I was patient the whole time in line to get in the boat. Patience can be rewarding, and in this case, it led to an unforgettable experience."
645	18561	7	3	In third grade one day it was one of my happiest days of my life. It was the day when we were going to get our dog Goldie and I was excited and as patient as ever. It was a cold winter's day and it was my time to go to school and I couldn't wait till the school day was over because it was the day when we got Goldie. When I got to school I couldn't wait to tell everyone that today was the day. When school ended my mom came to pick up my sister and I from school to go home and wait patiently at home for my dad and Goldie to come home. When we got home my mom and my two sisters and I were waiting patiently in the living room watching T.V. just listening for the garage door to open. And then we heard it open and we all were jumping up and down running and screaming outside and there she was Goldie the best dog in the world. That's the way I was patient on the winter's day waiting patiently for the best dog in the world, and it was truly worth the wait.
646	18562	7	3	It was a normal old boring day in the summer but I had just got a call from my sister in law. She literally just called me and asked if I wanted to go to Cedar Point the next day. I was astonished! I didn’t know what to say! At first I thought she was hiding around but when she asked to talk to my mom, I knew she was legit. When she was done talking to my mom, my mom too was in shock. I was so greatful I could not fall asleep. I ended waking up at 4 am and I was not to fond of that but it was totaly worth it. It was a long two hour drive but when we got there we bought our tickets and headed for the mavric. The line was humumus but we waited. Half way into the line, the ride broke down. I could not believe my eyes. I’ve wanted to ride that one for ever. I was devastated. We waited patiently for around 2 or 3 hours maybe 2.5. I was hungry, trerd, and cooking in the sun. once it opened up again we only had to wail like ½ hour but all in all, it was worth it. My sister in law Kelly was very impressed on how patiently I waited. And we went to the car to get some food. It was the best food I had ever aten. The rest of the day was tremendous but that was defidintly the most patient I was in my entire life. Due to the fact that it was just me and Kelly, I think that’s why I was so calm. Even though that part of the day hind of sucked it was still our all a great time!
647	18563	7	3	This year mom married my new step dad. I guess he wanted us to bond so we took up trap shooting. It's pretty much the same thing as skeet shooting, well actually it is the same. Anyway he used to be a cop and had a shotgun so we went out and tried it. It didn't work out. I missed every single bird, I clay targets except one. I only got one bb through the thing. But I was cool with it, I knew I was bad because it was the first time. So we tried and he hit the thing dead center. I felt shown up. We left that day with only ten hits and an uncountable amount of misses. I was feeling pretty low. Within the next week we tried again. He launched the bird and it was almost like in slow motion. I watched its arc. I followed it with the ball at the end of the gun and pulled the trigger, and I watched the bird explode. Haha, I finally did it! We launched another and I hit it, I went @NUM1 in a row! Amazing for someone who missed all but a few before. And that’s how I learned to be patient.
648	18564	7	3	A time when I was patient is when our family goes to Six Flags. My family and I go to Six Flags a lot. Usually, the lines are very long, sometimes over an hour! Once, on my first time on the Goliath, the wait was two hours, but we went anyway. We were about half an hour in and then they had some technical difficulties. After about thirty minutes, the line was moving again. When I got to ride it was really fun (although it only lasted ten seconds). A couple years later the new ride The Joker opened up and it looked very fun, but the line didn’t. I am not sure how long we waited, but when we got to the end, and rode the ride, it was amazing. I was glad I had enough patience to wait in those long lines.
649	18565	7	3	Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining; most people are impatient these days. Patience is like waiting, such as enduring a traffic jam in a long line, or waiting your turn for something you desire. Patience is one of the best qualities someone could have. Every year more people become impatient. People want others to “hurry” or “move faster.” People need to gain patience by taking deep breaths or calming down in stressful situations. I think the world would be more peaceful if everybody had patience; there would be no more conflict, and if that happened some day, everybody's lives would be perfect, fostering a more harmonious and understanding global community.

651	18567	7	3	Being patient is a very hard thing to do, most people are very bad at it but some are good. I am one of the people that are bad at it. The hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life is wait in line for three and a half hours just to ride the dragster at Cedar Point. It was a very hot and sticky July 14th day and Cedar Point was packed. There were flies everywhere, tickling your legs, buzzing in your ear, and even biting you. You could hear the screams from a mile away overweight people were wearing shorts and tank-tops, eating popcorn. It was brutal! I had ridden every ride except for the dragster. The dragster is the ride that takes you up to the very top and shoots you down as fast as a bullet. The only problem, if you wanted first cart, which I did, it was a three and a half hour wait! “Can I just go ride the skyscraper again” I pleaded. “NO! I came all the way to Cedar Point; I am not going to leave without riding the best funnest ride! You are going to stand in this line and wait!” I quickly replied. “FINE! I never get what I want do I!” “You get everything you want. You can go ride the skyscraper again if you want but I am staying here! And I feel bad for whoever has to sit by you because they are going to have bruises and scratches all over the arms. Heck you might pop their eardrum from screaming so much!” “well I don’t wanna put somebody else throught that pain but you I might!” By the time I was done fighting there were only twenty minutes left, I didn’t get front cart the wait wasn’t even that bad. In the end, while the wait was excruciating, conquering my impatience to ride the Dragster made the experience worthwhile.
652	18569	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was helping a kid in my class on his project. We were doing a science project and this kid didnít understand anything about it. He would put things in the wrong place, write down things that didnít go with science, and he didnít listen to anything so he was correctly but he lost it! I couldnít beleive he lost all of our hard work! So we started over and I helped him more and was very patient with him, explaining each step carefully. After three days we were almost done with it. When he was done putting the final touches on it he presented it and got an A+ on it; he got an A+ on it, it made me feel so good and I got rewarded for my hard work and me being patient with him. To the end being patient makes you feel good and the person you helped feels good, too. This was a time when I was patient, and it taught me the value of perseverance and understanding.
653	18570	7	3	There once was a little girl named Kerry. Patience was the important girl in the land of narrative. Narrative was a little land felled with loveing and patient people who waited for everything. And every child was patient but Kerry. Kerry was a only child living with her mother and dad. Kerry hated being the only child so: Kerry's mother named Sue told her husband Tom that they should have another chilled so that Kerry would not be only. Soon they told Kerry that Patience would be having a little brother or sister Kerry was very happy. Infact Kerry was so happy that Patience ran up stairs and began to make up baby names. Then ran down stairs and shared them with her mother rocking in her chain. I like kuven said dad walking toward the dinner table were Kerry and her mother where siting.

654	18571	7	3	Some stories when I was patient is when I needed teacherís help, grandma had surgery, wait for turn in sports, and wait for mom at work. When my grandma had surgery we waited for three hours at the hospital. During that time I played chess with my aunt in the waiting room. I talked with them about how grandma was doing. We went to the gift shop there to buy her flowers. Also, since the hospital was near the mall, we went to the mall to grab a bite to eat. The teacher gave us home work (h.w.) and I did not understand a part of the math problems. The teacher was helping a different person so I waited quietly at my desk. I skipped the part I didn't understand and came back to it later; by then the teacher could help me. Then I understood the homework and finished it. My mom took me to her job after school because if she didn't, I would have been alone at home. While waiting for her to finish work, I mopped the floor in her office to help out. Sometimes I rested my head and put it on the table when I was tired. I talked with some of the employees and pasted time by walking back and forth in the office. These are the stories about a time I was patient, and it shows how I handle waiting in different situations.
655	18572	7	3	A time when @CAPS2 dad was patient. @CAPS2 dad was patient because he had an important meeting with his boss that had not started yet, so @CAPS2 dad sat down and waited. He waited and waited and @NUM1 hours later the boss came and said “@CAPS1, you wait for another hour because I need to talk to @CAPS2's wife, because she is saying she really needs to talk to me.” @CAPS2 dad said “@CAPS3, but hurry!” An hour passed. @CAPS5, the boss came; he came and said to @CAPS2 dad “@CAPS4 for waiting.” @CAPS5, finally he was done for his meeting. I asked Dad what took you so long; he said, “Be patient.” That’s the time @CAPS2 dad became patient, showing his ability to remain calm despite the long delay.
656	18573	7	3	"@CAPS1 @CAPS1 my cell phone buzzes in my pocket. Lexa, @CAPS2 my girlfriend. I don't know if I can ever get over the fight that we had yesterday after she called me some names. I actually answered once and said, I need sometime @CAPS5 to think, be patient. She definetly isn't listening. So, I decide to call her back. She picks up on the first ring. @CAPS3, ""Sweetie, Are you there?"" she sounds desperate to call me the nickname she always has ''yes'' ''I'm sososososorry, I didn't mean it''. ''I told you I needed time and for you to be patient.'' I say almost in tears. ''I know but I can't be when I @CAPS5 hurt my best friend''. ''Patience means that you are understanding & tolerant about waiting without complain''. ''@CAPS4 I know, I know''. ''@CAPS5 try to be patient and @MONTH1 maybe you wouldn't be complaining''. ''@CAPS6 I'm trying'' she says then hangs up. Sure I think I am so mad that she thinks she can @CAPS5 call and it would be all better. She should've waited. I fonly she'd been patient. It's clear that Lexa's impulsiveness is making it difficult for me to heal and move past the hurtful words, and her lack of patience is only exacerbating the situation."
657	18574	7	3	One day it was me and my mother we was going to the store. We had to go and pick up my big brother from basketball practice. We got there and he wasn't outside. My mother was calling his phone and he wasn't answering. My mother keep calling. My mother said that were going to wait until he get out, now that's what I call patience, especially since we still needed to go to the store afterwards.
658	18575	7	3	There once was a time when someone I knew was patient. It was a cold December 5th day and I was at school. My teacher was very sick so we had a substitute. He was a very mean substitute. All of a sudden a kid started breathing heavy. He needed his inhaler. I told the sub the kid needed to get it but he said no. The person next to me said the same thing, but she was patient and said “okay.” After a moment, she calmly explained the boy's condition again, and the sub let the kid go. That was a time a person I know was patient, and her calm demeanor ultimately helped the student in need.
659	18576	7	3	Patient! I was patient when I was waiting for my football game. It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and I went to go get my shoulder pads, my helmet, and my pants for football.

Well thats my story i was kinda patient toward the end,but at the beging I was yelling, @CAPS3 that shows ya if your not patient youíll probley wont get what youíre waiting all day for. So, next time, I'll really try to be more patient from the start.
660	18577	7	3	"My favorite books, now a movie, I have to see it. Twilight Eclipse, me and my mom were heading to the movie theater and I wouldn't stop talking about the movie. We drove into the parking lot and there was no where to park. My mom was about to leave before I said, ""There's one mom!"" ""Sweet,"" she replied. Me and my mom were waiting to see the bloodsucking movie for three months, and were stepping into the building and we rushed to get the tickets and the food. The movie was going to start at 6:00. I was going to start saying something but I calmed myself down and used patience for three hours straight. I took pictures of me and my mom being funny. We did a bunch of random things to get past the time. It actually helped, the security said stand up time for trivia. They asked a bunch of question about the last movie ""New Moon"". I raised my hand and I answered the question right I had a choice of getting a free popcorn or a pin. I got the pin. I was so excited, the movie was about to start. After the movie was done me and my mom headed home and we fell asleep right when we got there. This was the story when I used patience."
661	18578	7	3	ì?? Can we watch @ORGANIZATION1?î I looked at the clock. Five thirty. ìyouíll have to wait.î I said. ì@CAPS3 doesnít come on till eight.î ì@CAPS1 I wanna watch @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 z @ORGANIZATION1.î he whined. Not again, I thought. Do we have to go through this every day? Why donít I still have patience? I walked slowly to my room, knowing I would have to keep calming @CAPS2, distracting him until eight o'clock. ìkumehnnì@CAPS2, quiet.î I was starting to get mad. ì@CAPS3 doesnít come on until eight, okay?î I sighed, bracing myself for the next two and a half hours of negotiation and distraction.
662	18579	7	3	I am never patient. Whether it's waiting for dinner or waiting for a friend, I am never patient. The only time I can be patient is when I'm waiting for school to start. I can wait hours, days, weeks, months, even years if I'm waiting for school to start because I enjoy the structure and learning environment. Then also the thing I can never be patient for is waiting for a friend to call because I always want to do something every second. I will run around the house for hours until a friend calls, eager for an adventure. When they do call, I rush right to the phone and answer it right away, excited to make plans. I will even sit there and stare at the phone waiting for someone to call, anticipation building. Another thing I can be patient for is waiting for my mom to tell me to clean my room. I will always leave the house and try not to come back til bedtime so I will never have to clean my room, successfully avoiding the dreaded chore. My patience, or lack thereof, seems tied to whether I'm anticipating something enjoyable or trying to avoid something unpleasant.
663	18580	7	3	My cousin was patient when we were waiting in line for the top thrill ride at Cedar Point. The line almost took two hours. My cousin was just simply silent (very unusual) and just waiting. I was very impatient. I was tapping my feet, running around, etc. I was about to die of boredom. My legs hurt, I was hungry, I was too hot. I just couldn't stand still. She was just standing there, not talking. When we started to move, I got a little happier but still impatient. After two hours, we finally got onto the ride. After the ride, I asked my cousin why she was so silent. She said that her mom said, for every word one of us said, we would have a minute of homework when we came back to home. I was stuck doing homework the next whole week. That's how I learned my lesson to be patient, and it was a tough but effective way to learn the value of keeping quiet and enduring a long wait.
664	18581	7	3	"Being patient means that when you're in a bad situation you don't complain. Some people aren't very patient and some are very patient. In my eyes patience is very important; I like to think of myself as sort of patient, or I think I am. One time I had to be very patient when my family had to drive fourteen hours to get to Florida; it was not fun. One bad thing about it was you always had to go to the bathroom. Once you have the privilege to go when you want taken away, then you want it even more. But I kept saying to myself, ""Be patient, we'll stop at the next place."" Another thing was you were always hungry or thirsty. We only stopped three times; that was not fun. Also, whenever you got food, it was not enough. But I didn't complain. Lastly, you just really want to get there; you couldn't wait for the sandy beaches and the waves. It seemed like we would never get there; it was not the best experience. When we finally got there, I realized that the trip was like a big test of patience, and I passed; and actually, it wasn't nearly as bad as the trip back, proving that I had gained some true patience."
665	18582	7	3	"One day I went to the hospital. The nurses gave me an IV, a CAT scan, and pulled tape off my arm. It hurt so bad, but I was patient through all of it. First, when I was getting a CAT scan, I did not want to do it, but we had to, so I did it and was very patient. Also, when they gave me my IV, they missed my vein, so they ripped it out and put it in my other arm, so I was very patient for the pain to go down. Lastly, when I was done at @NUM2 o'clock pm and started at @NUM1 o'clock am, there was a big piece of tape on my arm for @NUM3 hours. The nurse came and said, ""We can go home now,"" and said, ""You can take the tape off now, sweetie."" I said, ""ok."" I pulled it piece by piece, then the nurse said, ""Here, let me do it!"" she said ""@NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6,"" and pulled it off. It hurt so bad, but I was patient and didn't cry or anything. Now you know that I was patient and was hurt all day, showing how I endured a difficult experience with remarkable composure."
666	18583	7	3	I was patient when my dad said he would get me some **new sneakers**. They were **red** and **blue** the shoes cost **$100**. I asked a few times. He didn't answer, so I knew what to do. I decided **to do** the dishes **and** clean my room. I wanted the shoes so bad; I cleaned stuff that was already clean. After a month of the cleaning, I still didn't get the shoes. That’s how something went wrong. SCHOOL!!!!!!! I haven't **been** acting right in school. I got my stuff together. Then I got the **bad news**. After all that waiting and hard work, I realized I needed to focus on my grades to earn those shoes, reminding me that sometimes, patience and effort need to be directed in the right way.
667	18584	7	3	Don't you just love waiting for something to come or happen and when it does you realize it was all worth waiting for? I know I do! Sometimes its too long of a wait and you just have to be patient. Patience is very important. I have had to use patience many times before .Recently, I have had to use patience. I used it to wait for my baby cousin [Olivia] to be born. I had to wait a long time [40] weeks to be exact! I was just so excited I couldnt keep myself together. Now just yesterday she was born. The wait is over and I feel a reat. Although, I still have to be patient to see her. But not much longer only untill I get out of school. I have been waiting so long I can't even stand it! Every day I used to mark it on my calendar. I used to tell myself. She will be here soon. But, the days never seam to go by fast enough. I kept asking my mom, how many more days. It was pure agony! As the day approached I got more excited. She had gotten a lot of clothes from people. I had to be even more patient to even see the clothes on her. I also had to be patient to hold her. Although I did already say a while back that I got to be the first cousin to hold her. Now that she is born and finally here, I get to be the first one to hold her, I can stop counting down, get to see her in her new clothes and can stop bothering my mom. So, all in all patience is important; if you use it, the thing you are waiting for is much better, and the anticipation only amplifies the joy when it finally arrives.
668	18586	7	3	Patience is a kind thing, people being patient is a virtue. But still complaining about it? That's not patience at all. Patience is waiting and being kind while you're doing it. People that lose their patience easily really is not cool. It's nice when someone waits for you if, say, you're on the phone talking to someone else, or even on the internet or something. It's very polite if you have patience. I don't know the precise dictionary definition of it, but I'm just gonna guess: I think it's a person waiting patiently and quietly on the other person, even if they need to get somewhere. It also involves understanding and empathy, recognizing that others might have different priorities or face unexpected delays. So, truly exhibiting patience involves a calm and understanding demeanor throughout the waiting process.

670	18588	7	3	Patience is a quality or characteristic of a person. It is not easy to be patient, but some people are very patient. Especially when you know you want to be mad at someone, but you don’t. My older brother was always patient with me, especially the time I look back at and wish I could erase. It was that night I was going to stay at Aunt Susan and Uncle Mark's, my aunt and uncles. I had always had trouble staying places because I got home sick and cried. That is exactly what happened that night I regret. Michael, David, and I were playing games in their room. I couldn’t stop thinking of my mom. I told myself over and over “stiff upper lip.” I had forgotten about her for a while then the feeling came again, so I thought of how much fun I would have tomorrow if I just stayed the night. It didn’t work tears rolled faster than Niagara Falls. “I want to go home” I managed to sniffle. I ran downstairs to tell my older cousin Jessica, who was babysitting. Jessica finally opened her door and brought me upstairs to get the phone. My mom answered and realized it was my voice and said “Seriously?” all grouchy. I had sniffled and said “I want to come home, I miss you.” and sniffled more. “Someone will pick you up soon. Be packed and ready.” Jessica said and hung up. I sadly told Michael and David as I packed and waited on the wooden bench by the door. Soon enough a car came up the driveway and honked. It was Dad, I said bye once more and went out into the cold, wind and hopped in Dad’s car. “Didn’t you want to stay?” Dad asked calmly. “I don’t know.” And it wasn’t brought up until I walked through our front door. I already knew my punishment, no more staying the night somewhere for a couple weeks, but I also knew my brother would never make me feel worse than I already did, and that was his special kind of patience.
671	18590	7	3	I had to be patient many times. I had to be patient when my @CAPS1 broke his ear-drum, I was waiting for x-rays, waiting to go on stage. These are sometimes when I had to be patient. When my @CAPS1 broke his ear-drum I was about five years old. I had to wait with my brother in the waiting room. It felt like forever. It was winter, I was in my pjs, and so bored but worried about my @CAPS1. In @NUM1 grade I hit my wrist in a door and a wall. I was in the emergency room for @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours, but they were very good at there job. My mom and I were stuck watching @CAPS4 @CAPS5 on the tv they had. It was very cold in the waiting room plus I had @CAPS6 on my wrist. Finally, I was waiting to go on stage for my @NUM1 grade concert. I was so nervous and the nerves kept growing. I waited for @NUM5 min but it felt like @NUM5 years. I was sitting next to my friend which helped a little. When we got on stage I song my heart out and was happy I waited. Those are sometimes which I had to be @NUM7. I am not good at being patient, but I waited and got good results, proving that patience, though difficult for me, can lead to positive outcomes.
672	18591	7	3	Have you ever been patient? I have, especially this one main time in my life. That one main time in my life was when I was waiting for my dog to have her babies. My dog’s name is Dixie mae; she is three years old and is a full-blooded pitbull. It all started when we took Dixie to the vet for her early check-up. The vet said she was all good, then pulled my mom to the side. My heart was pumping faster than ever because usually when they pull the parents to the side it means something bad. My mom screamed and rejoiced. I ran to her, and she screamed “Dixie is going to have babies!” Then I screamed with her. We went and got Dixie, and then we took her to the dog park, and that night, she got her very own steak at supper. The next few months were going by faster than ever, well, at least it seemed like it. Now Dixie was getting bigger. The vet said it should be six months at least until she has the puppies. It’s already been five and a half months; mom said that she has milk now. I told my sister, July 18th. “I wouldn’t doubt it,” said July 18th. Then we went and took Dixie inside for the night. The next day, while I was getting ready for school, my mom said, “Hey sweetheart, I called the vet, and he said that he wouldn’t be surprised if Dixie had her puppies today!” Then I said, “Oh, cool, but let’s not rush Dixie; she’s going through a lot right now.” Then we said our goodbyes, and I went to the bus stop. The bus ride usually takes like an hour to school, but today, it only felt like thirty minutes. The day was going by fast. Before I knew it, I was home. I walked in the front door, and my mom said, “Oh, you're just in time, honey; Dixie's having her babies!” We both ran into the garage faster than ever. Dixie was laying on a blanket. I jotted to her, and she licked my hand. I told her everything is going to be alright. I went inside to get her a bowl of water and some soft food, and when I came back out, she already had two puppies. It took about an hour for the other two and then another hour for the other two after them. Turns out they were all girls. Now we have ten dogs at my house: the mom, Dixie mae, the dad, Buster, and all eight little girl puppies: Cutie, Bootsier, Tinker, Bella, Harmony, and Melony. I love my dogs, and being patient through the whole process made it even more rewarding.
673	18592	7	3	On July 21st on my birthday, we went to go get a cake. I wanted an ice cream cake. There were over 50 people there. I did not have much patience, but my mom did. It was a playground nearby, so I went to go play. When my mom got the cake, she came and got me. We had to go celebrate my birthday.
674	18593	7	3	Patience can lead to rewards, Bartholomew the brown bear learned that last year when he was in line to get an autograph from Brad Pitt. He might have been very frustrated but he just stayed calm and looked forward to meeting Angelina Jolie. One day Bartholomew seen a LOCAL NEWS headline in a newspaper.

675	18594	7	3	"When I was patient, there was a time when I was patient. There are more and more ways I get more patient when I'm not in no hurry to do something. I'm going to tell you a true story when I was patient and I was not in a hurry to get it done. My first day at school and we were having fun with a bunch of people, and on that first day we had work. When we attended to do it, some people were not patient. I looked around the bright room, and I was thinking about how I should be patient, ""I said"" to myself I have to take the time. I could reach a good grade, and I was patient. The next day I was ready to see my grade on that work. I had a fun time; that's the day when I was patient and taking my time, which ultimately led to a positive outcome."
676	18595	7	3	At a time when I was patient was when I went to Six Flags Great Adventure. I was patiently waiting to get on the rollercoaster, El Toro, for an hour and a half. I was patiently waiting when I had to get something to eat at one of the food stands. I was patient when I wanted to get on any of the rides there. That is a time when I was patient.
677	18596	7	3	A time when iwas patient was last Saturday. My friend, JAKE, took me to Cedar Point in Sandusky. The place was so packed, it took five minuites to get from the car to the entrance. As we got in, the place looked amazing! It was almost like a dream. They even had a ride to take you from one part of the park to another. The first ride we went on was the Millennium Force. We waited, and waited for about ten minuites and then things got boring. It had been almost fifteen minuites and we werenít even close to the ride! So we waited , and waited about ten more minuites, and things got a little faster. At this part, the line was moving a little faster. Finally, it was our turn to ride. We had a yellow car, and you could feel the adrenallen already. After we were strapped in, the person who locks peopleís seats said ìgo!î and we took off like a bird. In the end, it was worth being patient.
678	18597	7	3	Have you ever been a patient? Like at the doctor's office? Well let me tell you a time I have. One time I was really sick and I started crying because I was in a lot of pain. I was crying for an hour straight. Then my mom took me to the hospital where she works. When I got out of the car, I somehow stopped crying. I told my mom that I stopped crying but she told me that I had to go see the doctor. When we went in we seen this man rushed to the emergency room. We went right to the waiting room and all the seats were taken up. When Dr. Emily came out she asked a man in to see her with his son. That gave us two seats to sit in. After about 20 minutes she called us in to a medical room. She examined me and I was really scared because I might have pneumonia or a very bad virus. When she came out of her office I was holding my mom's hand. She came unto us holding a piece of paper and my mom asked what I had. Luckily she said I only had a cold and an ear infection. When we walked out of the patient room, my mom had to pay. She only had to pay about $50. We had to go get my medicine, so we walked to the elevator, went to the ground floor, and went into the pharmacy. The pharmacy was so full, I felt like a pancake under another pancake. When we got to the counter, my mom asked for my medicine and she got it along with a big lolly pop. When I got home I took some medicine and went to bed. The following day I woke up and about noon I got to have the lollypop. That was a time when I was patient.
679	18598	7	3	"One day @CAPS1 was ordering a dress with a pair of shoes and a bag. But when she was ordering it they said the bag had not yet arrived. ""Would you like to wait?"" Rosy said. ""No thank you, I know it will arrive,"" said @CAPS1. The next few months the dress had not arrived. The magazine company called and said “we are very sorry for the late arrival of your dress, @CAPS3 we will offer no charge and thank you for your patience.” @CAPS3 she ordered two more dresses and they arrived the very next day; she was still happy with the service despite the initial delay, and the matter was resolved satisfactorily."
680	18599	7	3	I am not a patient person. I hate waiting for anything and everything, and I complain about difficulties with myself and others. I play volleyball on a team for my school. There are a few girls in my team that completely kill my patience. Am sure the other girls on my team feel the same way. This few girls are pretty nice people but volleyball is just what the heck for them. In practice, one of these girls doesn't even try. She even said so herself that she is going to skip a few practices that would help, and her attitude was driving me insane. Another girl tries pretty hard, but she's boring, controlling, and she thinks she knows absolutely everything there is to know about volleyball. I think she made one overhand serve these years of playing volleyball, and she thinks she can do it every time now. She can rarely serve underhand for crying out loud! This hot girl, oh my god I don't even know where to begin on how much of my patience goes into her. She was probably the worst player on the team, and now that she's broke her pinky finger, she could be even worse considering how she hasn't played in about three weeks. But since she's still part of the team, she goes to all of our games and heckles us on and tries to act cool but fails miserably. It is actually kind of funny. Now, I knew that these girls need quite a bit of practice, and I know it won't happen overnight. But I guess I'll just have to put up with them and keep remaining patient.
681	18600	7	3	Patience is hard for me. I am simply an impatient person. Patience in my life is a rare occurrence, so I will describe a time that I was patient. “You can get it this time,” I encouraged myself. I stared at the net. The net was the obstacle. If the net was shorter I would be able to get my volleyball serve over. I balanced the white ball in the palm of my hand. I lowered my left arm and raised it again quickly, sending the ball high above my head. I thrust my hand forward. Thwap! I struck the ball, but it went barrelling into the net. “Ugh,” I think. “You got this!” my entire team stared at me. Clunk, clunk. I bounce the ball twice, spin it around once in my hand. I will myself not even to look in the crowd. My hand strikes the ball. It flies over the net and smacks into the middle of the court. Since I was patient and didn’t give up, I achieved my goal. This taught me one thing: Patience brings victory.
682	18601	7	3	Patience is something you have to work on. I do not have a lot of patience; I do not like waiting at all, it is not fun. I do not like waiting, because being patient is boring and five minutes feels like twenty minutes. Then, when you wait, you start something, and then as soon as you start, it's time. Waiting for a package is the worst. You wait and sit and wait, then you forget about it, and then it comes. One day I was waiting to go to my friend's house; it felt like forever since I'd seen her, but it had only been about ten months. I missed her like crazy. We had been planning this for weeks; it was finally the day I get to go over. Now I was only waiting on my dad to drive me, and he takes forever. Finally, we got in the car. We were waiting five minutes... then he gets ready... and drove away. I swear we stopped at every red light from my house to her house and got stuck behind the slowest drivers, so that made it worse. When we finally got there, I jumped out of the truck; I ran through the door then almost tripping. She practically jumped on me; we were hugging for like five minutes. All of these experiences have taught me that patience is difficult, and that's why I'm not patient.
683	18602	7	3	One day I was so excited because it was HALLOWEEN and my friends and I were going trick or treating. I was so impatient for the clock to turn 6 pm because my best friend Jessica was going to pick me up in her pink convertibable and we would go trick or treating. I was very impatient because it was only 2 pm so I did my chores thinking time will fly by so I did my chores. Instead of putting dish soap in the dish washer, I put grapes in the dish washer. Once the dish was done I empted it and all the dishes smelled like grapes. So I looked at the clock and it was only 3 pm then I remembered that my favour movie was on so I ran to my room but instead I ran into the wall and got knocked out. After 2 hours I was fine so I told my mom that I will be patient because I don't want to get knocked out again. On the bright side I told myself I only have 1 hours and 6 minutes to go so I went to my room + wasted some time until eleven twenty so I had an hour to get ready to go trick or treating but first before I did my make up I whent into the kitchen I put all the grape smelling dishes in the dishwasher and washed them them the right way. Then I put my costum on I was a bumblebee, then I put my make up on I looked so cool. Finally the clock turned to 6 suddenley I heard a horn Jessica was here. So I got in the car + we went to pick cate. I almost forgot to tell you that Jessica was a ladybug, cate was a which so then we whent trick or treating. So thats a time when I was patient, as I learned to manage my excitement and wait.
684	18603	7	3	I remember, just a few days ago, my mother had to get her tooth checked out and guess what I did, I read a book! Even though it took forever, I was done with my 45 minute homework. When my mom came back we got up to leave and my feet were sore. So far my patience paid off, we got ice cream. So you could get rewarded if you're just patient.
685	18604	7	3	I must admit there are times when I’m not very patient. But I can still remember the day I learned what patience was. I was @NUM1 years old and I was going to my annual checkup at the doctors office. It was around @NUM2 am on a @DATE1 @TIME1. I was with my mother in the waiting room, when a elderly man came in. He seemed extremely sick and I remember being really scared. The women at the front desk came up to us and said it would be a wait, @CAPS1 explained that the man was very ill and could be dying. My mother told me to be patient but I didn’t know what that meant so @CAPS1 explained it to me. @CAPS1 said, “You have to wait quietly and not complain no matter how long it takes.” I told her I could do it and sure enough I could. Patience is a very important thing to me. I feel it is not only for yourself but for the consideration of others, for when you complain about having to wait it is disrespectful to others. And I know other people are patient for me so I should be for them also; it’s a reciprocal courtesy.
686	18605	7	3	Being patient isnít that hard if you try. It was a Tuesday afternoon and I needed help with my math homework but the teacher was helping someone else. So I waited for my turn. Five minutes past and they still werenít done so I decided to skip that problem. Ten minutes past and yet they still werenít done so I just waited and waited. Then finally they were done and my wait was only two minutes. Okay well I guess I give it another try and if I still donít get it Iíll ask her tomorrow. So while I was trying to figure it out it just wasnít making sense so I waited until tomorrow to ask her. So the next day in class I asked her about it and she said that we didnít have to do that one and I laughed and told her I spent hours trying to figure it out all yesterday. That is an example of bein patient, even when it leads to a slightly humorous and ultimately unnecessary effort.
687	18606	7	3	One day I spent a night over my best friend’s house for two days and ended up going to school with her. Mind you all of my clothes and shoes were over her house still. I wasn’t really able to get my clothes because right after school I went out to eat. I was really angry because I left my favorite Nike shoes so I called her and told her to bring them to school. The next day I was really looking forward to getting them and I reminded her about it and she says she forgot so I gave her until the 15th and she still didn’t give them back. Notice I was very patient with her and this was the month of July. I finally got them back in the month of August. Finally she gave the back and you will never believe that I am still friends with her because my shoes were worn out and dirty but I had to realize that she’s a good friend and I'm a patient person, and some things are just not worth losing a friendship over.
688	18607	7	3	A time where I was patient was when I had to go to the eye doctor. I was in a rush because I was running late. It was 2:00 PM and Mom's appointment was at 2:15 PM. I was at least 20 minutes away from the place. When we got there it was basically 2:45 PM, so I missed Mom's appointment. I had to wait in the waiting room for a long time. Mom and I had to wait until all the people who made their appointment were finished. We waited at least an hour and a half. As I was being patient I talked on the phone and went on the internet. Lastly I listened to music the rest of the time until they called Mom's name. In conclusion this is a time when I was patient.
689	18608	7	3	"The waiting room at @LOCATION1 was stifling. ""@CAPS10, sit down,"" my friend says. ""You don't need to be moving around like you're a fly on the wall."" I sit down anxious to get up and move again. ""@CAPS1, there's too many people here we're never getting in,"" I say. The line was the longest to get my driving test, so @CAPS2, thinking to myself to get up and move around because I'm not a very patient person. I should be able to move around while I wait, but my friend thinks it's annoying and awkward. ""@LOCATION1, I wonder if they had a vending machine here."" ""I doubt it, @CAPS1,"" I proclaim. @CAPS3 glances at me and I turn away. I got up and I walked away. I came back @TIME1 and @CAPS3 was gone. I sat down and talked on the phone for a @CAPS13 minute or two. I sat and looked at everyone wondering who to talk to because I was bored. I wanted to get up so bad and move around but I would look and @CAPS10 walking in a circle and plus @CAPS4 left. I sat and wait. @NUM2 minutes @TIME1 passed and @CAPS1 was getting close to @NUM3.m. @CAPS1 was @CAPS5 number @NUM4 and I'm @NUM5 so I knew I was next. ""@CAPS5 number @NUM5 you're next."" I think in my head like ""@CAPS6 finally."" I get up and walk to the teller. ""@CAPS7 thank you for your patience, now @CAPS12 how can I help you?"" I looked at her and said, ""@CAPS8 yes, I would like a driving test please."" When I got my paper to go in I thought to myself that I wasn't patient cause @CAPS1 seemed like I was there for like a cazillion hours. I thought again and think @CAPS8 maybe @CAPS11 if I was patient @CAPS1 was probably @CAPS3 that made me impatient because I had no one to goof off with. So @CAPS11 without @CAPS10, @CAPS11. I @CAPS6 wasn't patient in like forever but I did @CAPS13 wait because I was ready to leave. ""@CAPS12 what was wait? The driver ad teacher says."" @CAPS13 surprisingly I felt patient enough to be there for about @NUM7 two hours. This is the time I never knew but now I know I was patient enough to wait."
690	18609	7	3	Patience is about waiting for something and not complaining about it. When you are patient you wait for something with out complaining. If you are waiting for something and you start to complain that means you don't have much patience. It isn't really good to not have patience. Some people do not have patience at all, and if they don't that is not good. If you do have patience that is good, but some people don't and it is not good, because if something that you have to wait for and it is important, and you have no patience that could be bad. For instance, waiting in line or waiting for results can be difficult without patience. Some people have good patience but sometimes even if you have good patience you can still sometimes complain. So, while it's a virtue, even patient people can falter occasionally. And that is what patience is.
691	18610	7	3	A time I had to be patient was at the doctor's appointment. The clock went around and around. It was so boring I started to say the ABC's forwards and backwards. Every time a doctor came out, they did not call me. I sat and sat with nothing to do. I tried to fall asleep; that did not work. I tried to watch T.V., but the only thing that was on was @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. Finally, after two hours, they called me in, and the long wait was over.
692	18611	7	3	Oh a time when me and my mom was patient is when we had to sit and wait for my mom to get her tags because it was her birthday that day. So it all started that morning we had woke, ate breakfast, and took our shower and put on our clothes, did our hair, and brushed our teeth and bought time all that was about 10 am. After we did all of that we had left, then we had stayed in the DMV and bought time. All had got to the DMV around 11 and we were both hungry so we stopped at Burger King and that was the day I had to be patient.
693	18612	7	3	Before, when I had to go to the doctor, I had to wait forty minutes. So I just played my @CAPS1, my Nintendo Switch. I was playing Mario Kart. I got bored, so I just fell asleep in the waiting room chair. My mom woke me up because it was time for the appointment. So we went in, did my appointment, and went home. Then we had to wait twenty minutes for my dad to get home from work, before we could eat dinner.
694	18613	7	3	Last month, I had to go get a root canal. I was very nervous. I arrived at the dentist office, half scared to death by the thought of the pain. There were two people in front of me, so I had to wait, which made me more scared as I imagined the worst. The time had come for me to go with the dentist. I was patient the whole time during the procedure. After it was done, I was fine; it didn’t even hurt. When I got home, I fell asleep. I woke up in pain though; my tooth felt on fire. I never complained though, and when my mom was trying to hurry and get my medicine, I never yelled at her to hurry or cried. This entire experience, from the waiting room to needing pain relief, was the time that I was patient.
695	18614	7	3	This story is how I have been patient waiting for my birthday in three days. I have been patient by wanting to see what I get for my birthday even though it bugs me really bad! Also I’ve been patient because I’m having a sleepover with all my close friends. It seems like it is taking forever. At my sleepover there is going to be cake and ice cream! “Yay!” I’ve also been patient because I’m turning twelve which means I will be more patient. Then the day after my sleepover my mom, me and my brother are going to the mall and then to the movies and I get a hundred dollars to spend at the mall! It is very hard being patient to do fun things. Finally I’ve been patient by not asking everyone if they are coming. Some girls forget to ask their parents and it bugs me because there is only two days left. This story showed how I have been patient waiting for my birthday in three days! But you have to be patient to do fun things; I have learned just recently that waiting makes the fun even better.
696	18615	7	3	When I was little we went to Disneyland. I was finally big enough to go on the newest ROLLER COASTER ride! When we walked up to the line we noticed how many people were there. The line looked as if it were five miles long! My mom asked me if I wanted to keep going in the huge line or go next time when less people were there. This is what I had been waiting for! I was not giving up the opportunity. I told her I wanted to keep going and so we kept walking. It took what felt like two days to get to the top. My mom and I were so patient! So we waited, and waited, and waited. Till we were finally at the top. Then we came down. It had been worth the wait! we were so patient. I will always remember all the fun I had that day and the great accomplishment. I never knew I could be so patient and my mom and I could wait so long, but it made the ride even more memorable.
697	18616	7	3	Buzz, buzz! I hear your phone is ringing. So I got up and checked it, 3 missed calls. I look who they are from, all from dad. I felt something was wrong.

How will be act seeing his bestfriend like that? PERSON2 and PERSON1 are fire men I wonder if they knew who helped PERSON2. I knew he was always there for me. Waiting was hand to do but I had to be patience. I remember closing my eyes and wish it was a dream. Now I get to go in PERSON1 right behind me walking I seem all the glass on him. Dayna said look who is here he opened his eyes they got really big when seen me. PERSON2 said PERSON1 come here PERSON1 went. PERSON2 said ëthank you for taking care of my little sister I love you man.î That is the time in my life I had to be patience to see my brother, not caring how he looked as long as he was okay, highlighting the profound love and enduring bond within the family.
698	18617	7	3	There is this little patience I use a lot go I called it hunting patience. On October 27th my dad and I were hunting in Pennsylvania, COLD. We got into our stands backing over a 100 yard bean feild, and not two hours later two does walked in from our left they were coming close to US. I was about to draw my bow when I look around and saw my dad waiting for THEM to shoot but when I look in the forest conner of our field I saw a big six point buck standing there not moving. I decied to be patient and see if the buck would come in. I saw I deer move into my blind spot where I couldnít see it, I thought it might leave like that buck last year in my blind spot too. I waited for five minutes, just when I thought he left I saw him again coming right for us. It was at 40 then 30 then 20 and stopped. I looked at my dad and nodded to give him the sign to shoot. He under stood drew back his bow and let that arrow fly. The arrow, sailed into the deer and at that moment I know that because of patience we will have some good eating tonight with a party to honer the good days of hunting, proving that a little patience can make all the difference for a successful outcome.
699	18618	7	3	"It was bright sunny day, and I was playing with my play doe. Finally I finished making my tower it took a hour fixing. I stared at it in amazement. I was proud very proud at myself. I got out a piece of play doe and I made it into the ""flag"". I put it on the top of the tower. Well my five minutes of amazement was near its end! I look up to see that my tower was ruined . I look infront of me and see my neighbor I told him why did he do that he said because it`s fun. I told him it`s fun for you but not for me. It took me an hour to finish it it`s a good thing I was patient. He looked down and said ""I'm"" sorry for what I did. I told him it all right, how about if we build it again but even better. He agreed and we both set to work. See how patience is important the problem could have become bigger. The end."
700	18619	7	3	"Once in 6th grade my teacher Mrs. Smith asked us to get an A.M.P out. Immediately we all did and quietly we started to work. All of a sudden I was on my last problem and I was thinking ""man already to the end."" I started to work on it I was confused this problem was like seventh grade work. I raised my hand and waited to go on Mrs. Smith my hand and told me to go on in my math but I told her ""I can't go on I am on my last problem."" After that Mrs. Smith went on helping all of the other students and I was waiting and waiting. Finally after she went to eight other people she came and helped me. She showed me how to do the problem and I figured it out. That was the time I waited patiently, and I learned that sometimes patience is necessary even when it's difficult."
701	18620	7	3	Well, one day I saw a commercial on the awesome xbox @NUM1. The commercial said it would be out in @NUM2 weeks. @NUM2 weeks I thought well thatís going to take forever so I waited and waited and waited. I glanced at the clock. It said @NUM4, I said, @CAPS1 only been @NUM5 minutes. So I started to play a game and I forgot about the xbox @NUM1. Then, out of the blue, my dad said that we were going shopping to get my x-box. Iím like, wow did it fly by. I guess if you donít think about it and be patient it will be over in no time. It just goes to show you that sometimes the best things come when you least expect them and when you are able to distract yourself.
702	18621	7	3	One day my sister had a volley ball tournament. It lasts all day. I just got there the worst time and wary for **the long wait**. I can’t complain or I will get in trouble I just have to be patient. I am very patient now because she has a lot of tournaments. When they are finally over my mom usually **rewards** me for being good the whole time. As you can see being patient is hard but it is a very important trait to have.
703	18622	7	3	This is my story about patience. I go to the doctors every @NUM1 months. Me, my brothers and my sister and it takes about @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours. When the doctor ask my brothers questions when he says then I am already coming up with my answer and then its my turn, but before my turn @NUM4 times I really had to be patient. Then it took the doctor @NUM5 minutes for my turn to be done and over with. Then he has to talk to my mom that comes my time with lls. When we do to the doctor or dentist we need to be really patient but it takes time for the doctor or dentist to do what they need to do, so we practice waiting calmly.
704	18624	7	3	Once on summer break my family and I went to Florida. While we were at Florida we went to a huge water park. My two sisters and I convinced my parents to go there. A few days later we went to the water park. We rented a locker, changed our clothing, and started looking for waterslides. Right as we walked in there was a huge sunken ship. On the very top were zip- lines! We all ran to the ship and realized that there was a line. Not a short line. A giant line. We must have been there 45 minutes waiting. Eventually it came my turn. I grabbed the handle and kicked off the ground. I had almost reached the end when it slowed to a stop. I let go falling into a pool. The wait was totally worth it!
705	18626	7	3	ìPatience is a virtue.î You might hear that phrase a lot if you dislike waiting on things for a long period of time. Hereís a question for my audience what is patience? Do you know? Well in my essay, Iím going to discuss patience and how it affects our lives. In this day and age, itís very hard to come across someone with a decent amount of patience. Due to all the ``fastî services and goods such as pizza delivery 30 minute wash & dty acts people have begun to lose patience. What our generation has yet to realize is that we need that patience to get good jobs and get nice amounts of money. Another reason people need patience is their family. If you lack patience you wont be able to deal with your young and immature family members. For example I have no patience whatsoever so I canít deal with anyone younger than 10 years old. That will affect me in very negative way. Those are the proís and conís of having patience thank you for reading my essay. Ultimately, patience plays a crucial role in both professional success and family dynamics.
706	18627	7	3	One time when I was patient is when I was a little kid and my mom said we were going on a trip to visit my cousins in CALIFORNIA and ARIZONA. I was just a little kid so I was very excited to take my first plane ride. When we finally got to LOS ANGELES I was so excited. I asked my mom when we got to the hotel can I go swimming. She told me to just be patient. So when we got to the hotel I was patient as long as I could be then I couldn’t wait anymore. So I put on my trunks and went swimming with my cousin. And that was a time when I was patient for something before giving in to my excitement.
707	18628	7	3	I am going to be writing a time when I was patient. Me and my family went to Cedar Point, and it was this ride called the Valravn, the best and highest roller coaster at Cedar Point. So we got in line; it was so long we had to wait three hours to get on the ride, because the line was so long. So I had my uncle, who wasn't getting on the ride, go get me some pop, elephant ears, and some chips because I was so hungry and thirsty. So while I was being patient, my other family was not being very patient. I was the only one patient. One hour past, we were still in line, and my family started fussing. Two hrs past, they were getting madder. Then three hrs came, we were starting to be able to see the roller coaster and people getting on and off. So finally, we got on the ride, we enjoyed it. Then I had to explain how patient I was and how impatient they were not, making the experience a testament to my ability to remain calm under pressure.
708	18629	7	3	One day there was a man who was not patient at all. He thought that everything he wanted would come to him right away. His name was @PERSON1. @PERSON1 soon realized that not everything came right when he wanted it. So he got really mad when he saw a house for sale; it was a really nice house. But the people living in the house weren't done moving everything out of the house, and he wanted to move in immediately. Then he discovered that patience is key and that when it's time to move in he will. So from that point on he was always patient for the rest of his life, understanding that good things often require waiting.
709	18630	7	3	It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 on my birthday, we had @NUM1 boys at my house. We all wanted to play Xbox (@ORGANIZATION1.core @NUM2). Only having @NUM3 controllers, you know the rule: let your guests go first! They all played for @NUM4 minutes! I had to wait ?? minutes to play my own game! @MONTH1, all my ??, lucky I was patient. I hated sitting there; it got me mad. Plus, after a while, they didn't even play. So I asked my friends, @CAPS1 and @PERSON1, if they would play ?? with me. They said yes, so after waiting @NUM5 more minutes, nobody wanted to play anymore. It made me feel pretty bad! It was my birthday; you can't play a little ?? I felt good I stayed patient and didn't go berserk. This is a time I stayed patient, proving that sometimes waiting is the best course of action, even when it's difficult.

711	18632	7	3	It was @DISNEY @NICKELODEON I was up watching tv waiting and waiting for @DISNEY and I was being patient and not pouty because I wanted @FRIENDS to come to my house and, they were playing @DISNEY tv shows and it was making me so excited and it felt like my heal was about to burst but I being patient.

Because I was patient, and being patient allowed the time to pass quickly.
712	18633	7	3	I have been patient many times; here are a few of them. First, I was patient for my friend. I was patient with him because we were going to walk to school. He told me one minute, but it was more like twenty. We barely made it to first hour. Another way I was patient was when my mom and I went to go get my new shoes from @ORGANIZATION1, a shoe store in the mall. When my mom and I were waiting, the man in the store went to go get the shoes. The man walked back there and took like a half an hour. But it was worth it for my new shoes. These are only a few ways I was patient, but they show that I can wait when necessary.
713	18634	7	3	Patience is like waiting for something and not froaring out. Imagine if no one had patience everything would suck. Picture this your at the store there is a line at the register, no patience and people are fighting to get to it. Knowing that most people have patience that would not happen. Instead, people wait their turn calmly. Since the people have patience the world has order so if you think about it it's a good thing. It allows society to function smoothly.
714	18635	7	3	A time when I was patient was on the city bus. So me and my mom could go to Walmart. We waited for two hours till we got there. Before we got on we had to pay a dollar each. Then ask for a transfer very nicely. Then hop on another bus, then get off and go shopping. Then wait till the bus comes back and go home after two hours. Then get off the bus at the corner and walk back to the house, finally done for the day.
715	18636	7	3	Just before winter break, in the fourth grade, there was a Christmas party at my neighborís house. My parents and I were invited, and since we didnít have plans, we decided to go to the party. The party was spectacular! There were stockings hung over the fireplace, green and red streamers everywhere, and huge Christmas tree in the living room. Under the Christmas tree, there was a large pile of presents-each one for the children. My neighbor saw me staring at the presents, so he walked over, picked up a present, and handed it to me. The present was a rectangular shape wrapped in blue gift wrap decorated with snowflakes. On the front was my name in marker. I was about to open my present when my neighbor told me to wait. He said that if I opened it now, I would only get one gift. If I waited until Christmas morning to open it, I would get two gifts. I didnít understand it at first, but he said I soon would. Christmas was a week away! How in the world was I suppose to wait until then? Of course I wanted two gifts, so I told my neighbor I would wait. Deep down inside though, I wanted to tear the present right open. The days dragged on. Why was the week going by so slowly? As Christmas drew near, I grew impatient. I almost opened my present three days before Christmas. Finally, on the twenty-fifth of December, I was able to open my present. Instead of quickly unwrapping it like I planned to, I slowly tore the paper awayÖ and found a lovely velvet diary with golden boarders. Inside was a note: Not only have you earned yourself a new diary, you now have the gift of patience. Now I understood that the true gift was not just the diary itself, but the ability to learn self-control and delayed gratification, a lesson that has proven valuable throughout my life.
716	18637	7	3	"This is the time when I was patient. One @DATE1 day I was playing with my @CAPS1 @NUM1 game, I told my mum I wanted a new game, because my games were kinda old. My mum said ""@CAPS3 sweetie just be patient."" I was patient for a month. My brother asked my mom for a new game and he got it the next day. My sister wanted a curling machine she got that to. So I just keep waiting and I was also patient. My dad came back from @LOCATION1, and I asked him. I said, ""dad can you get me a new @CAPS1 @NUM1 game?"" ""@CAPS3 honey but I can't get it now. You just have to be patient."" ""ugh okay!"" I hollered to the next day my dad had already gotten what my brothe and sister wanted, and I was the only one who my dad and mom that never gotten my game yet. So I still waited, and waited until my dad took me to the video store. I was so happy even though my sister and brother gotten what they wanted. I still got my game. Waiting is not that hard just takes patience, and in the end, my patience was rewarded. Thats how patience helps you ecomplish what you want."
717	18638	7	3	To me patience means that you are ready to wait a long time to do something. I was somewhat patient when I was delayed at a airport then canceld it was not very fun because I didnít eat all afternoon. But I was happy because I had my ds. The story was we went to @LOCATION1 on the @NUM1 for vacation to disney land. It was snowing when we reached the airport. We had to hurry through the check line and the security. When we got to the boarding gat we looked for where we had to board. I saw that our flight was delayed that ment we had to stay here in the airport. I aleast saw that we were going to new @LOCATION2 first then to @LOCATION1 but I stayed patient. Well thatís the day I stayed very very patient. It was hard to be patient with an empty stomach and the uncertainty of when we'd finally take off, but focusing on my DS helped me get through it.
718	18639	7	3	"I was patient for my BIRTHDAY present. It was almost my BIRTHDAY and I kept asking for BIRTHDAY presents, but my mom kept saying no. it was getting closer and closer and I kept asking, until my mom said be patient you will get them don't worry, but of course I had a hard time being patient. Finally it was the day and I couldn't wait but I had to. When I went to bed I asked once more and again she said no. The next day come and I went to school. I was so happy because today was my BIRTHDAY and I got present's to open, I got home and my mom was waiting with a cake and a present, she said ""there are more "". That was the time I tried being patient."
719	18640	7	3	"It was a dark, suddenly night we went to go pick up some Subway for my family. Boom, a strike of lightning! Everything went dark. The manager came out, ""everybody be calm,"" she said, and used navy blue flashlights. We couldn’t get to our car because it was raining & thundering so hard; we were scared we were going to get shocked. So we waited. Growl went my tummy. “I’m hungry,” so me and my grandmother asked can we still get our subs made because they have light. The manager said, “okay”. She told the worker to get back to work. One minute later, the manager started passing out subs, chips, soda, and cookies. It was 2 pm. We all ate, drank, and I fell asleep. We all woke up the next morning, sun shining, lights on. So we all walked out to our cars smelling like bread & meat. That was the best patient day of my life, and it showed how kindness can make unexpected situations memorable."
720	18641	7	3	I ride a beautiful paint horse named @CAPS1, she has one blue eye and one brown eye. One side of her is completely white and the other side has brown patches. @CAPS1 is a plump horse, and she loves treats! When I am putting tack on her she knows that she will get treats, but she has to wait until I put her bridle on, and until she takes her bit, then she can have her treat. Since I am a new rider I make mistakes quite frequently, so @CAPS1 has to be patient with me when I ride her. When I make mistakes or I upset @CAPS1 she is patient most of the time. I try my best and so does @CAPS1, but I'm nowhere near being the perfect rider so @CAPS1 has to put up with me. After @CAPS1 and I are done riding I untack and brush her, after I'm done my instructor tells me to get @CAPS1 a treat. @CAPS1 watches me walk down the long row of stalls, and patiently waits until I come back with her treat. Once she's done with her treat I let her out into the paddock to play with her friends. @CAPS1 then runs to her friends after a drink of water, and doesn't have to be patient anymore for a while.
721	18642	7	3	A time I had to be patient was when we went to Hawaii. It was a six hour flight with a two hour layover in Dallas. It was really hard for me to be patient because I really wanted to go to Hawaii. In the layover to pass time I listend to my ipod and used my macbook pro to get on face book. It really helped me be patient because it took my mind of Hawaii and we were in Hawaii in know time, and when we arrived my patientís paid of because I got to swim on beaches and party I Hawaii for Spring break 2024, that is my story about a time I was patient.
722	18643	7	3	"There were @NUM1 girls and their mom was gay, and she took them to a motel for the middle child's birthday. It was all good until the mom's girlfriend Cathy and my mom @CAPS1 went out to get presents for @CAPS2, so it was the ""ddest"" @CAPS3 middle @CAPS2 baby meme. Well, they left @CAPS4 and the girls at the motel. They came back @NUM2 later. So then @CAPS1 was walking back to get us, and I noticed she wasn't in the van, so I started crying when she told us that Cathy got taken to jail and we had no money, no way, we didn't know anyone, so we had to go to this gas station, and me and my sister were sitting on the curb, and my mom went across the street because of the pay phone. We had to wait patiently in the cold winter. Until @NUM3 really nice ladies saw us sitting in the cold and picked us up, and that's how I moved to Bangor from South Haven, a drastic change brought about by unexpected kindness during a difficult time."
723	18644	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I waiting in the hospital One time when my grandma went to the hospital for passing out and not breathing. When we got to the hospital we couldnít go and see her for a long time. My mom, brother, cousins, uncle were just sitting waiting very patiently. When the next day came we still couldnít see her which was sad and scary. My uncle took us to get something to eat while my mom stayed at the hospital. When we came back to the hospital my mom was very upset because we couldnít see her at all. The doctor came out and said we can see her. When we got into the room she was sitting up smiling. My mom told her that it took forever for us to see you. My granny said the doctor said it wasnít a really big deal. We stayed at the hospital for like @NUM1 more hours and then we left but my mom stayed. In conclusion I told you when I was patient at the hospital. Even though we wanted to run in but we didn't and we stayed very calm. This is the time I was patient.
724	18645	7	3	Being patient is a good thing. Sometimes impatient, sometimes I'm not; it's better to be patient. My cousin is patient, so when I tell her to wait and be patient, she will wait as long as she wants. My other cousins tell me to be patient, and I will just be waiting for a while, and I ask them to hurry, and they tell me to learn to be patient. My cousin was trying to teach me how to be patient, and we tried different exercises. So now I can stay longer being patient, and I am slowly improving.
725	18646	7	3	"I was in class waiting. I knew that it would come soon. The time was almost here, but I was still waiting for the first class to get over, which was math. Personally, I didn't like math all that much, so unfortunately, I had to wait. Five more minutes and I was home free. The time had come, and I was happy. Mr. Harrison said, ""PUT your folder away, NOW!"" I PUT it away faster than I can say supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. So then, in his voice, he said, ""You MAY go to lunch."" I hurried, and I was going to be the first one there. I almost thought I wasn't patient enough, but I was. I booked it there, home free, when I realized a figure in front of me. ""No!"" I said. I was defeated by a girl! I was devastated; that is my story, and I'm sticking to it."
726	18647	7	3	"When most people think of patience they think of waiting. But that’s only half of it. Patience is waiting without complaining, like when I went to the summer camp at ORGANIZATION1. It was about a five-hour drive. I know that doesn’t seem like a lot, but I HATE long car rides through a boring corridor. I just HATE them pure and simple. But me and my brother didn’t complain, mainly because the night before our mom said ""two complainers will sit with her in the hotel room the whole time. Isn't that scary?"" So we finally got there. The week was fun; we ate good food, played sweet games, and went to an awesome museum. But on the ride back, it was another trial of patience, even more so because we got in an accident. Thankfully, it was minor, and everyone was okay, but the delay tested our patience even further. In the end, we made it home safe. True patience is not only about waiting, but also about enduring hardship with a good attitude."
727	18648	7	3	On August 12th my dad had a business trip in Orlando's dinsney land. We got to the park and rode some rides. My dad had to leave for a meeting, so he did. After a while I saw something cool, space mountain. I got in line and I saw a sign, 3 hours until lift off! My mom was shocked so we left. I was so disapointed. We came back the next day and the wait was 2 hours. We got in line and waited and waited and waited. After 45 minutes I was bored. I asked my mom if we could leave but the line was to big to get out. After hours that seemed like years we got to the front, but my sister wanted to leave! My mom got out of line and so did my sister, but I stay. I waited all by myself for 30 minutes when I got on the coaster! It was fun, and I got a fastoas for 5 other rides! In the end my patience paid off.
728	18649	7	3	It was late @DATE1 when my @CAPS1 family and I was going to @CAPS2 Disney point for my @CAPS1 family vacation. So we take forever to drive there just sitting in the back sent all alone back there no one to talk to but my phone. So we finally get there wasting all my patients on being in the car after we get in we go on the @CAPS4 Space Mountain @NUM1 hour @CAPS5 wait to ride a @NUM1 minute ride it is worth it but still @NUM1 hours is a lot of time. So I m waiting then we get off the ride they we go on the @CAPS6 Pirates of the Caribbean @NUM4 hour @CAPS5 line for @NUM5 second ride. All the rides there were at least 1-@NUM1 hours long. Except one ride the @CAPS7 Haunted Mansion we got there before the crowd came in. So it was on leg @NUM7 minutes and @CAPS8 by the time we got on the ride and at the top of the hill it was probably a @CAPS5 short line. So we really lucked out on that one. But @CAPS8 by the time the park closed and we got to our car there was a huge traffic jam and that was all the patients left so we were in line to leave the park for another @CAPS5 hour and a half so we waited and waited and finaly it moved and once we got through the park and out of it the road we had to take was closed because of a car accident so we had to talk this huge detoer that added a @CAPS5 hour to our time because of traffic taking that way and @CAPS8 by the time we got to our hotel I didnít have one drop of patients left I felt like I was going to blow up but I didnít I acted very patient but it was a good thing I have a lot of patients.
729	18650	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to Six Flags with my family and my friend Ashley. We rode some rides, then my sister said ìcan we ride the roller coaster again?î I replied ìsure, even though it was our fifth time riding the ride. My sister and I went and stood in line for the ride. I said ìwe should ride front row.î She said ìwe should.î So we went to the front row and the line was packed. We waited twenty minutes or so when someone threw up on another cart. The employees had to clean up the barf, which took another twenty minutes. We kept waiting and waiting until they let us on. After the ride, I exclaimed ìwho would barf on a ride like this,î my dad replied ìI donít know.î That day is a day that I remember my patience because I waited forty to sixty minutes for a ride that wasnít worth the wait. What was worth the wait is seeing the smile on my sister’s face and her laughing, showing that even though the wait was long, her happiness made it all worthwhile.
730	18651	7	3	I know a lot of patient people, and I have had many experiences that have to do with patience. My friend, @PERSON1, is usually impatient. Whenever she is waiting for something she texts me saying, ì@CAPS1!î or, ì@CAPS2 onnn!î @CAPS3 one day she was actually very patient. My family, @PERSON1, and I were going to the zoo one @DATE1 @TIME1. We brought snacks and packed everything the day before. We were going to pick @PERSON1 up from her house and @CAPS3 go to the zoo. But my mom slept in and she still had to take a shower! She said we would pick up @PERSON1 on the way to the zoo around @NUM1 am, and it was already @NUM2 am. We were running late and I thought @PERSON1 was going to get mad. Fortunately, @PERSON1 wasnít mad! She was understanding and said that it was ok. Usually, she would say something like, ì@CAPS4, where are you? Why are you taking so long?î @CAPS5 time she didnít say any of that. We ended up going to the zoo around noon, but it was all fun and joy! I have had experiences with many patient people and @CAPS5 experience turned out to be fun! This shows that even usually impatient people can surprise you with their patience, and it can lead to a much better outcome for everyone.
731	18652	7	3	I think patience is all about waiting for something you want to happen or you don’t want to happen. Sometimes it hits uninspected. Specially at Cedar Point you need a lot of patience. Beep! Beep! I hit my alarm clock with all my force so I hope the thing would turn off. Butt @DATE1 I was going to Cedar Point and I couldn’t wait. So I got up took a shower and ate breakfast which was great my mom made blueberry muffins. I got all of my clothes packed a week early because, I was so excited. I put my clothes in the car and my brother, sister, mom, dads so we could get going quicker. The car ride wasn’t so grate because, it was three hours long but we had a tv in our car so it didn’t take as long as it normally does because, were occupied so it is like a shorter car ride for my brother sister and I. When we got into the hotel it was awesome because, it was like @NUM1 stories high. And we also had to use the elevator to get to our room on the @NUM2 floor. My sister was amazed by all of the stuffed animals and wanted to buy the furry things but she couldn’t. My mom woke us up come on the rides open in about @NUM3 min we got be there. So I raced up out of bed running around like I got fire on my butt trying to find my clothes. So found all of my clothes and raced around to get my shoes on the others side of the bed. So by the time we were all up dressed and showered the rides have been going on for an hour so we walk over to the gate and got the one ride called Millennium Force. The sigh said @NUM4 hours wait sorry the ride is know just to got started because of difficulties with the seatbelts and others technical difficulties sorry. So my mom said wait here at ride it is really fun. So was waited and waited I have no patience any more I will buy you a hot dog after this so I did and the ride was a blast @NUM1 hours at the park. Was fun but we had to go tomorrow. And I got my hot dog. That was my story of being patience at Cedar Point when all is you want to do was have fun. Sometimes you got to be patient to get what you want, even if it means waiting in line for a really long time.
732	18653	7	3	One hot summer day my family and I went to Cedar Point. There was a new ride open called shoot the rapids. It was a brown tall water ride with a tunnel and two hills. As we walked over to see how long the wait was it said one hour wait. We all really wanted to go on it so we decided to wait. When we got in the line it was about 90 degrees outside, we were all sweating. And to make things worse there was this annoying little boy talking to me about some food or something. It was really annoying. We were about half way threw the line when my nerves kicked in I was really scared but I knew I had to be brave and suck it up. About 30 minutes later we were four people away from the ride. My heart was pounding, my knees were shaking. I thought I was going to die. Then all of a sudden it broke down. We had to wait another 20 minutes. As time past we finally got on the water ride. I regret it. I screamed and cried but I’m glad I didn’t chicken out. That was a time I had patience and regret it, but ultimately it was a worthwhile experience that tested my courage.
733	18654	7	3	"One time I had to be really patient when my grandma said there was something in the mail for me. I was so excited. I waited and waited but nothing showed up. Then I started getting impatient. My grandma said ""keep waiting it will come soon"". So I did what my grandma said and the next day a big package came. I was so happy it was finally here. My uncle had sent all my sisters and I some new sneakers. Also we all got 2K players. I was so happy that me being patient had finally been something worth it."
734	18655	7	3	One day when I was in third grade in 2010. My mom was driving me to school and she said “When I pick you up today I have a surprise for you at home.” All that whole day I had to be patient, but I couldn’t; I just had to get home to see what it was. I could have pretended I was sick and went home, but I decided to just calm down and be patient. I told myself the school day will be over soon. At 3:00 left school and my mom picked me up. I told her I was so excited to see what she had for me, but I told her I was patient the whole school day! Finally, we got home and she told me to “go to my room.” I said “okay,” when I got inside I saw a little, cute, black pup. I was so happy I got a dog! I said thank you mom, thank you so much dad; I ended up naming her Chloe, and she quickly became a beloved member of our family.
735	18656	7	3	"Being patient is a very hard and difficult thing to do sometimes, but we have to go through it. Being the one who is patient usually pays off. We were on our way to the airport and me and my two younger brothers couldn’t wait to get to Disney World. We got to the airport thinking we would get right on the airplane. But when we got there we found out we had to wait 3 hours until the plane left and we’d be on our way to Disney World. So we decided to play our games we brought with us. We were being very patient. Finally it was time for us to get on the plane. We walked through the long tube that leads to the airplane door. We sat in our seats, buckled up and we were ready for takeoff. We heard the pilot talk into speakers “I’m very sorry, but there is a severe thunderstorm appearing on the radar, we cannot proceed until it clears up.” WHAT!? “How long will it take?” asked my mom. “About five hours,"" she said. It’s a good thing we brought our DVD player so that would hold us off for about two hours. For the rest of the time, played, slept, and just waited patiently. The flight attendant came up to us and said that since we very patient for the whole five hours, even my three year old brother, she would reward us with five Six Flags world pass tickets for my family. In conclusion, when you are patient, no matter how hard it is you will maybe get rewarded just like my family."
736	18657	7	3	Patient is a great thing. It means to be understanding and calm. Sometimes people can take difficulties and pain and still stay calm. Any time when your brother or sister annoys you your still patient and never little back. **I'M** up already!! **GET** up already!! **THAT'S** my brother. I ëm awake! I hollered. I took in a huge gulp of air and let it out with a sigh. I ëm soo bred! my brother shouted in my face, can we **GO** walking I was counting past ten in my mind and then finally spoke **FINE**. I got my coat off the rack followed by little brother. We walked outside right when we saw my mom coming to give me a chore. Youíll have to cut the grass to day and rake the leaves. **Mom** said calmly, **YOU** walk your little brother. **FINE**, I was completely furious **ON** the inside. I tried to keep calm, but the that didnít last long, **HI** **DUDE**! my brothers friend said cheer fully, can you come over and play?**He** asked him my brother looked up at me and I was closing my eyes breaking wont out. I stammered walking back home. I grabbed the learn mower and right when I was about to turn it **ON** **NO** get inside and start your home work. . . Then, you can not the down! One two. . There Ö I counted silently. I walked with a fake grin **ON** my face. **ON** the other hand **YOU** take out the trash! One hundred seventy-fiveÖ! Kept counting. I ran down stair grabbed the trash and walked to the trash can as I dropped the garb age inside I tried to put my self in a happy place **WOW**! I sped inside to gaze at **WHAT** had happened, it turnout my sister broke my x box **ON** the tites because **MOM** wanted to play. If get passed 1 in counting in my brain I ëm going to **EXPLODE**! I thought. I held my little sister and gave her to my mom. **SHE** broke my x box!

I urged to stay silent and patient and I managed to. We walked back home and I threw my self **ON** my bed. **WHAT** a borins day! I spoke to myself. I donít think I ëm ever going to be this patient in my life again!! And I smacked my head **ON** the pillow and said **GOODNIGHT** **EVERYONE**! and went to bed. Wow! **WHAT** a day! Patience means to be understanding and calm. Patience great. I tried and learned a powerful lesson, always try. My life is way better **NOW** I bays try to stay patient and never hit my brother or sister even though they get me 2 mad sometimes. The **WORLD** would be better if everyone would just stay patient, people have to try to checeed, itís a very very famous phrase, so striving for patience can truly make a difference.
737	18658	7	3	"It’s like when you’re waiting in line, that's patience. Or like when you keep on raising your hand and the teacher keeps on saying, ""Do your work,"" and you do it again, she will say, ""If you do that again, you will go to the quiet room."" That's when a teacher loses her patience, because she has repeatedly asked for a certain behavior. So, patience can be tested in different ways, but it's about how long you can handle a situation before getting upset."
738	18659	7	3	It was the first week of football, and we went down to Subway before the game to grab a sub. I was the first one in line, but then others arrived, and one person cut in front of me. Soon, others followed, and I ended up at the back of the line; it felt like an hour! Finally, it was my turn, and I ordered my sub. It had turkey, lettuce, pickles, banana peppers, cucumbers, and fresh spinach. Being patient in that line really paid off, and by the time I got to the back, it had only been 15 minutes. I sighed in relief. We were pumped for our first game; we played Starta and tied, but it was still a great day!
739	18660	7	3	The time I wasÖ.One after school I was walking home with my friends from school. Knowing me, I wanted something to eat. I told my friends to come in McDonald's rest (it's a fast food restaurant.) We walk in McDonald's, the place is crowded. I waited in line after about 5 minutes my friends said “Come on man let's go.” I say “I’ll meet you guys outside” “Alright” they said. About 2 minutes later it was my turn to order and I order a double stack and some fries and I got free milkshake for my patience, she asked what kind did I want. I said strawberry and I didn’t had to pay for it, was totally free and I went outside and told my friends I got this for free and then they said “oooooooh,” that’s when we went home, happy with my free milkshake.
740	18661	7	3	About two weeks ago I order a book series at border online, I had to be very patient so it would feel like three year of waiting. This book series was not like any book series. These books are my favorite, theyíre call the Eragon series. I have read the series two times and I am still reading them. But, I had to wait to get them. I trying to patient, but it was hard. The mailing date said in less than 24 hour. I had to wait for five day before it a came, When I forget about them they come! Being patient is a good quality people can have. So if your patient you will probably get what you want.
741	18662	7	3	A time that I was patient was when I took my first standardized test this year. The test was not too hard, but not easy. I finished it with about one and a half hours left. For an hour and a half I had nothing to do but just sit perfectly still and silent. Sitting still and quiet for even five minutes is hard for a 10 year old, imagine 90 minutes! At first I was fidgeting, then my neck started to hurt, so I layed my head down. I closed my eyes and just layed there perfectly quiet and still. Soon enough the time flew by and the standardized E.A.P was over (done for the day). I was very proud of myself for being patient and calm during those 90 minutes, proving I could exercise self-control even in a challenging situation.
742	18663	7	3	Hi my name is @PERSON1 and Iím going to tell you a story about how one time I was patience. I remember when I was patience. It was chismis day. There was tons and tons of precidens under the tree. There were tiny ones all the way to hamuges ones. But I couldnít even peek at them because my mom and dad were still not up. I wanted to go into my momís and dadís room and wake them up. But no without some brekfast in bed, so when I wake them up they can hurry up and eat so can open my precidens. I made them toast and eggs. After my mom and dad were done eating I finally got to open my precidents, and it was worth the wait.
743	18664	7	3	Patient is when you are tolerant and understanding. Many people don't have patience, while others do. I am sort of in the middle, but hereís a time I had to be very patient. It was a bright and sunny Sunday afternoon. The sun was shining like thereís no tomorrow. To bad I couldnít play outside. I was to busy kicking back, eating popcorn, and watching a big event. It could give me bragging rights I figure I need some hope and patience..î Dude, my brother yelled all happy and in my face. ìHa, ha loser, lions are winning and steelers are loosing ìhe added. ìDon't get to happy , thereís still plenty of time left.î I replied, with a worried look on my face. I was afraid that I ëd loose, but taking deep brother in and out, I was very patient. The clock winding down. It was the being of the spring. The score was 24 to 21, lions lead. I was still a bit worried, but I never lost hope. As the game was coming to an end, the spring back I for the steepless made an awsorde pass and YES I screamed dancing and jumping around. I told my brother, ìwho is the loser now, huh?î wow all it took was patient, and hopeî I told myself. Patient can mean a lot. Not only did I learn that me and my brother can get a little competive but if you just wait and tolerate whatís happening around you, youíll end up getting rewarded!
744	18666	7	3	I guess you could say that patience is one of my bang talents. I go through many things that involve patience and I see it through without awed. Everything knows that the wortplore to be patient in is church service. On chass. You are up, then kneel down, then stand, then sit then, @PERSON1 and ok! It @CAPS1 on forever. Boh so I know that there are a lot of kids that went as patent as me, some of them have @CAPS2 @CAPS3 of other lirastings that make them impatient while others in just are who you are. I know people who are like that there reals anersetic. I canít here still I know that wostoe there nopele struggle in school and I feel bad foe them. There are times that start to feel impatient when there are other people that are impatient. Its worst is I sat impatient with them and I set frustrate because no matter how many times I tell them to stre tuppin, there pencil as to stop complaining the just donít stop. I guess what Iím saying is that every bodys different some people are quiet and someone but, some peak are atutatic while others are academic. Is no different with patience, and understanding that everyone processes things differently helps me maintain my own.
745	18667	7	3	There was a fish named @CAPS1. @CAPS6 live around the @CAPS2 archipelago, a dangerous place for fish that couldn't slow down quickly. Luckily, @CAPS1 was the legendary many codscanth all that specif does is float slowly. Yesterday, @CAPS1 caught two fish and gave them to his wife. Today all of fish are in the desert, which @CAPS1 absolutely despises. Using his patience, @CAPS6 waits for something to jump out. Suddenly, @CAPS6 sees a big chunk of meat on something shiny. At was too far away to grab, though. @CAPS6 went home to his wife. The next day, @CAPS6 went to the current and saw the floating meat again. @CAPS6 lunged for it and started chewing when something stabbed him. @CAPS1 started pulling fiercly when @CAPS6 heard a snap. When @CAPS6 tugged again @CAPS6 fell into the current. @CAPS6 was finnaly free! @CAPS6 also realized the current felt pretty nice. @CAPS6 ate a couple of fish and slept. When @CAPS6 woke up, @CAPS6 saw a big ugly fish standing on two fins. @CAPS1 couldn't breath and @CAPS6 was in a not @CAPS6 snapped at one of the fins of the other fish and died, sealing his unfortunate fate in the desert landscape.
746	18668	7	3	In sports you always have to be patient. Like if your not making any shots or someone is getting the best of you. If your patient and keep working hard sooner or later you will make these shots or get the best of that player. @PERSON1 was very patient in his basketball career. At @PERSON2 high where he went to high school he wasnít the biggest, fastest, the strongest, or even the best, but he was patient. When he was a freshman in high school he tried out for the varsity, but didnít make it. He was so upset with himself and the coaches because he felt like he shouldíve made the team. His mom went fo him and told him not to give up. Unlike most kids @PERSON1 didnít quit or tell himself that he wasnít good enough. He stayed patient and kept working hard. All that worked paid off because the next year he made the team. He went on to go @LOCATION1. He won a championship there with a game winning shot. He went on to get drafted by the @CAPS2 in the @ORGANIZATION1 draft. The @CAPS3ís were one of the worst teams in the @ORGANIZATION1. It took a couple years for @PERSON1 to win his first @ORGANIZATION1 championship. During his first couple seasons @PERSON1 stayed calm and on to win five more championships. In his last one @PERSON1 was getting older and he knew he would be tested. They made it to the finals. The @CAPS2 were getting tired though. They went down in the series 3-1. @PERSON1 and the @CAPS2 kept pushing and kept fighting. Finally the @CAPS2 won their sixth @ORGANIZATION1 championship. @PERSON1 was put in some tough situations, but he stayed patient and played like an all-star, demonstrating the power of perseverance.
747	18669	7	3	The day I was patient was at camp and I was on the ropes course. The person in front of me seemed to slow up, so I had to be patient. When I got up and went through the first rope obstacle, he was waiting on the platform. I had to wait until they took him down. Then I finally got to go out and when I got half way thru the obstacle they told me I had to be patient and wait until all the people got off that platform. It took a couple of minutes but then I finally got to go through. That was the day I had to be patient, but I learned that sometimes waiting is just part of the process.
748	18670	7	3	My mom is very patient woman. She shows it by helping my brother @PERSON1, with his homework. @PERSON1 hates every thing about doing his homework. He hates doing his math, reading, but most of all he hates spelling. When my mom is helping him with all three of thoose things she shows patience because since he hates all of thoos homework assignments he doesnít always do them without a sit. When he does throw a fit she is very patient with him and works on it with him until he is done; that is how my mom shows patience.
749	18671	7	3	Waiting to be the best. Music is pretty much my life, I love the way a song can make you feel, I love how walking a line on the guitar can change your day. As a young musician I all I can ever think about is music, I had reache my primary instrument piano, flute, guitar, the only instrument my family owns I canít play is the bass. So when my flute broke I took mr.groth up on his need for a bassist in high school band. I studied my butt of learning the art of the bass guitar, reading the clef and learning the notes, I was waiting for my ranking to increase and memorization and I quickly fell in love with the instrument. I soon became better and it seemed each week I got better and better. I had easily fell in love with the sounds it made and I had found I loved it way more than the flute, shure it will take time to become a pro but I learned its worth it.
750	18672	7	3	When I first saw my puppy we were at the Humane Society. The rescue people brought over some dogs to be rescued. I saw all six dogs, the second one I saw I knew he was going to be mine. So I got him out, the lady said that he’s scared and he gets carsick, but I didn’t care, he was my favorite. I said I wanted him so she told us to go to the rescue people and tell them I wanted him, so I raced to the rescue people and on the way there I thought of names. My dad came up with the name Buddy, I liked it so that was his name, I had to wait a whole week before I could take him home but as long as I got my puppy I was fine. I got him a toy, when I went back to see him I had it with every night knowing I was closer and closer to getting him, the day finally came. I told my brother we were going fishing since he didn’t know we were getting a dog. But once we were there I ran inside to go see him, I took him home, he was afraid of everything even leaves outside. But now he loves chasing leaves and playing in the snow. And every night I tell Buddy it's bed time and I sleep with my wonderful companion. Because if you want something bad enough, patient is the key.

752	18675	7	3	I believe that patients means that you are understanding and tolerant and that a patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. This story is about the time I was patient with my little brother. @CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1. Five more minutes I muttered after about fifteen more steps from the alarm clock. I jumped out of bed remembering that I was babysitting my little brother Mark. I take the crispy cereal I thought to myself, as I tried to swallow the rock hard breakfast on my plate. I quickly take a shower and get dressed into jeans and t shirt. At the time @PERSON1 Mark was about two years old. Missed there service yet he could walk. He made it hard for anyone to be patient with him because of all his disasters that he has created. But he was so cute that it was extremely hard to stay mad at him. When I heard the sound of a car entering our driveway, I knew we a met @CAPS3 the day. As my mom comes in the house I went up to his aril where he sat patiently waiting for someone to get it out I dressed him in a clean and adorable baby outfit. To him I brought him to the kitchen and made pancakes, which were much lighter than my usual. Crunch crunch went the colorful cereal under his feet. As we played outside. After the game, we played cars for a while it was dinner time. We had macaroni and cheese and before we knew it was nite time. I sat he in the bath and then went to go get him a towel went it came back almost the whole bathroom was wet with warm bath water when I got him dried and dressed, @CAPS3 Mark was not in the towel. I used as of water to him when I was about to lose it and helped him got to bed. It was challenging but I'm glad I could be patient with my brother that day.
753	18676	7	3	I have been a patient man in my life. An example is when I wanted to see Santa Claus their was a HUGE line. I was in the mall and from where Santa Claus was it went all the way to the street. It was 7 PM and my bedtime is 9 PM so I had to hurry up. My sister and I ran to the back of the line where me and our parents were. They saved us a spot in line. It was all ready 8 PM after an hour and the line didnít even move. I was so mad. Every 5 minutes the line would scoot to a bit. When I was about to leave the line just started going up like a boom-army. FINALLY when I started getting excited. All I wanted to ask him was to get me a airsoft gun and a pony. The reason why is because I would ride the pony and shoot people who crossed my path. That would have been the life. FINALLY all I wanted to do. And I think Santa Claus would give me good airsoft gun because Christmas can come earlier than expected. As I was talking to my guys as were next is. We went to Santa. I ask him what I wanted and he said ìyouíll shoot you eye out side.î FINALLY when I got mad because it had to be so patient. That is the last time Iím going to visit Santa Claus at the mall, highlighting the importance of managing expectations and patience in such situations.
754	18677	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at my football game and the defence hid the ball in and I was waiting to go back in. Then finally my friend @PERSON1 intercepted the ball and the offense including me ran in on the field, and then they had me run it up the middle and I scored and then we passed it for the two point conversion and it came to me but it was high and it tipped it then it came right down in my hands and I got it but then I had to wait again because the defence went back in but then it was half time. I am the kick returner and we got the ball as I got the kick and returned it all the way for a touchdown and it was really cool because my team was yelling and I broke a lot of tackles. Then it was the @DATE1 and all the other teams we doing kneeing it and finally my teammate swatted the pass and if one of the other guys caught the ball my team jumped on it and we had the ball then our full back got a pass and got the game wining touch down and that's a time when I had to be patient, but my patience ultimately paid off with the victory.
755	18678	7	3	The definition of patients is, when someone is in a car, & is going a long distance trip and you donít ask to stop or keep asking and asking where you are going. An example of patients is you are at a store, & someone is in front of you with whopping overload of stuff in there kart, &you donít get mad at the person that is called patients. Also if you are teaching something to somebody & they keep messing it up and you donít get mad and you keep trying to teach them thats patients. Another example of patients is if someone has @CAPS1, & they have a hard time paying attention and you donít get frustrated with them then you are patient with that person. Also if the person just walks off and dosnít pay you no mind and you still try to teach or show them something thatís a sign of patients. Sometimes patients because, if you maybe wanít to have a job as a theropist you need a lot of patients, since you will need to work with people who require understanding and support. All these scenarios demonstrate that patience involves tolerance and understanding in challenging situations.
756	18680	7	3	Patience. What is patience? Patience is waiting for something calmly. It's waiting for the right time to propose, or ask her on a date, ensuring the moment is perfect. Life is going to be hard unless you're patient, as rushing things often leads to mistakes. You need to be patient when getting a job, understanding that the search may take time and persistence. Therefore, with patience, you can navigate life's challenges more effectively and achieve your goals.
757	18681	7	3	This is a writing piece on how I had to be patient to get a phenomenal bowl of ice cream. My grandparents had just picked my brother and I up from our house to go get ice cream at Cold Stone. I had never gone to Cold Stone, but my friends said it was good. So I had asked my grandparents if we could go. I was amped. When we arrived at our destination the line was huge. It was shaped like a snake. The sign said “45 minutes wait.” I was disappointed. I was about to leave when I saw it. The peanut butter ice cream. It was staring me right in my face so I talked to my grandparents and said we could stay. When we finally got to the front of the line I ordered peanut butter ice cream. It was time to send my taste buds on vacation. It was fantastic ice cream. It was so smooth. I was thinking to myself how I was glad that I was patient to enjoy that amazing ice cream. That was the time I had to be patient to go get a phenomenal ice cream bowl.
758	18682	7	3	Patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experience difficulties without complaining. There was a time when I was patient. Being patient is difficult to do @CAPS11 I did it before. ì@CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS2, this isnít even moving.î @CAPS3 brother and @CAPS3 broter obvousilly wasnít being patient. Hello, @CAPS13 me mame, I mean man, can you walk any shower? ì@CAPS4, I can if you want me to.î A nice man said in a kind friendly voice to @CAPS5.î @CAPS6, are you that dumb, I wasnít for real. I m cut you just because of your stupuidity .î @CAPS5 said, trying to act all tough. @CAPS5 was only a year older than me (@NUM1) and he thinks heís all big and can di anything he wants. ì@CAPS8, little man you canít cut me, I was waiting in line forever.: that nice man said to @CAPS5. ì well , too bad .î while @CAPS3 brother was making eniesnes, was waiting patiently in line even though the line wasnít really moving, inside I wanted to out every one @CAPS11 not like some people I have patients and can wait. After @CAPS3 brother cut that man and didnít get punished he decided to cut hundreds of people. All those people were mad, very very mad at @CAPS5 @CAPS11 not one did anything besides say,î @CAPS8 donít cut me.î @CAPS11 that didnítí really help. Intill @CAPS5 cutted the @CAPS15 person. That person was a young pretty body with beautiful blue eyes and has such pretty blond hair, her name was @PERSON1 ì@CAPS13 me police man, this young , little boy just cutter we and every one else. ì@PERSON1 said. While I was waiting there patiently, @CAPS5 got kicked out of the whole parkí @CAPS15 in line please, ì ì @CAPS1 thatís me Ö. Won.Were ìwas the best roller coaster I had ever been on. Being patient is hard @CAPS11 can be rewarding. I also learned to be patient takes a lot of understanding and tolerant. Now, @CAPS16 know you get the best when your patient, and the worst when your not. This whole experience showed me that patience, though challenging, ultimately leads to better outcomes, both for myself and those around me.
759	18683	7	3	A kid in my school, @PERSON1, has had a crush on my best friend Mycaela for who knows how long. He has asked her about fifty times. She likes him as a friend but nothing more. She has dated many guys since @PERSON1 first asked her out. Mycaela can be a little boy obsessed. In fact she is now dating a boy who I asked out two days ago, sorry of topic. Anyway, @PERSON1 is always very patient, hoping Mycaela will come around someday. It’s been almost two years with him stalking her and she still hasn’t come around. I just think that @PERSON1 is very patient and he is a great kid. He really seems to care for her deeply, even if his affections are unrequited. It's just admirable, though perhaps a little misguided, how long he's held onto those feelings. His persistence, while maybe not the best strategy, does speak to his good heart.
760	18684	7	3	One time I was patient when my mom was on the phone with my dad for about at least 3.5 hours. We were in the car on our way to grandma's house. I was watching my dog on my lap for the first hour. The second hour I was sleeping. The third hour I was watching a movie and by this time I had to go to the bathroom really bad. Then by the last hour and a half I was legit tearing up I had to go so bad that by the time my mom got off the phone we were at my aunt’s house. I legit ran in and ran into the bathroom and then I was fine, finally able to relieve myself after that long car ride.
761	18685	7	3	I'm @PERSON1 and a year ago I was a foster kid. I had to have patience for a lot of things. First of all, my foster parents got divorced with kids. I had to have patience waiting till my foster mom found a home to move to. Secondly I wasn’t told when I could go home. I had to wait till everything was over, navigating the uncertainty with as much grace as I could muster. Finally, they told me after a year and a half that I could go home to my mom within a week. I packed and waited, filled with anticipation. I had to have patience with everyone involved in the process. It was hard, extremely hard, mind crazy hard. It took two weeks and a day to get home and on top of all that I had to move all my stuff home and unpack; to this day I am still unpacking, slowly settling back into my old life. Being a foster kid takes a lot of patience, more than most people can imagine. I learned that patience is crucial for surviving, and even thriving, in such a challenging situation.
762	18686	7	3	There was a new restaurant opening in town! He really wanted to go so his family went. It had opened 10 minutes ago. They didnít think there was going to be a line. They got there and they didnít see any cars in the drive thru. They went through the drive through which started at the back of the restaurant. Then they say about 5 cars. He was really mad. They were about to leave and then there were 6 cars behind them, so they stayed in line. Since it was a new restraunt everyone was picking their food very slowely. They where also making the food very slowely. Then people started yelling, ìSPEED up,î they where also honking their horns but he was the only who wasnít honking his horn. They where waiting for 5 minutes and 10 had gone by. He was starving and he still was being very patient. He usually is not patient. He was very excited to eat at the new restraunt. When it was his turn the cashier said, ìTHANK you for being very patient.î By the time they got their food it took 1 hour. The food wasnít even good! He showed a lot of patience that day. He didnít honk his car horn and he wasnít yelling. He had stayed in the car 1 hour and he was starving. It is a great thing to have patience, even when faced with disappointing food and long waits.
763	18688	7	3	This is a story about patience. Patience is when someone gives you an older or specific job to do, then you do the job or order with no questions asked even if you don't want to do it. Last week my mom told me to clean the living room. Even though it was hard, I still did it. Even though I did not want to do it and thought it was unfair, I understood it was my responsibility, and I completed the task without complaint, demonstrating patience.
764	18689	7	3	Patience is a very important virtue. It is valued in at least these @NUM1 aspects of life: success and friendship. If you do not possess patience no one will want to be your friend. You have to have patience with your friends or they will not be your friends. I know this from experience. In order to succeed in life in general you must have patience. Whether is waiting for the bus or waiting for a response from a job interview, it'll always matter, even in minor inconveniences. So, in conclusion, I think that patience is a very, very important thing to have.
765	18690	7	3	I believe patience is important for many reasons. One reason is without patience you wouldn't be able to wait for anything. One example is you wouldn't be able to wait in line, whether at the grocery store or the movie theater. My second reason for patience being important is without it people would complain everyday because you use patience everyday. One example is if you're waiting to buy a ticket or waiting to get gas you have to wait your turn to get it, and without patience, those everyday waits would be unbearable. Lastly patience is important because without patience you wouldn't be able to read. This is because books sometimes take a while to read and you wouldn't want to take the time to finish it, especially longer books. That's exactly why I believe patience is important, as it affects our daily interactions and personal enjoyment of activities.
766	18691	7	3	One time I went to a carnival with my dad. We had a blast while we were there. I kept on winning prizes at the games they had. I thought to myself ìnothing will get in my wayî well I was wrong. Everyone has their own level of patience. Mine is low but this one time I was tolerant and kept calm. As we were at the carnival I saw this new ride. Everyone was lined up to see what it was. When I got in line I was ready to go on. Until, someone got in front of me. Thatís when I began to get impatient. This is not going to be good. I waited and waited as the line slowly moved up. It seemed like an hour but, it was only @NUM1 minutes. People kept on going ahead of me. As if they did not see me, so did more people. It got to the point where I was about to say a rude remark. My face grew hot with frustration. As I was about to say the rude things on my mind, I quickly held myself back. I remembered that I wanted my dad to be proud of me. So, as it was my turn to go on I finally did something good. I was so proud of myself on how I did not say anything. When the ride was over I quickly went to my dad. I so proud of myself on how I was tolerant. People going ahead of me wasnít so bad. Look like I can do something positive. If they thought was gonna get to me, they were right. But, they were wrong if they I was gonna say something, and I proved to myself that I could handle frustrating situations with grace.
767	18693	7	3	Every day I must be patient in difficult things. I must be most patient when I am playing or watching sports. Every weekend my brother plays in a flag football league and it can be wearing. I have to sit almost two hours for the games to be over and my parents make me wait in the game. My favorite sport is football and since I am a first baseman and an outfielder, I have to wait for the ball to come my way so that I can help the team. I also have to be patient during the meal because it is a long sit and I must wait until people are all done. As you can see, I am very patient and have to be in many situations, demonstrating the importance of patience in different aspects of life.
768	18694	7	3	Frezing cold and all I could do was wait, and wait, and wait. What I was waiting for was the DOG SHOW on SATURDAY for WALKERS to start. I had friends with me but they mostly talk with themselves, leaving me and my friend SARAH. Her dirty blond hair whips her face, and SARAH hunches her back against the wind. My yellow lab, BUDDY, tugs his leash and SARAH, being the one holding the leash, stumbles side ways. ìAre you sure you donít want me to take him?î I ask for the tooth time. ìRELAX, I got it!î SARAH says happily. I was cold, bord, and hungry, but at least I didnít have my arm being pulled off. ìAre you sure?î I felt so bad, BUDDY was my dog, I should be holding him. Which was SUCH an easy task. ìREALLY!î SARAH says lightly, ìI got it!î BUDDY pulls her again and SARAH falls into me. I catch her, and SARAH mumbles a sorry. I had, but I still think I should take him. All day Iíve been complaining. I was joking about our luck with the weather partly, but mostly, I just wanted to start a conversation. ìI think my hands are numbî I say joining them into my pockets. ìWELL, at least itís not raining, like the weather man said, ìSARAH smiles, and I smile back. A voice booms out of the specker, ìWALKER walkers. Lets get moveing!î I glare at SARAH and ask one more time, ìDo you want me to take him!î SARAH pats my back and says slowly, ìI got it.î It was clear she was determined, so I let it go, trusting her to manage my energetic dog during the walk.
769	18695	7	3	A time I was patient was when I had to baby sit little cousin. He was just a little baby, so I knew that if he started crying, or got upset that I coudn't get frustrated with him because he's a baby. There were times when he would start crying for no apparent reason and I just wanted to scream, but I knew I couldn't and that I just had to be patient with him. I also knew that I couldn't get upset, or angry because it might make it even worse for him, so I had to be patient and wait for him to stop crying and for me to calm down before I could go anywhere near him. I would gently rock him and sing softly, trying to soothe him. I was understanding and tolerant and I didn't lose my patience. Practicing that skill is very important. I am proud of myself and being able to keep my composure in crazy or chaotic situations like that, and not loosine my cool, or patience, with him or anyone else, because I know it helped both of us in the long run.
770	18696	7	3	"Ugh, what is taking the gym teacher Mr. Henderson long? Mark whined. ""Mr. Henderson's been hours"" ""Mr. Henderson's only been 15 minutes."" Jessie said. ""Dude, man Mr. Henderson has felt like its been a couple of hours."" Mark said. ""Dude, you just have to have a little patience."" Kevin explained. ""Easy for you to say"" Mark said. ""Well you sit here and have your patience called patience I'll be putting my bag on the stage."" Sigh Mark got up everybody tried to tell him to sit down but all he did was ignore them. ""Come on man just sit down and have patience "" Jessie said ""Dude, I've been waiting to long I'm bored I'm tired and my feet hurt!"" Mark yelled Sigh he was walking behind the stage. ""You're gonna get in trouble."" Jessie said, looking down. ""Who was just yelling?"" yelled the gym teacher with an angry face. The gym teacher looked to his right and saw Mark behind stage and said ""You couldn't have played basketball but Mark messed it up for everybody."" Today nobody played because Mark didn't have any patience. Today I hope he'll have a little more patience hopefully, so that we can all enjoy gym class next time."
771	18697	7	3	I woke before school started getting ready, grabbed all my stuff and walked out. When I got to school I started hanging out with my friends and having a good day so far. At around 10, 11 hour is over and we go to lunch. I wasn’t hungry and I wanted to go with my friend SARAH she wanted to eat so I waited for her and we went outside afterwards. When we go outside we like to do back walkovers, handstands, backbends, fronthandsprings, cartwheels and stuff like that. After the bell rang in 3rd hour it was recourse I wasn’t feeling good, I was hungry. I just wanted to go home and grab something to eat but we still had to wait till recourse was over then we had to ride the bus for about an hour. When I finally got home I didn’t feel good, my dad asked me what's the matter I told him I was hungry and it was around 4 and he said we have to wait untill mom gets home my mom gets home at 6:00. I had to wait and be patient for 2 hours and I realized it's ok to wait because it was a delicious dinner and if i would have ate something else before dinner i probly would not have aten any of my dinner. And that was a story with 4 examples of me having to be patient, showing that sometimes waiting leads to a better outcome.
772	18698	7	3	There haven’t been many times were I was patient but I’m going to tell you about when I was patient. One time when I was patient was when I was riding home on the bus. My bus driver Ms. Johnson made me sit in the back because she said I talked too much and that I wasn’t aloud to talk the whole ride home. It was hard at first but then I did my homework, specifically my math assignment. Which gave me something to do. That was one time I was patient but not the only time. Another time when I was patient was standing in line for a rollercoaster at Cedar Point. The beginning of the line said that it was a 2 hour wait but we didn’t care because it was my friend’s and my favorite ride, the Millennium Force. It wasn’t so bad because it’s all worth it when you ride the ride. Those were times I were patient but I’ve had to wait patiently even longer than that! So while patience isn’t my strongest suit, I have demonstrated it when necessary.
773	18700	7	3	Hi, my name is @LOCATION1 @DATE1 and this is the time I was patient when waiting to go a friend's house. Savannah's dad is a firefighter and he had to put out a fire and could not pick me up until the next afternoon. I was sad. It was the middle of @DATE2 and I hadn't seen Savannah in @NUM1 months. That day I learned Patience is a way of life people have to live with, and this is the time I had to live with it. Although disappointed, I understood the importance of his job. Ultimately, the wait taught me a valuable lesson about understanding and accepting circumstances beyond my control.
774	18701	7	3	There I was at Six Flags Great Adventure on a Saturday standing in the blazing sun. I could feel the sweat drip off my face. I looked ahead; there was at least two hours left for standing in line for the roller coaster, The Kingda Ka. My family was silent because they were getting irritable. All of a sudden this guy screamed, “Move up!” People in line started screaming at each other except for me. I didn’t want to yell because it would get my family worked even more. An hour later, everybody chilled out. Then I looked ahead. We were almost to the front. I wiped my face and smiled. Then I said, “Yahoo hoo!” My family looked at me like I was from a different planet. My sister asked, “what?” my mom asked. “We’re almost to the front!” I replied. Then we were next to go on the ride. When we entered the ride, I fastened my seat. Next, the ride took off! The breeze felt good against my face. When the ride ended, I said, “I knew patients would pay off.” That is the time I had to have patients.
775	18702	7	3	It was blistering hot, it had already been an hour in line, “when can we go?” I asked in a moaning voice. My parents replied “just be patient we're almost at the front.” FINALLY, that is what I did. My body was aching from walking around all day, but that wasn't going to stop me from all these rides. Ten more minutes had passed and I began to get thirsty. My dad and sister wanted to go get a drink with me while my mum held our spot in line. We made it to the booth. “I’ll take water” I said, feeling realived. I said thankyou, as I grabbed the ice cold water from his hands. As we all started walking back towards the line, I spotted a bright colorful shirt that said, “I LOVE FLORIDA”. I couldn’t help but ask, “Dad can I please get this shirt?” we still have to wait a little bit longer in line if we go back. “Sure he responded but let's hurry up so your mom doesn’t get impatient. After I got the shirt we walked back in the line. Thank goodness we were the second ones up. All aboard the mummy ride.” The person controlling the ride explained. We walked on, being patient payed off, because I had a feeling this ride was going to be a blast.
776	18703	7	3	Hi, my name is [Name] and this is a story about the time I was patient. Once when I was eight years old my mom said that she would take me to the fair that day. So after lunch we went to the fair. I wanted to ride the biggest ride there so we had to wait in line for it. The line was very long so I had to be patient to get on the ride. I did not want to wait in line so half of the time in line I was complaining, but the line was not that long and I have to be patient. I am glad I was patient because the ride was a lot of fun. That day I learned that it was good to be patient. I told my mom I will never be impatient again. That was the story of the time I had to be patient at the fair.
777	18704	7	3	Being patient is a good thing to have. Let me tell you a time I was patient. Once I had a dentists apointment was @NUM1 am and my apointment was at @NUM2 am. Me and my dad sat and waited until @NUM2. It was hurting. I didn’t have anything to do. I didn’t read magazines, they didn’t have a TV or anything. I was really hungry because I didn’t have any breakfast. @NUM4 am still in waiting. I couldn’t do it. It was so boring until I remembered I had a @CAPS2 Gameboy @CAPS3.S in my pocket. So I took it out and started to play it. Time went past fast. That’s the time I was patient.
778	18705	7	3	Patience is the thing I’m going to mainly tell you about, and a time when I was patient and how I did stuff to make myself patient. One day, my dad and I had to wait in the hospital to get a hip replacement, and we had to sit and wait in the waiting room for one hour. I was wondering why we had to wait all the time. Well, they kept telling us to wait one more hour. Anyway, I hurt my chest. Two hours after that, I touched my chest. Then after that, when we had counted the circling tiles for three minutes and noted that there were over four tiles, I didn’t complain yet, at least. After I counted the circling tiles, I played a game with my dad. I won, and we ate up five minutes. The rest of the time, I played my game. I played and then I did it six more times. Then it was time to go home. My dad and I were tired beyond help. I didn’t complain once, and that is the time I was patient, a demonstration of how managing distractions and focusing on small activities helped me endure a long and tiring wait.
779	18706	7	3	Patience is truly the hardest thing, and why is that? It's hard because I'm on punishment for not doing what I was supposed to do. So, I have to be patient and wait it out until my punishment is over because being patient is what's needed for a perfect outcome. From my point of view, while I'm on punishment, I'm just waiting it out so my time will come because I can’t speed things up, and just make it end quicker. If I could, I would, but for now, I have to wait. I'm on punishment for quite a while, so I can just be patient. I know it's hard, but most people have to do it because rushing is most likely not the way to do things; patience also helps those involved and can save you time. Patience is also a good thing to have because you can wait for certain things like money, clothes, shoes, homes, food, animals (pets), jobs, education, a car (transportation), and things of that nature because if you rush everything, you won't get it the way you were supposed to, but waiting and being patient can get you exactly what you want and exactly how you want it to be; therefore, waiting ultimately helps you achieve your goals in the best way possible.
780	18707	7	3	"As I sit in the waiting room at @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1 @CAPS2 waiting and waiting for my grandpa to come to the recovery room, I think to myself what if something went wrong or what if he doesn't make it through the surgery. Then I say to my @CAPS3, ""can we see grandpa now,"" she said, ""@CAPS4 just be patient everything will be just fine if you sit relax and for heaven's sakes,"" ""be patient!"" ""@CAPS5!"" I say to my @CAPS3. After an hour passed, I had gotten on edge so I thought to myself and said to myself calm and patient, calm and patient. Then this lady came out to the waiting room and said, ""the surgery was a little longer than we expected but everything went perfectly fine but he will be staying in the hospital for a week and a half at the most,"" which was perfectly fine with me as long as I could get out of this boring hospital, and as soon as I said that my mom said as soon as grandpa gets to the recovery room we will go see him then we will leave!"
781	18708	7	3	A time when I had patience was when I was waiting in the car to get to grandma's house. From my house to my aunt's house, grandma's house it's about 6 hours away. So I had to sit in a car for 6 hours. The only things to do were listen to your iPod and sleep. Which I didn’t do either of those things. As you can tell it would take a lot of patience to wait in a car for 6 hours. After an hour had passed it would have felt like forever if you weren’t doing anything. By that time I was ready to mess with my sister who was sleeping. I knew I couldn’t do that though. Now was the time to think of something to do. I pulled out my phone and started texting people but no one answered. I tried looking out the window but that made me sleepy. Getting there took too long. Finally 6 hours passed and we made it to grandma's house. This was a time when I had patience, demonstrating my ability to endure a long and boring car ride.
782	18709	7	3	"I was off, I was off to the Ontario auto rama to be exact. We got to see a whole bunch of cool old cars, I also got to see some old ones. Some cars were old and rusty and some are new and state of the art. We saw a sign. It read come see chip foose! So I went and looked around. I found him! I exclaimed. My brother yelled. It was! We went and looked at the end of the line. It was packed! So I figured to would die down after a half an hour. I were very wrong. It was crazy! The line I thought was big was nothing compared to the line now so I had to wait, and wait, and wait. My brother go to the point to where he could run a mile if he didn't he was going to explode. So I had to go walk around with him. I was relived because standing and doing nothing for two hours gets boreing real fast. I was getting to the point where I had to get up and walk around or I was going to fun asleep. So I went for a walk with him. I got back and I sat back down I waited, and waited, and waited and waited. We heard stop!"" The body behind these people have to go and come back after the break."" said the security guard. I were the last people. The people in front of us was a nerdy couple who had no life. My brother started to cry because he didn't get fooses autograph. The kind nerdy couple said ""here have our spat I have all day and you seem like you really wanted this autograph."" My brother replied ""sniff I won't it!!"" I got it after 51/2 hours of waiting and waiting and waiting and dying. That was the time I had to be patient, and it was a truly testing experience."
783	18710	7	3	Patients are people who have been injured in the same kind of way and are in the hospital trying or are getting better. I was a patient once because I was sick for a very long time, so my mom took me to the hospital, and I got shot. Thankfully, the doctors and nurses were able to help me recover from my sickness. On our way out of the hospital, I blacked out and hit my chin on the door, so we had to stay there for about an hour to make sure I was okay. That was the only time that I was in the hospital being a patient, and it was quite an eventful experience overall.
784	18711	7	3	I was patient when I was at home yesterday watching the movie called @CAPS1. So I waited for a long time until the food was ready and he brought it to me. I was so interested in the movie that I couldn’t get my eyes off the t.v because the movie was so good until I was really hungry; then after that, I had a second plate. After that second plate, I didn’t get to eat the rest of my food, and I didn’t complain that I was hungry, so I was content with the amount I ate.
785	18712	7	3	"Being patient is when someone could be busy, it's just better to be patient while the other person is done. I am going to write about a time when someone I know was being patient. Well, one morning my mom had gotten out of work. When she came, I told my mom that I really wanted to go over to my friend's house. But my mom just kept on saying to wait, and so I had to wait, so I did. My mom wasn't even done still, so I told her if I could go walking to my friend's house. But she said no and that I had to be patient till she was done. My dad was leaving for his work in the afternoon, so I had an idea. I told my dad if he could drop me off at my friend's house and then he could leave for his work. So I went to tell him. But guess what? He said no because he was already late, and I looked at the time and yeah, he was already late, so I decided to just be patient because my mom was almost done and my dad was already leaving, so I just sat down and watched TV while my mom was done. My mom had went inside the room, and so I got up and asked if she was done, and she said ""yes."" I so yelled ""so you are taking me?"" and so she did. I was so happy. I rushed to the car, and so we went, and I went, and my mom had left, and that was the day I got to go to my friend's house for just being patient, proving that sometimes waiting really does pay off."
786	18713	7	3	I think patience is the ability to be quiet and wait at the same time. For example, patience is required for everyday tasks like waiting in line for lunch, waiting for someone to pick you up, waiting for your doctor to examine you. I need to use patience almost 10 times a day. First I need to be patient for my mom to drive me to school. I also have to be patient for the class assignment to passed out, for class to be over, for lunch to start, for night to come etc. I hear people say that patience is a virtue. I didn’t even know what that means, but if I’m patient I’ll probably find out. So my conclusion is, patience is required, and people use it everyday. I think patience is a gift and I enjoy it, because without it, navigating daily life would be much more difficult.
787	18714	7	3	ON @DATE2 I understand what my mom was saying to @CAPS1. She told @CAPS1 she couldnít get @CAPS1 anything for @CAPS2 because she had to pay the bills. She thought that she wasnít doing a lot for @CAPS1, I told her Iím fine with what I got. I just wanted to be around her for @CAPS2 but she didnít understand that she was doing good on her own; my father was not helping her take care of us. My mom had to take care of her @NUM1 kids, but herself and @NUM2 of them is his. But my daddy would always say I know if he had it he would give to @CAPS1. But beening @CAPS1 I didnít want to heer his stuff cause it all was lies. My mom had to found tow jobs, to keep up with everything. Then when @DATE1 came everything was ok into @DATE1 my grandma passed away. My mom, auntie and uncle @PERSON1 all had to make money for all here stuff; she looked pretty; everything went while; but know on on we still cry in think about her. Then that was a time I didnít patient because it was to hard to think she was gone. So my mom and them all tell @CAPS1 that I need to learn to understand sheís in a better place with some of her love ones. But into this day I canít understand the meaning of when someone says they are gone, but @CAPS6 forgotten, showing that grief is a complex process that time does not always heal entirely.
788	18715	7	3	The time I was patient. One day we were on our way to Disney World. Our trip was only suppose to be three hours long but one of the cars that was following us was stopped by something that slashed their tire. We had an hour to wait before they would get their tire fixed and would catch up with us. They had to past the traffic and long stoplights also. We waited at a gas station and they caught up. Everyone used the restrooms which took fifteen minutes and the restrooms were so gross so it took a minute to dress them appropriately for use. There were three cars containing five to six people which took up more time. After we were all done we piled back into each vehicle and got back on the way to Disney World. We were passing all signs of kings that said “Disney World Disney World” and “Disney World Disney World up ahead” and even of course when we got there I saw this huge, digital sign that played music and said “Welcome to Disney World Disney World”! We were finally there! We were excited and had the time of our lives!!! By: unica Mrs. AmstrongSupplement. Ultimately, our patience paid off with a magical experience.

790	18717	7	3	Patience is a key role in life; without it, unhappiness often follows. Almost everything in life calls for patience. Impatience can disrupt things, such as your job if you are not patient with your boss or co-workers, potentially leading to conflicts and misunderstandings. I often have a hard time being patient with my mom and dad. Sometimes I just can't stand my parents anymore and I lose my temper and become impatient with them, and that usually makes things worse for me and strains our relationship. I do love my brother, but he can get really annoying, like most little brothers and sisters do, often testing my limits. When my brother gets on my nerves, I become very impatient with him. Sometimes I will get so mad and impatient with him I will just lose it, and I always get in trouble when I beat on him, and I would always end up being the bad guy because of my impatience and the consequences of my actions. Now that I am older, I realize how important it is to be patient with people; it makes life a whole lot easier and fun with the people I'm around every day. That is why when you are patient, you will get your way, but when you are impatient because you are trying to get your way, it will never happen. Ultimately, cultivating patience leads to smoother interactions and more positive outcomes in various aspects of life.
791	18718	7	3	Time I was patient was when my friend was coming over I was excited. I had even prepared some snacks. But I waited and waited, checking my phone every few minutes. She was running quite late. But she finna be here soon, I hope @CAPS1. That's about it.
792	18719	7	3	I was patient when I had to wait for my grandpa in the ER. It was for his heart because he is not doing very well. My grandpa is in and out of the ER for his heart. Every day my grandpa has to go see his doctor to check up on his heart and that is why I am impatient with how long things are taking at times, as I just want him to be okay.
793	18720	7	3	Patience is a thing that you develop when you are calm and relaxed. I have been patient everyday in school. Being patient with my teachers when they explain difficult concepts. I have been patient with kids at school that like to pick on people and tease them, trying to understand their perspective. I have patience some days and others that means something is going wrong and that means I don’t have any more. I like having patience because it makes you get relaxed and everything feels less stressful. Patience is a good thing that you can have. I think patience increases your life span by reducing stress. Many people in the world don’t have that much patience, and I think that decreases their life span. I don’t think if I didn’t have any patience I wouldn’t be in school right now because some kids just have problems and they don’t have it, and they get bad grades and everything. Ultimately, having patience helps me navigate challenges and succeed in school and life.
794	18721	7	3	In this narrative essay I will write about three different times when I was out had to be patient. Such as waiting to get out of school on a holiday. And when I had to wait until my mom woke up to go to the mall so I could get my game. Another thing I had to wait for was to get my final score, as in the results; all these times I had to be understanding. One day I was very anxious to get out of school on a Friday. And to make it worse the clock was slow and I had a planned schedule of my day. When one thought passed by another set in thinking for ways I can stare at the clock and it would change. I was about to get a call home but the bell saved me. And I had to be understanding about that moment. Another time I had to be understanding about was when I had to wait until my mom woke up so I could go to the mall. See what had happened was I got a good grade last year on my report and a new game was coming out so I wanted it. My mom was asleep it was almost impossible to wake her up because she went to the club the night before. And that was the time I had to be patient. Finally, waiting for my final score also required patience, as the anticipation of the result was hard to bear, but ultimately understanding the process made it bearable.
795	18722	7	3	"""Mom, forest, are we there yet?"" Lily asked with curiosity. ""Sigh, not yet,"" Elara replied with a sound of fear in her voice. They were lost, really lost. ""Are we there yet?"" little Lily asked again. ""Sigh, Lily, you’ll just have to be patient,"" Grandma said, becoming annoyed very quickly. So they walked for hours, but still no sign of the castle. Little Lily was eager to meet the queen, for she had imagined the queen as a kind, patient, beautiful woman. Grandma could tell that Lily was tired, lifting her on her shoulders she said to Lily, ""See if you can spot the castle from here Lily."" After a few long patient minutes, Lily finally saw the castle ""I see it, I see it!"" she said with a smile. Jumping off of Grandma’s shoulder, she bolted down the narrow path way because she had waited, she was as excited as ever, not only because she had found the castle but because she learned how to be patient."
796	18723	7	3	A time I was patient was when I got my braces. I was so nervous, so it was hard to be patient. I waited in the waiting room for about fifteen minutes, then the assistant called me in. First, she told me what she was going to do; second, she took an x-ray of my teeth; third, she put metal bands with a really strong glue on the back of my teeth; fourth, the orthodontist put the brackets on with really strong glue. Then the assistant put the wire between the brackets and metal bands; finally, she asked me what color I wanted, then she put them on, and I was free to go. The whole process took two hours, and I had to sit in a dental chair for that long. I had a lot of patience; it was hard, but I did it. That is the time I had patience, and I felt very proud of myself for getting through it.
797	18724	7	3	ìso dad what do you want for your birthday?î ìA gift card.î ìDad what else do you want?î A gift card.î I have been wanting a play station 4 for so long. Itís my thirteenth birthday and I never wanted something more. All my friends had it. Whenever I went over to their house we played night and day. I wanted oneÖ I wanted one really bad. The only exception was that it cost $400 and I already had a $300 birthday party, all together it would be a $700 birthday. So my mom and I decided on an agreement that I pay $200 then she will pay the other half. From that day on I asked everyone for money as a gift for my birthday. I donít want any other presents, I had my eye on the prize. So normally you have a family party where all the relatives come over give you your present and celebrate. I knew thats where I would get my $200. Everything seemed perfect I had it all planed out. Have the family party couple days after birthday then go buy my play station! I didnt mind waiting two or three days. I figured I would live. ìhey mom when are we having the family party?î ìJune 23rd.î WHAT! that moment there was steam coming out of my ears, I could feel my face burning up like I was putting my head in a fire. You might not realize it out June 23rd is a whole month away from my birthday. If waiting 30 days isnít patient then I dont know what is. From this day on I still havent gotten my play station but two days from now Iíll be holding a stack of  cash in my hands and heading to gamertop: Thank god if I had to wait any longer I probably wouldnít have made it. Im not very patient, but I will finally get the game console I have wanted for so long.
798	18725	7	3	A time I was patient was at my friend's cousin's birthday party. I was patient because the whole entire time that we were at the party I was waiting for an answer from my parents and my friend's parents to see if me and my friend could have a sleepover. So during that time that my friends and I waited we colored a couple of dinosaur pictures, watched a movie, ate dinner, played in the basement, went in the garage and ate cake and ice cream, decorated/painted our dance tool boxes, colored some more pictures, watched my friend's cousin open his presents and much much more. Then it started getting dark outside so we tried to take a little nap, it was hard with a whole bunch of kids screaming. Soon enough it was time for my friend to go and then my parents said that we could have a sleepover, but my friend's mom said not tonight because my friend has a volleyball game in the morning. It felt like I waited for nothing. Then I realized when you're patient, you get what you want more often. Ultimately, learning to be patient, even when disappointed, taught me a valuable lesson about expectations and rewards.
799	18726	7	3	Being patient is important, as Iíve learnt before from experience. Once, I chose to babysit my cousins @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. @PERSON1 is eight years old, and @PERSON3 is six years old. I had to watch them for three hours all by myself. I was able to call my @CAPS1 @PERSON2 anytime I was in need of help, but if I did call, I wouldnít get paid. @CAPS3 was to be paid twenty dollars if I could handle @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. This is how I was able to do so. I arrived at my @CAPS1ís house at about one thirty on the dot. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 had just gotten back from a friendís birthday party, where they surely devoured a ton of sugary foods, like @CAPS2, cake, and ice cream. @CAPS3 could tell they were hyper as soon as I walked in the door when they greeted me with bubbly attitudes. My @CAPS1 left and I was stuck with them. @PERSON1 wanted to play on his play station. But @PERSON3 wanted to play box @NUM1. I began to get irritated when they started to argue over what to do. I was about to call @PERSON2 when I decided that being a little more patient was well worth getting paid. So to settle their contradiction, I found a game that we could all play and enjoy together. After playing the game for two hours, we went into their back yard. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 played tag while I watched. However, @PERSON3 being the unfair one denied that @PERSON1 had tagged him, and began to part. I was frustrated at their behavior immediately, and picked up the phone. But then I decided that, with only one hour left, I could handle them. So I told them that we could play hide-and-seek instead, and even though I would normally loathe being the seeker, @CAPS3 told them that only I would count so they wouldnít fight. Finally, @PERSON2 came home and I got paid the money @CAPS3 had earned. That day, I learned that being patient always has its rewards, and that sometimes a little extra effort can make all the difference.
800	18727	7	3	"Patience is being polite by waiting for someone or something. It is polite to be patient; if you're not, you are practically mean because you are judging someone or making them do something really fast. For example, if you are waiting in line for a ride at a carnival, then if you are patient, you're being nice to other people by not trying to hurry them. If you are impatient and standing in line, you would be mean to other people by saying, ""Hurry up! I want to be on that ride already!"" If you are a patient person, people will probably like you. If you are impatient, then you will probably have a hard time getting along with somebody, as people appreciate those who are considerate and understanding of their pace. Therefore, patience is a virtue that fosters positive relationships."
801	18729	7	3	There are lots of times that I have been patient. One time I was taking the standardized tests we had a very long time for the different parts on the test. I was always done early, so I couldn’t go on to the next part. Also, we couldn’t talk or get out of seats. I really wanted to go on to the next part because I had so much time left and nothing to do. Everyone in the class got done early too. Since we couldn’t talk we just sat and waited for testing time to be over. I think everyone wanted to go to the next part, but we didn’t; nobody complained or said anything. We had to do this for a few days every year. Every year I’m always patient during those long testing sessions. That's a story on when I’m patient, showing my ability to wait even when I'm eager to move forward.
802	18730	7	3	Patience is when you understand and you don’t complain. A person who is patient is someone who can wait and they don’t while every two second. A person like that can succeed in life.  ! @PERSON2 was getting closer. First @PERSON6 then @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, @PERSON7. She was coming down my row next. This was a nightmare. When is someone going pinch me so I wake up.  “@PERSON5,” @PERSON3 said with a disappointed force, “@CAPS2 did a poor set on this fest.” I think you should pet on. In my mind I was praying for her not to say the word, she responded, “@CAPS3.” When I got home my mom read the letter and agreed with it. Why did I have to fail history? Next week the outcome came. We sat down; she was about to say something so I took a deep breath, you have to be patient and no complaining. I nodded my head with a smile so big it looked like my lips were about to fall off.  A few weeks later. I got a little better every day. Her name was @PERSON4. She was very nice and thoughtful. She told me I was progressing by waiting and seeing the results. Finally the hundred points test came. I was nervous but confident at the same time. That test is going to wish it never met me! A week later @PERSON1 passed @PERSON6, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4 and @PERSON7. A smile on her face; good job @PERSON5, you got an A-. It was hard in the beginning, but I was patient and I got a good grade.  Wait and don’t hag and see the results of the end. Patience helped me because I know in the future to be tolerant. A person who is patient is a person who accomplishes a goal, showing that through perseverance and understanding, success can be achieved.
803	18731	7	3	A time I was patient was at the barber shop. My sister , my niece, and I were going to the barber shop at @NUM1 in the afternoon. I was getting my hair cut by a official barbor. I waited all the way to @NUM2 pm to get my hair cut. That was a time I was patient, especially as my niece was getting restless.
804	18732	7	3	"A time I was patient is now @DATE1. The reason is because I am waiting for @CAPS1 new phone. See in @DATE2, I spilled orange juice on @CAPS1 phone. Everybody would call me weird and irresponsible. At first @CAPS1 phone was fine and everything alright. Then one day @CAPS1 speaker stopped working. I couldn't call anyone or listen to music. @CAPS1 heart sank. I quickly ran to @CAPS1 dad and told him about @CAPS1 problem. He first laughed and shook his head. Then grabbed @CAPS1 phone to test it. After he disconnected it did not work, his face was shocked. He then asked me how did that happen. Now at the time I was so stunned, so I couldn't figure it. Then the image of me spilling the orange juice came to mind. Something told me to keep this from @CAPS1 dad. I told him anyway, and he laughed. I looked at him with a why are you laughing dad. He said ""You are going to have to wait until I get the money."" @CAPS1 face was calm but here I am still waiting for the phone, learning a valuable lesson about patience and responsibility in the process."
805	18733	7	3	@PERSON1 was your average fourteen year old. @CAPS5 had a @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and an annoying eight year old brother named @PERSON2. @CAPS9 parents weren‚Äôt that eligble with names. It was the beginning of school and @CAPS9 @CAPS3 had to take @LOCATION1 clothes shopping . Problem is @CAPS5 made @LOCATION2 go in. @CAPS5 wouldn‚Äôt complain for a month. @CAPS11, oh @CAPS11, did @CAPS5 have to be a daredevil?! Sigh. Oh well, too late now. @PERSON1 thought here @CAPS5 was, in the boys department helping @CAPS9 @CAPS1 pick not clothes for @ORGANIZATION1. Out of he comes of @CAPS9 eye @CAPS5 sees getting more, daring to get a better look, @CAPS5 gasped @CAPS5 could fail to have @CAPS6 some guys for he school since @CAPS9 pick out clothes in the boys department! I stared, @CAPS5 need is to the girls bathroom and stay there until @CAPS9 were to get @CAPS9. The dare itself was awkward. ‚Äú@CAPS8 for being so understanding.‚Äù @CAPS9 @CAPS1 said. ‚ÄúI know that was laid for you and @CAPS8 agot @CAPS9 not complaining.‚Äù ‚Äú@PERSON1 what, ‚Äú@CAPS8, @CAPS10.‚Äô @CAPS11 being patient is a good thing. @CAPS5 thought as @CAPS5 got out of the class, realizing the importance of fulfilling the dare and maintaining composure.
806	18734	7	3	When I was at a shop I found my friend from @LOCATION1 and he started to talk to me about a patient. He started to talk to me about that, and I told him that I didn't know what that meant. Then he started to explain to me what it was and how it started being produced. Then he told me a story about it, and I was learning about the story, which ultimately helped me understand the concept better.
807	18736	7	3	Every day I have to be patient, actually everyone has to be patient. But have you ever been patient for a sibling? If so then you know how I felt when my sister didn't want to go outside out of her own self wanting reasons. The other day I was trying to get my sister to go outside with me because we have a special willow tree that we hang out by. I was getting off topic, since she kept refusing to get out and exercise I had to result to telling my mother. You can imagine she didn't like that. My sister brought a book, we argued, and then? We got to a certain way, middle of my neighborhood, and we went separate ways. I, of course, didn't like this and had to waste time at a friend's house to have until she realized I wasn't going to follow her. So I've been annoyed with patience, but they say it's a virtue so I guess I'm o.k. with that.

809	18738	7	3	One time when I was patient was when a new video game was coming out. I asked my dad if we could pre-order it but he said no and that I would have to wait until the release date. So I waited until the release date and I still didn't get the game. So I didn't say anything about the game. It was then my birthday and I opened my last gift it was the video game! I was so excited I gave my parents a big hug and me and my brother went to play it. It felt good to be rewarded for my patience.
810	18739	7	3	When you have patience you are calmer, peaceful, and happy. It is like when your birthday is next week and you don’t want to wait for it and have to get mad because you want your presents today not next week. But you can’t, so you get mad, start to hit things, and then you don’t have good behavior. Then you make your parents mad, then they bring some of your gifts back to the store; that is not patience. That is non-patience when you get mad because you can’t get what you want. Patience helps you to stay in control of your emotions and actions, avoiding negative consequences and ultimately leading to a better experience.
811	18740	7	3	"The key for a long road trip is to be patient. This important because it actuly makes the trip go faster. Here is a story about how I had really great patient. We were loading up for a three-hour drive to the local water park in Chicago, Illinois. Everyone is in and ready to go, except of course my parents. Who went inside to check on everything, got directions, call my unlce to see if Mark was ready, and all this time us kids are sitting in the car waiting. Of course my brother David was getting antey and couldn't stop moving around until Mark finaly couldn't take it anymore. ""That's it!"" Mark exclaimed, ""I'm going in to get them!"" Mark was the least patient of us all. Even my two little sisters had a longer patience than Mark had. Which tells you a lot? Tyler comes out 10 minutes later and tells us their coming. WRONG! They didn't come out for another 15 minutes which my brother mad. ""What took you so long?"" Mark asked. ""Mom had to make sure uncle John was ready to leave."" my dad awnsered. As soon as we got going everyone fell asleep accept for my dad who was driving. So no one really did much. At least we were all patient, except for my brother Mark's still like that now. Ultimately, patience proved essential, even if one sibling struggled more than the rest, and it was all smooth sailing after a bit of a rocky start."
812	18741	7	3	Being patient is one of the many things children are taught while growing. They mature and we use these life lessons & life guidences when they need them. I canít tell you how many times my mother told me to be patient. It was used daily while I was growing up. I gradually learned though, & realized how important being patient is. If your being impatient, you have to understand, that the people are most likely trying their hardest to finish what they are doing for your sake. I truly found the meaning of this word when I was seven years old at the mall. Although I had experience this importance & knowing I had to wait, earlier in my life, it didnít mean I was content, and patient. We were shopping in my favorite store at the time called Limited Too. I had gotten a moutain of clothes as well as my sister Ashley who was nine. A dressing room had finally opened after the long wait of about fifteen minutes. Suddenly a dressing room opened, another girl raced in it. I was crying because I was before her, & it was unfair. She cut me anyways. I was the one who waited fifteen minutes. After her fashion show with my mom for about twenty minutes, I was done. I wanted to try on my clothes. I knocked on the door, & she told me she would move it along. So I waited another ten minutes and she was out. It was a rewardance to my patience that got me into the dressing room. I count that day that wether itís a long or short wait, you will get what you want in the long run. So be patient, and good things will come your way like karma what comes around, goes around.
813	18742	7	3	I was very patient last time I went to the doctors, @CAPS1 and my brother @CAPS2 had to wait outside in the waiting room until they called us in for our shots. Everybody else was getting to go ahead of us and we stayed patient. It got really boring sitting in there, flipping through old magazines, but we stayed patient. After about two or three hours we were not as patient as we were a couple of hours ago. So we decided to go up and ask what was going on. We found out that we forgot to sign in and so once we did, we got in shortly after. It was a silly mistake, but in the end, we finally got our shots.
814	18743	7	3	Being patient is about waiting your turn, being calm, you don't complain about waiting like, being patient throughout the day and waiting for school to get out. Not complaining about school being too long or faking sick just to go home or faking pinkeye, etc. You have to wait for school to get out. Being patient isn't just waiting for something to get over; it can be about waiting in lines, waiting to use something, etc. Not all people are patient. I'm not a very patient person when it comes to getting home on time! I don't like waiting for people or traffic or food! I'm very patient when it comes to shots or anything to do with doctors, showing that patience can vary depending on the situation.
815	18744	7	3	"It was one cold morning in wisconson last day of deer hunting. I got up and dressed, me, my dad and friend where all sitting down to eat we had pankacs and milk. Out side it was about 10 degrees so we buttered up and and headed at. I was kind of scary in the worst at night because we don't know whats out there or whos out there. but after we got in. He stand all my ways went away. After two hours in the stand my dad tells me ""it's time to get back and eat"" not right now"" l said ""OK"" said my dad then l guess I'll see you latter so after he came back it wa right around 4:30 when out of the bruch came the buck l was wating for. So l bought my gun up and shot he went right down. I have never been so proud in my life The end."
816	18745	7	3	"Patience, if you are a patient person you are tolerant and understanding. There was a time I was very patient. ""Mom can David go yet!? ""Yes,"" she replied, ""David needs to buy all of your school supplies."" I always didn't like back to school shopping. That would mean going with Mom to a store for 4 hours trying to find clothes, notebooks, pencils binders and pens. ""Dad I really have to go too?"" ""Just be patient ok?"" I replied. Every time I had to get clothes or pencils, I began to get more patient. Whenever I had to wait for Mom. I just sat there, I just sat down and waited. And the day seemed to go by a lot faster it had been 4 hours but it only felt like twenty minutes, when David left. I wouldn't wait till next year, I wanted to go shopping all over again! It seemed that practicing patience made the time pass quickly."
817	18747	7	3	When you are patient, you are calm and without complaining. And you are understanding and tolerant. And when you are patient with something, you are steady with it and **persistent**. Because you are nervous, you are not patient; it gives you a lot of time. And you **must** be very calm and steady, so he is patient. And a **patient** person experiences difficulties. And when patient, **people are** waiting to get something, and they do not know **when,** that is patient. And when your patience, you **stay** calm, and if you **persevere, you will succeed**.
818	18748	7	3	Patience, having patience means you donít complain about things that take long amounts of time. You are tolerant, or understanding. Some reasons why you should **have** patience are things like. You **have to** wait in a extremely long line and the whole time you are waiting you say things like, ì**Ugh**, this takes **forever**.î Or, ì**Ugh**, when **will they** leave.**Can't** it just **hurry up**?î Your **mom** would be thinking, ì**Oh** my gosh would you just stop talking?î Or she would just want **to** scream. So your **mom** probably wouldnít ever want **to** take you somewhere that involved waiting ever again because she knows that you are **too** impatient **to** handle it. Some reasons why maybe you wouldnít want **to** be patient or you would wanít **to** be inpatient could be like if you had a meeting with your teacher and if you were late then you would **make** a bad first impression.So your **mom** is taking **too long** talking on the phone so you keep saying,íí**Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry**! **Mom, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry**! **You** wait very impatiently. Although, patience is basically like a kind, gentle way of waiting. Even though on the inside, your picturing yourself screaming at someone who youíre waiting on. Where on the outside, you are patiently waiting. So, having patience is a good thing. Try it sometimes, just donít let your feelings on the inside tear apart what is happening on the outside, as keeping calm ultimately leads to better outcomes.
819	18749	7	3	Patience is when you are waiting on something. When you rush that’s not being patient. When you are being patient you don’t rush. Another meaning of patience is when you stay calm, that’s being patient, staying from getting angry. Some people say they are losing their patience; that means that they are about to get angry. Those are the meanings of patience. There was a time I was being patient. I waited for my sister to come. I wait, I wait, I wait; I didn’t rush, they say my sister is grandma's birthday. In the bible it says be patient and I did. It wasn’t no telling when my sister was coming, I still wait and finally! My sister came. It showed me the importance of waiting calmly.
820	18750	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my friend Sarah came. And I was getting hungry so I went inside and asked my mom, when is dinner ready? And she said in an hour. Thus, I waited patiently.
821	18751	7	3	Being patient is a valve. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived with her uncle named the benevolent Mr. Davis. One day Lily decided to go out and play. She told her uncle she would be in the woods that day and not to worry about her. Mr. Davis tells her to be careful and to watch out for the wicked witch. Lily skips off to the woods. When Lily got to the woods, she walks strait to her favorite place, the tree fort her uncle built for her about a year ago. When she got there she climbed up to the top and opened the door. Waiting inside for her was not what she expected at all. There sat the wicked witch. When Lily didn’t return home that night, the uncle started to worry. He searched and searched for her but found nothing. He tried to be patient but it was hard. The next day Lily’s uncle got arrested because the police thought that he had kidnapped: Lily. He had to be patient yet again, trusting in the truth. In the end the police found the witch and Lily too and Lily’s uncle’s patience paid off, he was free. From that day Mr. Davis had patience, knowing good would prevail. This is a time when uncle Mr. Davis is patient, trusting in the system that eventually exonerated him.
822	18752	7	3	This week I have been very patient. I really wanted a Wii and no one would buy me one. So I saved up my money for so long. Then I had to wait what felt like weeks was @NUM1 days (@NUM2 week). I was counting down the days. That just made it feel longer. So I decided to tell myself I didn't want it so I wasn't anxious to get it. That kind of worked, making the wait a little more bearable. But when I got it, to tell you the truth, it isn't as fun as I thought it would be. Maybe the anticipation was better than the reality, and now I'm not sure what I'll do with it.
823	18753	7	3	In my opinion, I am a very impatient person. Whenever I ask someone to stop doing something, they'd better stop it on the spot or @PERSON1. I hate waiting, like when a child makes a huge breakthrough; also, I am not one of those kids who waits for dinner, I snack my way to it! And when I am at school, I just @CAPS1 listening to meap instructions for hours on end. That reminds me, my teacher is driving me crazy! He has absolutely no patience in any way, shape, or form. If we make one noise, he immediately goes on a rampage! It seems like patience is a rare commodity these days, and the lack of it only exacerbates daily frustrations. Overall I think people need more patience these days.
824	18754	7	3	Patience is a very good thing that I and a lot of people lack. One person that does not lack patience is the head coach of the Chicago Bears, Matt Eberflus. Matt Eberflus has been very patient for the past couple years. He did not try to make his team be better than they were he just had them try their best and see what the end result was. The Bears ended up going 3-14 that year and by getting the second worst record in the national football league they got the second pick in the twenty twenty-three draft. In that draft the Bears took Will Anderson, an defensive lineman out of the Alabama. He is an outstanding player and the Bears other pick was a fast running back named ROSCHON JOHNSON out of the Texas. Matt Eberflus's team is so good this year because of Matt Eberflus's patience with his team and his understanding of his player's talents, showing that a measured approach can indeed yield impressive results.
825	18756	7	3	Who likes being patient it's so boring. Pretty much all it does is waste your time. But we all know it's good to be patient and to have patience. I am not a really patient person but there're lots of times where I have had to be patient. When I was 8 years old I lived in Utah with a family of six not including me. I really liked video games and I have 2 older brothers and 2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. That was the game cube. Also we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patient to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called Super Mario bros and couldn't wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didn't complain I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I was still not complained. I ended up sitting there for 3 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you can't do it just be patient and it will pay off.
826	18757	7	3	"A time that I showed patience is when my sister broke my futon. It was the day that I had gotten it and I was in the living room watching a movie when all of a suddent I heard ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1, thump, crack!"" I ran upstairs to find out what happend and I saw my sister on the bed, and my other sister standing there pale as a ghost. I showed patience by not yelling at them, even though I was really upset inside. I soon got another futon that isn't broken and now my sisters know not to mess around with things that can break! And that is my story on how I showed patience once!"
827	18758	7	3	One day when I was walking outside I found a snake on a rock. I yelled for my big brother who was playing his game. He said, “Hold on, I need to beat the level,” but the snake was getting irritated so I said, “Now, hurry, it’s leaving!” Finally, after ten minutes, he came out of the house and stared at what was in my hand. He asked me, “Why do you have a snake?” I replied, “I saw it. Cool.” He looked at it and let it go, deciding it was best for the snake to be free.
828	18759	7	3	"One night, when me, @CAPS1 and @CAPS9 sister, @PERSON1, were asleep. Our parents were on the computer. @CAPS4 usually don't stay up that late. So I just thought @CAPS2 was doing something for work. In the @TIME1, when we wake up, @CAPS9 mom and @CAPS2 were standing in the kitchen with smiles on their faces. @CAPS2 was holding something behind his back. ""I wonder @CAPS3 it could beÖ."" I thought. I asked @CAPS9 mom ""@CAPS3's going on!?!"" @CAPS4 said nothing, but @CAPS9 @CAPS2 slowely brought up a document from behind his back presenting it to us. The heading on the document said ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8."" @CAPS9 parents were smirking @CAPS11 @CAPS9 sister and I stared at each other in amazement. @CAPS11 if we were reading each other's mind, we both well knew that we were going on a cruise! I grinned excitedly and looked at the @CAPS15 on the paper. ""@DATE2 @NUM1 - @DATE2.'' it said. Today was @DATE1. I said to @CAPS9 @CAPS2 ""That's like, two months away!!!."" ""@CAPS10,"" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 said, ""you must be patient."" @CAPS11 normal kids did. I said ""@CAPS12Ö"" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 knew @CAPS9 disappointment and said ""@CAPS14 things come to those who wait. I nodded contently. I knew that I was going to have to rough the two months out and be patient. The first couple weeks felt like mont's to us. We were oh so anxious @CAPS11 you would guess. But, @CAPS11 time progressed the patient got easier. I was able to focus on other things beside the cruise. On <@NUM2 @NUM1, @DATE3</@CAPS15>, the time come for us to head on a plane for the cruise."" That quick! It went by that quick! I m so excited, @CAPS2! I said when we were boarding the plane. ""I'm proud of you, son. You we're patient!"" That's the time of how I learned to be patient! @CAPS11 @CAPS9 @CAPS2 says, ""@CAPS14 things will come to those who wait."" And he was right, learning patience was worth it in the end."
829	18760	7	3	A time I was patient was when I had to save up my money to get the new game Halo Reach. I had to pre-order it with my own money. So, I did a bunch of work. I cut the lawn at my house, then I cut other people's lawns for two dollars each. I did that for about two months. At the end, I ended up with three hundred dollars, a goal I worked hard to achieve. I pre-ordered it, and they told me I had to wait for three weeks. So, I did just that. I waited and bought some other smaller things with the leftover money to pass the time, and the game finally came in the mail. That's a time I used patience to wait for something I really wanted.
830	18761	7	3	"Once there was a girl. She was very impatient until she was taught how to be patient. One day Sarah was going to get her drivers licence. She was seventeen and was so excited to be able to drive. When Sarah got to the licence place she saw that there were a lot of people waiting. She estimated about 30 people were there, ""Why did there have to be so many people here,""she thought to herself. After about 10 minutes of waiting she got really mad, because only one person got his licence in the time period. She threw a big fit right there. ""ugghh! I was supposed to get my licence today not wait around for a bunch of experienced adults to get their licence renewed!"" she started blabbering and said. ""Why do you guys take so long! You are so slow!"" she went home and started talking to her friend Amy on the cell phone. ""Amy there were many people I am never going to get my licence Amy!"" ""Sarah just calm down. Stop being so impatient."" ""But the line was so long and . ""Jessica cut Sarah off. ""If you keep running home crying, you will never got your license. The line for a driver licence is always that long. I had to wait 2 hours to get mine."" ""Five hours!"" ""Yes, Sarah I took snacks and my phone with me so I wouldn’t be bored. Take your phone with you. ""Fine,"" Sarah replied.The next day she went back to the licence place, she took her phone and a book with her. While she waited, she texted her friend, went online and read her book for her book project. She kept moving in the line and she didn’t even realize it. Sarah waited for five hours that day and she only thought it was four because she was preoccupied. Sarah felt great when she finally got her licence, she was the second one in school to got her licence (after Jessica). ""Thank you Jessica, you taught me how to be patient and calm down."" ""No problem, it’s the least I could do for my best friend."" And so, Sarah finally obtained her license and learned the valuable lesson of patience, a skill that would serve her well beyond the DMV."
831	18762	7	3	Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. One time when I was patient is when my parents did not know it was a half day at school. One day in elementary school we had a half day which parents didnít know about. After school I waited in the parking lot for close to @NUM1 minutes waiting for my parents to pick me up. I was starting to think my parents werenít coming until a teacher asked me what I was doing. After I explained my situation the teacher let me call my parents. My dad had apologized and went to get me after I explained, and I could finally go home. I remember feeling relieved and not angry because I understood it was an honest mistake, showing my patience in a challenging moment.
832	18763	7	3	I've been patient plenty of times, but when I ordered a new game console, that is when I had to be truly patient. My dad and I were getting a game console that would arrive at our porch in two weeks. For me, it felt like a lifetime, but I had to keep patient. Each day seemed to drag on, filled with anticipation. Not for those fourteen days did I complain, neither did my dad. We both knew it would eventually arrive. When it came, it was definitely worth the wait. The new console provided hours of fun. That is a time when it was necessary to have patience and to not complain, and it ultimately made the reward even sweeter.
833	18764	7	3	A time when I was patient is when I was at the festival. I wanted to get something to eat, and the line was big. Another time is when I wanted to get on a ride; the line was giantically large. It was for the @CAPS1 CRAZY @LOCATION1 TOWN @CAPS2 pirate ship, the swing. There was a line to play this basketball game; it was big, and waiting tested my patience, but I managed to wait.
834	18765	7	3	Have you ever had enough patients to deal with 5 screaming kids? I can proudly say that I can. It all started when my Uncle Steve and Aunt Carol decided to move to Florida. They needed a lot of help, so my Aunt Susan decided to take all five of her kids, my sister, and me down to Florida to help them. The only problem was there were 7 kids and only 1 her. So we packed up all of our bags and headed out. My Aunt Susan has an expedition car so all 7 of us could fit. But, it didn't take long for everybody to get uncomfortable. Everybody starts to feel smoshed in and get really hot. So all of the 5 kids start fighting. My Aunt Susan got real stressed real fast. I thank God that there was at least a T.V in that car. But I was sitting in the front, so I didn't get to watch it. After about 3 hours I'd had enough. My legs were getting all cramped up, and the constant motion was making me dizzy. By now we had been driving about 7 hours, only having one rest stop. It was dark out now. We were the only ones on the road at the moment. I sank lower in my seat. Then BAM. Everybody screamed, even my Aunt Susan. At first I thought we got into a car accident, but when I opened my eyes I was alive. We had hit a deer. It slid across the hood of the car! Finally, after about 8 hours, we reached Orlando234. It was 10 in the morning! I ended up surprising myself with how much patience I had. After that, I don't think that I want to go on a road trip again, as the experience tested my limits and made me appreciate peaceful environments.
835	18766	7	3	Patience is when you have problems and don't complain. You need patience at an amusement park to wait in all the lines, especially for the most popular rides. Patience is not complaining about being bored on a long car ride; instead, you can find ways to entertain yourself. You need to be patient to fish or to be rewarded, and it can save others headaches by preventing unnecessary arguments. You won't always be stressed if you are patient. So you should always be patient; it can make your life so much easier; long lines won't seem so long, and fishing is very rewarding for patience, bringing a sense of calm and accomplishment. Cultivating patience truly enhances our lives.
836	18767	7	3	Patient day. I remember the time when I was patient for a toy car. Four days! I hate to wait for one whole day. Each day it felt like I was in jail. So I was getting mad each day, slapping people in the face it was so funny, so my parents were mad at me. Then my mom put me on punishment. Then a couple of days later I was doing good in school. So my mom was so proud of me. Then she bought me a lot of stuff. Later that Christmas day we had turkey ranch dressing. Then I opened my presents. I got the toy car, two monster truck cars, shoes and NFL's blue, red, and any colors you can think of. So that is why I was patient for that toy. I was so happy and my grandpa stopped by and gave me three dollars. Then he took me ice skating to where these skinny tights were. But it all worked out for me at the end. I got everything I wanted and I want a load touch with the three toys. It felt like I was rich for Christmas day.
837	18768	7	3	"One day it was this girl who really wanted to go school shopping. She had to wait because her mother said she wouldn’t get her money now, but she would get it later in August. Her mom said wait until later. She did not know that her new stuff was up in her room, so when her mom got back, she said, ""When are we going to go?"" In August, her mom said, ""Go get your jacket upstairs in your room."" She went upstairs to get her jacket. When she went up in her room, she saw new clothes and five pairs of new shoes, and she screamed. She came downstairs and told her mom thank you. Her mom said you’re welcome. In August, her mom said, ""I told you I was going to get your stuff,"" and she said, ""You just have to wait patient."""
838	18769	7	3	Patience is a feeling that you get when you experience a difficult task and do your best to overcome it without complaining about the task, like when you're getting paint out and then you squeeze it and it won’t come out, but you still keep trying until you figure out that it is gone. Then you go get a new bottle to start using, accepting the situation and moving forward. I wish that more people were patient; then we wouldn’t have to listen to constant complaining, and perhaps, we could all accomplish more together.
839	18770	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was when I had to **babysit** my little brothers and my two cousins. This was going to take a lot of patience. One day I got a phone call from my aunt. She said she needed a **last-minute** sitter for my two year old and seven year old cousins. she said she would pay me if I would **watch** them. So I said sure. I **didn't know** what I was getting myself into. A couple days **with** my mom **helping** turned out pretty good for me after all.
840	18771	7	3	Patience is probably one of the hardest things to do in the world. One time I remember when I was patient was when my family and I went to Cedar Point. When we went to Cedar Point we all were ready to ride the Magnum XL-200, which we never got to ride the last time we were there. So we were planning on riding that first. We got in line; after a little while, we had to wait for the rain to stop – the wait was an hour and fifteen minutes. So I decided that I would be a little more patient and not complain. Although, not being able to sit down after a while gets kind of painful, but I still never complained. A little while later I actually started forgetting I was in line because the ride operators started letting more of us on. I guess not complaining works because my whole family was in a good mood after we got off the ride. So I decided to learn how to be a little more patient with people because of how good every thing worked out until we got to the bumper cars. Ultimately, the experience taught me that patience can contribute to a more positive experience for everyone involved.
841	18772	7	3	"Walking into the ornate double doors of the theater, I am greeted by a man in a suit, ""Welcome to the Fravsthat,"" the man announces. As soon as we enter, we can walk on further to the lobby in front of us. ""When does the show start?"" I ask excitedly. ""Not till about 8:30,"" my mom replies. Eight thirty was about an hour away, and we couldn't sit down due to the crowd ahead of us. Ten minutes passes by, and not one person was admitted into the show. Not even the elegant music could mask the crowds uproar. Another fifteen minutes passes, and our seats finally await us. Walking down the walkway, I ease into seat 14 as the show begins, finally bringing an end to our stressful wait."
842	18773	7	3	Being patient is sometimes a difficult character trait. It's a good one to have too, it can help you in a lot of situations. If you have patience, you wont get nervous or anxious about something. I was patient when I had to wait a week for a birthday present my friend was getting me. I didn’t think about it that much so it didn’t really get to me. I knew it was going to be really cool, which made being patient a little bit harder. I was still able to keep it off my mind. I had to make sure I didn’t think about it, so I wouldn’t beg my friend to know what it was, because that would be impatient. If your impatient people might get annoyed because you will always ask questions, and get on there nerves. It’s good to be patient with friendships, so you don't become mean to them or anyone else. It’s also not good to be impatient with your family. If you're patient you can work things out better, and stay more on task and focused, which makes patience a valuable trait to cultivate.
843	18774	7	3	When you're at a store or the doctor, or anywhere where you have to wait for something, you always have to have patience, or you will never be able to do anything. I remember when I was at the store with my mom; we had to wait in this long line just to buy a few groceries, but if we didn't have patience, we would have put our stuff back and gone back home. But since we did have patience, we got to buy our stuff and finally go home to make dinner. That's why, if you don't have patience, you won't be able to do anything you want to do. Therefore, developing patience is essential for achieving our goals.
844	18775	7	3	"The story begins at ArtPrize. I loved seeing the beautiful art there, but I was dying to see the winning picture. My parents told me to wait until we saw the rest of the amazing art. So, I sighed and replied, ""Okay, we can see the rest of ArtPrize first."" While we were looking at the art, the whole time I was thinking about the winning piece. That's all I thought about. A little bit later, I was thinking of what a blessing it is to be here at ArtPrize. So, I checked up and decided patience is good. If you wait for something for a while, all of a sudden it seems more valuable. A couple of hours later, I started to head to the car, and my mom interrupted and said, ""Don’t you want to see the winning piece of art?"" ""Yes, I forgot,"" I replied. There was not a line, so we went to see it. It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen; it was a picture of sergeants drawn out of just a pencil. That day I learned that patience is important because that way, it was worth the wait to see something that you like."
845	18776	7	3	A time when someone else I knew was patient was when I was trying to have sleepover with my friend @CAPS1. My parents ordered pizza for me and my two brothers because they went out for their anniversery dinner. It was around @NUM1 pm when they left, and we just started digging into the deep dish @CAPS2ís pizza. Halfway through dinner I got a text from my next door neighbor, ??? my best friend, asking if I wanted to have a sleepover. I replied saying that my parent are out, theyíll be back in a few hours, Iíll ask later. @CAPS6 finally around @NUM2 pm my parents came home and I asked about the sleepover. She said, ìI donít know.î And walked away. About a hour later I got my answer. It was a yes! I texted @CAPS1 and said that I could. She replied ìfinally!î @CAPS4 I had to go pack. @CAPS6 I went to my room and got everything I would need for a sleepover. I was just about to walk out the door when my mom shouted from upstairs, ì@CAPS5! I need you to take the dogs out before you leave!î @CAPS6 I dropped everything, put the leashes on the dogs and stood outside in the pouring rain waiting for them to finish up. When they were done I grabbed my stuff and ran out the door before she made me do something else. When I got to @CAPS7 house she opened the door and let me in. I said, ì@CAPS8 it took @CAPS6 long. Thanks for being @CAPS6 patient!î Even though it was difficult to coordinate, my friend's willingness to wait demonstrated her patience.
846	18777	7	3	I don’t have a time when I’m patient, so today I’m going to write about how impatient I am. I think one day I was in a long line at the store (Walmart). It was a hot day, and I was ready to go to my cool and big house and relax and chill out. You all know how old people are; they walk slow and talk too much. If you already noticed, three of those people were in front of me. He was taking all day taking out his wallet and talking too much. So I said, “you know what? I’ll just go to another Walmart and get me a slippery Dew right now, I can’t deal with this slowness or a humid day,” and left. That is why I know my patience can wear thin when faced with delays or discomfort, and I'm not afraid to change my plans to find a quicker solution.
847	18778	7	3	"Being patient can sometimes be very hard, especially, when whatever you are being patient about is really distracting and painful. This is the story of how I had to be patient when I fell outside and hurt myself. One day, my brother and I were playing outside. We were having fun throwing water balloons at each other. I was already soaked from head to toe but we still kept playing. Suddenly, I heard a buzzing sound by my ear. I turned around and saw a huge bee next to me. I was only 6 years old and very afraid of bees. I turned and ran down the driveway and kept going around the house, thinking that the bee was still following me. I was starting to get tired so I tripped and fell, scraping off a good amount of skin in the process. I immediately began to cry when I saw blood passing from the wound. I ran inside to tell my mom. ""Mom! I fell!"" I managed to scream between sobs. ""Oh my gosh! Let me go find some band aids,"" my mother replied. The pain was intolerable for my little body. I kept silently crying but I knew I had to be patient while my mom went to look for bandages. Just yesterday I had wasted a bunch of band aids by plastering them across my doll's face. I had to be patient and wait for a long time, till my mother finally found the bandages. ""I found them!"" my mom said, while running down the stairs. ""Are you okay? Thank you for being so patient."" She stuck the band aids across the cut on my leg and then gave me a lollipop. I knew I had been a good girl by being patient."
848	18779	7	3	Yo! Iím the narratorÖ you know the dude that tells the story, well Iím gonna tell you a story about patience. Ok, so, there was this armadillo. His name is Arnie. Now Arnie is no ordinary armadillo. Arnie was an armadillo without a shell. All the other armadillos made fun of him and told him to get a shell. So Arnie being the smart Arnie he is thought about this idea and decided to make a shell of his own. Arnie went to the junk yard to look for things to help him make his shell. He found a lot of light weight metal so he took it home, melted it down, and started the long process of metal smithing his shell. When his shell was complete he tried it on and it fit nice and snug. The next day he went to school and everyone was so impressed and it was super shiny. Arnie was no longer made fun of. Arnie had to be patient to make his shell! It was a long and difficult process, but he persevered.
849	18780	7	3	Being patient is a very difficult thing to do. Many people can’t be patient. For example my brother. If he orders something online or is waiting for dinner to be prepared, he always has to whine about when he’s going to get what he wants. I’m not like that. I actually have patience. For example I needed shoes so I searched the internet to see if I could get a good deal. I was searching on the Nike store when I saw these really good shoes. I asked my dad if I could order them online. So the next day my mom orders them online, I was so excited, I waited and waited. After three days I missed my school bus. My mom had to go to college and she couldn’t drop me off. So I stayed home alone. I found out that my dad was coming home that exact day and the house was a mess. So I started cleaning. My mom came home and saw a box laying on the front porch. She picked it up and opened the box and saw my shoes were in there! I went to go welcome her and I saw my shoes lay there. I jumped up in excitement and put them on and it was a perfect fit. My mom came in the room and said they were supposed to arrive on Friday but since you were patient they came early, showing that good things truly do come to those who wait.
850	18781	7	3	"I have never met a patient person until I met @PERSON1. This girl I know, @PERSON1, she is always patient, like the time I was scared to go sledding down the hill, and I would not go down the hill. I kept saying, ""I’m not going down the hill."" About @NUM1 minutes later, she was still patient. She said, ""@CAPS2, I'll go down first, then will you go down?"" I said yes, so she went down, then I went down. And the day of last year's dance, I was taking so long to get dressed, and we were already late. @CAPS1, she was so very patient; I was so surprised. I think she has a surplus of patience. I hope some of it rubs off on me because I need some, and as soon as possible, and a lot of it too because I bet I'm the only person in the world without patience, wow! It is clear that I can learn a lot from her example of patience."
851	18782	7	3	One rainy day my dad's leg was brothering him. He took medication but that didn't work so we took him to the hospital in Coro. They looked at his leg and they told us we had to go to the hospital in Covent Hospital in London so we got on our way to London. When we got to the hospital there were like 30 people in the waiting room. My dad had patience to wait. When we had to go in the room, my dad had to get x-rays. He also had enough patience to wait to see what was wrong. When he found out what was wrong, he had to wait even longer to see if he had to get surgery on his leg. Well, after he had all the patience he had to go through surgery. He had enough patience to go through surgery. It is a good thing my dad had all the patience because his legs are all better. I didn't think my dad had enough patience, but he proved me wrong, and now he's doing great.
852	18783	7	3	I am patient every even this year for @CAPS1 so I can get some @CAPS2. I was buying @CAPS2 but I can't buy any more because @CAPS1 is coming up, that's why I half to be patient because it will seem longer if I keen getting excited. Every day is patient, sometimes I can't wait to get out of school so I can play. I'm always trying to be patient because it's one holiday after another, each one gets more exiting. Every kid tries but being patient is one of the most hard thing to do. How I'm patient is I act like nothing exciting is even comimg up. It helps to think about other things to distract myself until @CAPS1 arrives so I can finally get @CAPS2. Staying calm and acting like it is not happening makes the time go by faster, and this is how I manage to be patient.
853	18784	7	3	Today was Thanksgiving. We had to drive up to *Grandma's house* to visit my cousins. The car was burning an *entire gas tank* trip. But the patience was hard. I wish I *had* a plane ticket out. I saw cool things *on the way*. I *was excited* to *get* out there. We turned off the highway *onto a dirt road*, and we were *greeted* with family. We sat down, caught *up*, we gave gifts, and @CAPS1 *ate* a turkey @CAPS2 *dinner*. *It was a great Thanksgiving*.
854	18785	7	3	On my way to @STATE1 I was patient because I had to wait for the buses. I also boarded several connecting buses. On some stops it seemed like buses took forever; @NUM1 minutes felt like hours to got to some destinations. Those haves and have-nots in terms of bus schedules made me anxious. I was so tired that the last bus I got the I fell asleep.
855	18786	7	3	Today was the final day of tryouts. The deciding day. Tryouts were over and I patiently waited for Coach Miller to hand out the envelopes to all fifteen girls. I didn’t know if I could handle this. “Do not open your envelope until you’ve left the building,” Coach Miller said. “It’s only fair. If everyone opens them in here then people who don’t make the team will be sad and bummed while the girls who did would be jumping for joy, which would make the girls who didn’t make it feel even more bummed and left out. Be patient and do not open it until you leave the building.” she called my name. I came up and grabbed my envelope. She dismissed us. Some girls opened their envelopes right away. But, they didn’t make it. Karma. I waited until I got outside. I could barely breathe. I needed to know but I had to wait. Patience isn’t such a lovely thing always. I opened my envelope. I made the team! I was so excited and I was glad I had the patience to wait and be surprised.

Eventually the all too familiar click was head and the smooth metal doors slid open to reveal a well furnished hallway with many other people waiting **for** their turn of departure on the **floor**. I slipped out, trying now to become trampled by the massive crowd, then, silence. My footsteps echoed off the **walls** as I searched **for** room **12**. Finnaly finding my destination I open the door and step inside where many other squirring children are waiting. I remove my coat and hang it on a nearby hook, trying not to draw too much attention to myself. I continue by searching through the magazine section, torn up **old** magazines and delicately handled sports illustrated are flipped through until I find an interesting looking article on swimming. Magazines under my arm I choose a seat in the far corner to wait in. Minutes pass, I can tell that the child next to me is becoming impatient fast, he taps his mothers jacket repeatedly and asks the same thing he did **two** minutes ago, ""how much longer?"" The mother checks her watch and in a closely annoyed tone replies, ""not much longer now dear."" **Sighing**, the little boy slumps back in his seat and jams his thumb into his mouth to keep him occupied.

Somewhere across the room, a girl about my age frowns as **she** texts on her cellphone, after a quick glance at the clock **she** scowls and continues.

""You know it’s funny,"" **she** says well snapping her gum. ""**For** someone. So young you were the most patient person out there!""

858	18789	7	3	One day my brother, my mom and me were going to the doctorís because my brother was sick. When we got to the doctorís officeís and sat in the waiting area. They called my mom and brother. So I had to stay. My mom told it will only take two minutes. Guess what she was wrong. It took her two hours to come back. So while I was patient I texted my aunt and friends. I also played some games. I actually brought my IPAD with me. So I waited and waited. I was so bored I went outside for some fresh air. Then I got tired I just sat there. Finally they came out. Guess what my mom said ìhow are you sweetyî, then my mum told me my brother was sick. I was so patient that we got to eat at MCDONALDS. after the visit I was patient at the clinic so then we spent 30 minutes. Here so I was ready to go to sleep. I was happy because I was patient its not that hard to believe its actually easy. Thatís a good day.
859	18790	7	3	Patience is when you get in a long line at the grocery store when you are waiting for a new video game. That happened to me when I was on the great journey to California. I had to stand in six very long lines for up to 2 hours; it took forever to get on the plane. When we finally got there we were hungry so we had to wait in line for 30 minutes; when we were finally up to get our food we were starving. We ate and went to a friend's house; we stayed for an hour. It started to get boring but I had patience and waited; turns out it was not so bad after all. Being patient is an important thing in life; whether you are or aren't patient is up to you. That week was all about patience and lines, lots of both; it was a long day. Sadly we had to leave after that day which equals, yap you guessed it, more patience. First we had to go Houston, Texas then Southwest Airlines, then we had to drive 12 hours to get home. When we got home we were so tired and passed the story to my friends and family, showing that even though traveling can be difficult, patience can make the journey more bearable.
860	18791	7	3	To be considered patient, you must be tolerant and understanding,and you cannot complain. I love babysitting my little cousin, especially when they are still infants. This past Saturday, I went to my cousinís house to watch her daughter Lily's baby, for about three hours. I was getting paid fifty dollars, and I couldnít wait. When I got to their house, Lily was sleeping, and I woke her up as soon as her mom left. As soon as I did that, I figured it was a bad idea; she started screaming at the top of her lungs. I picked her up, rocked her, played games, put her in the swing, and even tried to feed her but nothing worked. I was so upset, I felt like screaming. The baby cried for an hour and a half, and wouldnít hush. Then I said, ìLily, whatís the matter ?î As I spoke, there was a moment of silence; she had stopped crying. At that moment, I realized I was being patient because I stayed somewhat calm and I didnít complain to Lily's mom. Ultimately, remaining calm and refraining from complaining demonstrated my patience in a challenging situation.
861	18792	7	3	Every year since I learned about Christmas and presents, now that I think about they never said you'd have to wait months until CHRISTMAS came around. I love CHRISTMAS but once a year or so I am not patient enough to wait until December downward. The first days of December told me CHRISTMAS was coming along with all we decorating ,carolling and wistfull of CHRISTMAS joy. I usually try to pass the time by having snow ball wars with my cousins. I still feel temptation trying to rush time and make me anxious and grueling to wait so long but I am still patient and try to let the temptation go away. When CHRISTMAS eve came I feel greatful I made it this long with patients because I am just like my parents and cant wait for anything that takes month. Then it comes around as slow as possible and then leave quicker, then I could think how fast it left. Just like the saying time file sometime having fan, even though waiting can be hard, the anticipation ultimately makes the holiday that much more special and appreciated.
862	18793	7	3	Once when I was a little boy, about seven years old I was extremely patient about an Avatar toy I wanted. Ever since Avatar The Last Airbender was on television and in stories now I was crazy about them and I still am today the powerful Avatar the only person in the Avatar world who can master all four element Air, Water, Earth, Fire. Now I can write you a whole entire book about the Avatar. So I saw a Avatar had set on t.v. so I asked my mom could she buy it. And she said when I get the money, but until then no. so of course I was upset. So I was waiting counting until the days went buy. Then final that very Friday came, and you know what that means. “Payday Friday” the Friday has arrived the Friday I get my toy but I didn`t know that she only got two hundred dollars so I had to wait another week. I was so upset that I ran up steair and locked my door and cryed myself to sleep. My birthday was coming up. I was so upset that I forgot all about the Friday and when my birthday was here can guess whatÖ? I finally got the best of all. The Avatar and my mom said that all that patients you did got what you wanted, proving that patience truly does pay off in the end.
863	18794	7	3	Patient is like you're waiting for something and you don't complain it's taking too long, and you're just sitting there waiting quietly. This often involves accepting delays without getting frustrated. One time I was waiting to go get a check-up at the doctor's, and you're sitting there quiet reading a magazine and just sitting there. That's an example of being patient, demonstrating a calm and tolerant demeanor despite the wait.
864	18795	7	3	"One day a kid was going to school. Mark was going to turn in a paper for math he did. During English class, Mark was doing a chapter sketch. His teacher called him over. The teacher said, ""Do you have a page of a story that was due a month ago?"" Mark said, ""No."" The teacher asked, ""Why?"" The kid said, ""Because I have been going to a basketball tournament."" The teacher said, ""You have until tomorrow."" The next day the kid is at English class. Mark said, ""I'm sorry I don't have my paper."" The teacher asked, ""Why?"" ""Because my grampa died."" The teacher said, ""Okay, tomorrow."" The kid got his paper done, showing that persistence can eventually lead to success."
865	18796	7	3	I have been patient lots of times in my life but this time was really hard to be patient because I was so exited about building. Left in my reach we had been planning it for a while now and we started on a Friday, October 25th after school was over we got like half of it done that day but there we couldn’t work on it again for a week because my brother, sister, dad, and mom all had appointments or meetings so I had to wait a week just to work on it again. It was really hard to be patient this time though because I had been waiting to do this for a while. After a week finally passed, it seemed like a month but now I could finish my work and I was so exited. A few days later we finally finished the walls painted a blue and gold for U of M and my loft as all we had to do was put my dad in my loft then it was ready to sleep in. I was so happy that we had finally finished my room and I could sleep in it.
866	18797	7	3	One time that I was patient was when I was saving up to buy a game. The name of the game was Halo Reach. I had to wait 4 weeks until I could get it. But I was patient by waiting the whole time and not asking over and over again. I knew it would be worth the wait, and I am glad I practiced patience.
867	18798	7	3	"The Blackwood Stables a few days after Seabiscuit began to run, Penny, a small, anxious, chestnut room Penny saw her mother plowing a large oval and covering it with dirt looked like dust. ""What's mother doing, Dad?"" asked a very curious Penny. ""She's plowing."" explained Joseph, the young horses' trainer. ""She's going to be in a race called the Breeders Cup next year and that's how Seabiscuit will practice."" I want to race! ""hollered Penny excitedly ""Patience my darling, you're not even a filly!"" explained Joseph, conclusively. And so Penny waited patiently for weeks. When Seabiscuit could Seabiscuit ran the track at night. Seabiscuit counted her times and Seabiscuit got faster and stronger. Two years later Penny was the champion reached for three years in a raw. ""Joseph was right!"" Seabiscuit claimed ""Patience is the key! Therefore, with patience and dedication, success can be achieved, as demonstrated by Penny's journey."

The next morning I woke up at six am to catch the bus to school during my classes all I could think about was the scooters. Patience - patience, I thought. After school I would go to close country intill 5pm when my parents would pick me up. Five business days finaly come ìI cant wait any moreî I yelled. After close country my mom drove me home and I sprinted to the main box ìdarm it!î I said ìUnfortunately yeah the website tried to charge our credit card extra money so we had to cancel it. ìNo! @CAPS5î my mom said ìlets buy you a new oneî ìOkay!î The scooter finaly arrives three buisness days later. ìItís about timeî I said with joy, relieved that the replacement purchase finally came through after the initial disappointment.
869	18800	7	3	One time when I was at Cedar Point Amusement Park I had to wait about 3 hours to go on the Top Thrill Dragster. I was so patient because it was my first time ever going on the dragster. Me and my dad were waiting and waiting. When we got to the front of the line I was so scared that I was going to pee my pants. When we got on the rollercoaster I said that I don’t want to go. So my dad asked if my son could get off the rollercoaster and they said when you get on there is no getting off. So I had to ride it and when I did I wanted to go on it over and over again. Even though it was a 17 second ride it was the best thing that I had ever waited for in my life so far. That is the time when I had to be patient to get something that I really wanted.

871	18802	7	3	Do you know someone who is patient? I do, my mom is very patient with us kids. When I just blow my top, my mom is still cool. All the time my little brother makes me so mad that I can't stand it. But she barely ever is like that. Even when my grandma died, she stayed cool. Two of my aunts just broke down that week, but they're good now. Everyday things don't make her very uptight. When my sister makes her mad, she always regrets it. I want to punch her when she makes Mom mad because it wears off on me; she's cranky. So as you can see, my mom keeps her patience so well, and I really admire that about her.
872	18803	7	3	My friend was waiting for @NUM1 hours to talk to my dad, my dad was busy fixing his @CAPS1. He was waiting, waiting, and waiting till he fixed it. I was wondering what the question was my friend wanted to ask. He was sitting inside, watching tv waiting for him to be finished. Then my dad was done so my friends asked if we could ride the @CAPS1. My dad said yes. My friend was being patient, and his patience was rewarded with a fun ride.
873	18804	7	3	Being patient is a good thing because if you are, you can better navigate rough times in life. Patient people can cope by bringing something to do. They could wait there for three hours and not be heard, remaining calm. There are some people that can't wait there for three hours. There are some people that can't wait for even ten minutes. These people get mad at that and they will just give up easily. But after all of those people that can and can't, people can't quit if they truly want something. People wait there for one hour and will blow up in frustration. And then there are people that can't do it easily, but they persevere. So all you have to do is find anything to do if you can't do it naturally, to help pass the time and ease the frustration. Ultimately, cultivating patience, even with distractions, is essential for achieving goals and overcoming obstacles.
874	18805	7	3	“Are we there yet?” I keep asking over and over. “But almost,” Dad replied. Today we are going to Six Flags adventures and I am so excited! After I asked my Dad when we would be there, about 20 minutes later we finally arrived at Six Flags adventures! The line to get are tickets was long but not to long. Once we get them we went to go look for a lock to put all of are stuff in! The line far that wasn’t long so we did that fast! We were now all hungry, so we went to go eat! The time we got into the restaurant, the lines to order were very long! Ok, so now that we are all done eating, it was time to ride some awesome rides! “Oh, man!” is what I would get saying when the lines to the rides were super long! But so far I have been a very patient girl! But, ok say I had to go change my clothes to go into the water park and change back or go to the restroom man these lines were super long too! Now that the day is almost done, and the park will be closing, my family and I arent into the gift shop: we were in there for about 20 minutes waking around. When we were done and we were ready to check out, the check out line wasn’t long at all! Finally, there was a line that wasn’t long! All that day I was a very patient girl! Between everything that went on throughout that day, I am proud of myself for being so patient.
875	18806	7	3	A time that I was patient was when my friend and I were at Disney World vacation. I was having a blast. My family didnít come because they donít like roller coasters. We dicided to ride the Expedition Everest, it looked like a really long wait. After an hour and a half of waiting it started to rain. It was just sprinkling at first but it was enough so they had to close some rides, including the Expedition Everest. We really wanted to ride so we waited until the rain stopped. After another hour the people left so we were at the front of the line. My friend and I got front row seats and had a lot of fun. It was worth waiting two and a half hours for it and we even went on it twice, making the experience even more worthwhile.
876	18807	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was in @NUM1 grade and I had to wait to play football till this year. I was patient because I waited for a long time without doing anything, knowing I wasn't old enough yet to join the team and participate, which required a great deal of restraint on my part. Therefore, my patience paid off.
877	18808	7	3	Do you know what patience is? Have you ever been patient? Well being patient is something you need in life. Iím going to tell you a little bit about being patient. Patience is a big thing. Patience is something we need for when we go shoping, or when your in the car. You must be patient when you are in the car because if you donít then you could get into an accident. Patience has many qualities. For example, it shows respect for others' time. If you arenít patient when you are place then you are going to become annoying. When their are long lines or something and your not patient people are going to get very frustrated and annoyed with you. Being patient is important. If you have kids your impatient, then your going to teach your kids to be impatient. Thatís not a good thing. Ultimately, learning patience benefits not only yourself but also those around you. As you can see I have told you as much as I can about patience.
878	18809	7	3	A time when my parents were patient was when I wouldn’t eat dinner. One night my dad made chop suey for dinner. I didn’t like chop suey at all! The smell of it almost made me gag! But, my dad loves chop suey so he makes it all the time! We all sat down to eat. I ate a potato and my dad gave me a whole scoop of chop suey. “I’m not gonna eat it.” I said. “I hate chop suey.” My dad sat patiently at the table waiting for me to eat what was on my plate. “Fine,” I said, “ I’ll eat the meat out of it.” I took the fork and stirred the chop suey around looking for the meat. After I ate all the meat. I said “Now I am done.” My dad laughed at my stubbornness. “Eat the vegetables out of it.” My dad said. “No way! I hate celery!” I whined. After a half hour of the war of wills my dad won. I really wanted to leave the table but he was very patient with me. I ended up eating the chop suey and leaving the table. That was when my dad was very patient, showing his commitment to me even when I was being difficult.
879	18810	7	3	??? One time when I was being very patient was when I was with my grandparents. We were suppose to be going to @CAPS1 adventures and my grandma said she wanted me and my cousins to be ready by a certain time so we wouldnít get there that late. So the next day we get to her house right there at @NUM1 like she said and we had found out that she had over slept and we all looked at one another because we new that it was going to take a long time. So I said thatís ok we can wait and we all went into her house and waited until every one was ready. So as we were walking out I noticed that my grandparent were caring suitcases and I said why do you guys carring suitcases my grandma said that we were going to spend the night in a hotel so we would be even closer to @CAPS1 adventures. So she drove all of us back to our houses to get our tooth brushes and @NUM2 extra pair of clothes after that we were as our way to the hotel and ready to go to @CAPS1 adventure that next morning. Even though we were suppose to go earlier, I believe that being patient and flexible ultimately contributed to a more enjoyable and memorable experience.
880	18811	7	3	One time I had to be patient was when I went to Oklahoma with my mom, dad, uncle Bob, my sister and my grandma. My cousins live in Oklahoma so we were going to visit them. We had to drive 12 hours in a small col balt with five people. We had to be patient on the car ride there because we were all really exited. When I first found out that we were going I was really happy and I knew I would have to be very patient. We had to drive the hole day then get a motel to stay in. Then we had to drive till about 10:00 am and we were fanaly 10:00 am my great aunts lake house, my my grandmas sister. It was so fun geting to see them again! But then came more patients on the trip home. We were all sad to leave but we had a great time. The trip home felt shorter than the trip there but still long. When we got home everyone of us was tired and tired of being in the car but we were glad we didnít have to drive anothe hour home like my grandma. That was a time when I had to be patient, and it taught me the value of enduring discomfort for a worthwhile experience.
881	18812	7	3	It was night time, and all of a sudden, a wire from my braces popped out of place. It was sticking out, poking the inside of my cheek, and there was nothing I could do about it immediately. I had to wait for my mom to get home to help me, but I was scared and uncomfortable, yet I was patient. I kept waiting, distracting myself with a book, until my mom finally got there, and we carefully got the wire out. There, in that moment, my mom told me I was patient, and I realized she was right.
882	18813	7	3	Be patient a day when I had to be patient was on my birthday and I was waiting for my daddy to give me some money so I can go to the arcade. I waited all day until 10 o'clock and when he finally agreed I got 20 dollars and it was worth being patient because if I would have kept wishing him he would probably have lowered the price and it would have been my fault so in far last stone wish my mother to pick me up from football practice and the rain we waited for a while and I was just I was the last are those my envelopes that are wet and I was up under a tree when it was raining and lightning so I couldn't put in my helmet as it would have caged me held interest lightning is an illusion being patient is indeed worth it. Was your dad showing how that feels or acts besides she wouldn't have one rushing me until their luck around and let them wish cause if its my cause its my chance to turn around so if you that type by situation just don't rush for future success.
883	18814	7	3	What exactly is patience? Patience means to wait calmly for something. One of the times that I had to be patient was when I wanted my ears pierced. I tried everything for four years, begging, pleading, even cleaning, but it still didn’t work. My mom says I have to be 13 before I can get my ears pierced. So instead of annoying her, I sat back and stayed patient. By doing that, I got my mom to change the age to twelve. So all I have to do is wait until soccer is finished and find a place and she’ll take me. Patience really helps in many different ways, and I encourage you to try being patient when you want something, because it will all fall into place eventually.
884	18815	7	3	Sometimes being patient is hard. I’ve had to do it a lot of times. One time in particular was very life changing for me. It was my favorite day of the year, my birthday. I’ve always waited for this day long and hard every year until it comes. I got up really early to see my presents, their were none. My mom was just watching TV like nothing was important and I said to her, “Mom.” The response she said back was “Honey, why are you up this early?” I just went back to sleep. When I woke up again, nothing happened. So I just waited patiently in my room until something happened, nothing. Eventually I went downstairs and played video games until 1 pm, just waiting for someone to say “happy birthday,” yet, nothing. So I just acted like it was a normal day until 6 pm when I went in the basement. There was a surprise birthday party for me with presents and friends and everything. I was glad I was patient; I got a good party and now I’m patient every day, understanding that good things often come to those who wait.
885	18816	7	3	Last @DATE1 I went with some friends to the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, a venue I had never been to before. The @ORGANIZATION1 is about christan rock music that I really enjoy. The part that sticks out the most is seeing my favorite christan rock band, @CAPS2. They played new songs and had a lot of guitar solos. I bought one of their cd's and it was amazing. The past that made me patient was the line that my friend @PERSON1 and I had to wait in to get autographs. It almost streched out the gate into the parking lot. The bad part was we were pretty much at the end of it. Even though the wait was long the girl behind us was super nice so we ended up making a new friend. When we finally got to the front the wait was all worth it. All of the band members were super nice and I gave there lead singer @CAPS3 my lucky braclet. Giving up something special and waiting a long time definitely made the experience memorable, and that was the time I was patient.
886	18817	7	3	One time there were two twin chipmunks, there names were Peter and Peter always had patience A.J not so much. One day it was sunny with a cool breeze. A.J. decided he wanted to go on a trip with Peter. So they packed up there camping gear and headed farther into the woods it was around dusk when they reached were they wanted to be. So they tried to build a fire, A.J. started gathering firewood and tried to start the fire how there mom and dad had taught them. As l said in the first part A.J. has no patience so he kept on trying but after awile he stopped he would hit the rocks together once and it wouldnít start so Peter tried in one minute he got it started. A.J. didnít care he got the acorns and started cookin. But every time heíd only leave them on for five seconds so he tried and tried finally he just stopped well it Peter five minutes, A.J. was really mad now so they went to bed. When Peter woke up in the morning he found A.J. cooking breakfast. A.J finally learned to be patient, realizing that some things take time and effort to perfect.
887	18818	7	3	My head was in the sky. It was mine. The ticket I'd been dying for was actually mine. I was going to see three days @ORGANIZATION1 and breaking @CAPS1 with my own eyes! Only one thing was bad. The concert was @NUM1 days away. So soon but oh so far. For three days (no fun intended!) I whined and whined, but only in my head. I didn't want to annoy my father after all he did just spend loads of money on me! After those three days, I was okay. I still promised myself I wouldn't break my rule of no complaining. I couldn't tell if the week went fast or slow. All I knew was I couldn't wait any longer. Soon enough, it was @DATE1, and my two favorite bands and a band I loved almost as much called flipleaf, would be in @LOCATION1 tonight. The day crawled. I wanted to explode with excitement. All I could think was what would happen later today. Every second my heart pounced until I got in my dads car at @NUM2. cool clothes, crack, tickets? Check. @NUM1 days of no complaining? CHECK! We listened to the three bands we would be seeing all the way to @LOCATION1. I thought my heart had gone back to normal but with each beat of life along they hear got louder and louder and almost in time to the pound of their bass drums. Passed a limo with one window open, I swear I saw the singer of breaking @CAPS1.(@CAPS3 @CAPS4) feiceps. I saw the limo just as we entered @LOCATION1. No more than ten minutes later we pulled into the parking building for the @PERSON1. I got a glimpse of the long line of people waiting to get in. I reached into my bottle of patience, and pulled out the small scraps of what I had left. The enormous tunnels the lines were gray and dras. We had to walk for a mile to get to the end of the line, and the line sacrues of, if ???? up of snails, but before I knew it, I was in. I had yet to complain. I was proud of my patience, especially considering how long the walk was.
888	18819	7	3	One day I was being really patient. I was babysitting and it was going great until the kid started fighting! It was my two little brothers of course. They were hitting, kicking, and the youngest one was biting; so I told them to stop. They did for a while and then started again over a toy. So I went back to their room and told them to stop again. So they stopped for good until my little brother @PERSON1 started to copy everything everybody said, so I said stop or you’ll go to your room. So he stopped and everybody was good for the rest of the night until mom and dad got home; now that’s a whole different story. So that's the time I was patient with my little brothers. It took all my self-control, but I managed to keep the peace, at least until our parents arrived.
889	18820	7	3	A time when I was very patient was last year. My auntie said she was taking me to a basketball game. So the next day when I woke up, I woke up too early. My aunt never told me what time she was coming. So I got ready at 8 am. So at 10 am I called her but she didn't answer. So then I just was watching tv and playing my game. Then around 1 pm my aunt called back saying she had to go to the store, so now my frustration started to build up. I wanted to call her back and ask her questions like where are you going and how long you're gonna be gone, but I was trying to be patient. Now at 4 my mom said lets go! Now I was really getting mad because I was not expecting to leave with my mom. So me and my mom got home at around 6 pm. Now I was real angry because she had not even called since we was gone. So I called her and she said she coming down the street. I was so happy so later on that day I had fun with my cousins and aunt. Even though it took a long time, I was happy I practiced patience and got to enjoy the day with them.
890	18821	7	3	ìMom, when can we open presents?î I asked. ìAfter we get back from churchî she replied. It was our typical Christmas eve schedual, make Christmas eve dinner all day, go to the Christmas eve service , have grand parents for dinner than all the kids get to open one present than go to bed for about one hour get up , and open more presents. Amen,î our pastor concluded the service ìCan we go now, Mom?î I blubbered ìYes,î she said. After we ate dinner I felt like I had ants in my pants, I was so excited. time seemed to go by so slow I was 7 years old before my grand parents left. Finally we were all gathered around the Christmas tree after I was about to open my present. All it was was a sleeping bag than my dad said,î you can all sleep on the floor in living room, but be sure you go to bed.î After I was laying on the floor, while my sister was sound asleep, I was thinking, I wonder what Iëll get for Christmas. I eventually fell asleep. The next morning at 6:00 AM. I jumped out of bed woke my sister up and ran into my parents room to wake them up. I was thinking finally we get to open presents. That was a time where I had to be very patient. But it was all paid off in the end, making the anticipation and the joy of Christmas morning even sweeter.
891	18822	7	3	Patience is about waiting and having what for stuff you want. Like if I want anything, patience is that you have to wait before you get it. So patience, it means that you have to wait in a good manner. Patience is really about understanding that some things take time and reacting calmly while you wait.
892	18823	7	3	Once I was taking a test; it was really long. I was done early. Me and my friend waited a long time. They gave us two and half hours for the test. I finished with an hour and a half to spare. My friend finished within five minutes of me. I read a book but finished it. I had to wait another hour to actually do something. It was a good reminder to bring something to do while practicing patience. If you have nothing to do, just wait quietly. Patience is a good quality to cultivate. Patience can be used by waiting for something or someone, and it certainly helped me get through that long wait after the test.
893	18824	7	3	One day I asked my parents if I could buy this game that I wanted and this game that I wanted and they asked me how much is it? I said that I did not know how much it is. So he said that we would go to the store and see how much it is. When we got to there we found out that it was $60 and I said can I buy it and he said maybe after a while I started begging he still said NO! when I went home I went to sleep the next morning I was at home watching TV.V and I saw this commercially about the game and it said that the game was still $60 so I felt disappointed. When we went to the mall me saw that it was $45 and so I finally got to buy it, making me very happy that I could finally play the game.
894	18825	7	3	Everyone is patient one time in their life. I remember I was very patient one day when I was ten years old. It was all because of popcorn. A small little popcorn cernal cought in my throught .That was an aginizing day, but I was very patient. One day, about two year ago when I was ten years old swallowed a popcorn cernal after going to a movie. I remember eating one last piece of popcorn from the popcorn box then trowing the box away. Well right as soon as I and walked out the door and eaten my popcorn peice did it start to bother me. My mom and I waked in the target nearby to get some supplies and do some errands. I started to get really thirsty because of the popcorn cernal. I asked my mom if she would buy me a drink because of how thirsty was but she said she only had a credit card. That meant she could by her things but she could not buy a pop. I understood. So I just tried not to think about it. This was very hard. Soon we pulled up to our next errand, the bank. My mom needed to get some money to pay off my tennis instructer. I asked her if she could please hurry because the popcorn cernal and lack of thirst was hurting me. She said she was going as fast as she could and that we were only a few minutes away from home. I knew that we were more like fifteen minutes away not just a few, but I didn't argue. The cernal and thirst was starting to get to me. It felt like it had been three hours but it had only been fifteen minutes by the time we finally got home. I threw the door open and ran inside to get some water. I ran, and opened the fridge opened a bottle of water and hugged the whole thing down. Then I went outside to help my mom bring in the supplies and things then drank more water with a smile. In conclusion we all learnt to be patient sometimes. I was patient to get home and drink some water. I am always patient and when it pays off I am always happy.
895	18826	7	3	"There have only been a few times in my life where I really had to be patient, but the one I can remember the most was when I was at the JFK airport. My parents and I were waiting at our terminal, for our flight to Cancun. I'd been waiting about 30 minutes when I heard an announcement. ""Something has gone wrong with the plane but it should be fixed in about an hour."" I eventually found out that the back door had been slammed too hard, which broke one of the parts. They needed a new part so the emergency slide would work. An hour of waiting sounded okay. But then there was another announcement ""I'm sorry, but we cannot get the part right away. The wait will be a minimum of three hours."" That sounded worse, but I kept calm. My mom was well freaking out. Three hours had passed, then four. Then five. My laptop and my iPod ran out of power so I was just fiddling with my fingers. Then I heard ""It turns out we cannot get the part until tomorrow morning."" Then a big ""ughhh"" swept across the terminal. But luckily, we received a free night at a hotel until the flight. The wait was exhausting, but we all had patience, so we got through it."
896	18827	7	3	"A couple of days ago when I was at cheer a lot of drama was going around our team; it was fifteen days before competition and everybody was yelling at someone. There was so much yelling and talking back to our coaches that no one could understand what we were supposed to be doing. The side I was on for the pom routine in our second formation wasn't in a diagonal line like we were supposed to be and wasn't getting to the kickline in time because the people on the other side were pushing us, so we had to walk a lot farther than they did. @LOCATION1, one of our coach's daughters, was yelling at the side I'm on for not getting to the kickline in time even though she's the one pushing us farther down, so we can't get there. Then she started yelling at @PERSON1, saying it was all her fault, so then @PERSON2 said to @LOCATION1, ""@LOCATION1, stop blaming everyone else for everything; you aren't perfect at everything either, and you're the ones pushing us over, so we can't get to the kickline in time."" @LOCATION1 didn't know what to say, but she said, ""@CAPS1 up @PERSON2! That isn't true,"" even though you could tell that she knew it was true because next time we did the kickline, she didn't move closer to the center; she moved farther, and @PERSON3 got to her spot not really on time but just a couple of seconds after she was supposed to. I thought that @PERSON2 was being loyal to @PERSON1, even though @PERSON1 might not be one of her best friends; they still are friends, just not best friends, demonstrating a sense of team unity despite the prevailing drama."
897	18829	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I wanted to go outside and my sister wanted to go but she wasn't ready. She had to get her hair done and some clothes on. I waited patiently and didn't say nothing. I didn't want to but I did. I wanted to go outside and my sister wanted to go so I waited on her. I walked out the door quietly then my sister yelled I want to go wait. I went back in the house and waited for her to first find some clothes, so she went upstairs and found some. She put her clothes on then she had to look for her shoes. She searched the whole house and then found them in the corner near the living room couch. So we were about to walk out and I said girl what's wrong with your hair, suprised. She felt her head and said o I forgot. So we went back in the house and I tried to put her hair in a ponytail and it wouldn't fit. So I let her do something and she couldn't. So I parted her hair and put it in two ponytails. Then we went outside to finally play. That's a time when I waited paintently on my sister. It was hard, but I managed to be patient.
898	18830	7	3	When I was getting ready to leave my uncle's ranch, I was waiting patiently for my dad to get back so he could help my brother put the hay bales on to the trailer. It has been two hours and my dad has not come back yet. I was having a difficult time taking my saddle off the trailer because it was too heavy, and my dad was still riding his horse. When my dad got back, my brother went to go ride his horse. I was having a very difficult time trying to get everything together and leave, but finally my mom and sister wanted to leave too, so they finally helped me, allowing us to finally head home.
899	18831	7	3	It was July 4th in my hometown, Centerville, Ohio. My cousin, Ashley, and I were going up the street to the carnival they were having. When we got there it was raining and only one of the rides was open. So we sat around till all of them were open. We went on all of them, but I wouldn’t go on it. It was called the freax out. There were lights flickering and loud music. We were in the line for it but I got out. Ashley said ìwhy did you get of line?î ìI am scared.î ì I want to go on it though.î ìAshley can you wait till later?î I said. We waited for a hour. I sat on the bench and Ashley saidî Ashley can we go on the ride?î ìOkay Ashley we canî my heart was pounding so hard I could hear it. That’s when Ashley said ìI can wait.î ìOkay lets get it over with.î Ashley was nice to wait till I was ready to go on. In conclusion my cousin is the nicest for waiting. On the up side I love that ride now.
900	18832	7	3	"Have you ever been patient before? Well I have. I was sitting there in a nice warm and cozy seat, exhausted, dozing off, waiting for them to say the name @PERSON1. It kept going through my mind: @PERSON1, @PERSON1, @PERSON1, but nothing ever happened so I just sat there waiting patiently. My mom was sitting next to me reading an Avon magazine that she had picked up from the small, round wooden table centered right in the middle of the silent orthodontist office. I kept asking myself things like: I wonder what they're gonna do today? I wonder if I'll get my expander off, or what about my top braces? Then I started to stare at the office ladies typing away on their computers. The sound of metal tools was ringing in my ear, coming from the back room. A girl walked out: ""@CAPS1!"" I was excited and nervous at the same time, but I was proud because I had sat there the whole time patiently, demonstrating a level of composure that made the eventual reward all the more satisfying."
901	18833	7	3	"""Patience,"" I said. We were on our way to the big city, to go to a very special baseball game. Can you guess what game? It's the ""New York"" tigers, at the Yankee stadium. ""I"" was so excited, it was the first time I had ever been in New York. ""How"" much longer till I get there?"" I asked. ""About one hour, why?"" my mom replied. ""Because it's so boring sitting here for four hours straight."" ""I know, but you have to be patient."" ""Ugh,"" I thought in my head. ""I wonder how I could be patient for?"" I just thought for a moment. Then a minute, then boom! I was out cold: for two hours I slept. Then I woke up just as I hit traffic. I asked ""are we there yet,"" ""hope"" my dad said. So I sat there waiting patiently. About five min later I asked can we turn on the radio. ""Sure"" my mom said. I sat there for about ten in. Then I finally started moving, hardest not to be annoying, what I was going to do when I got to game. I was thinking maybe I’ll get a bit expensive, but by the time I thought anything else I heard ""were here!"" ""Yes!"" I screamed. So we got out of the and walked about a quarter of a mile to the ticket booth. As we were walking up I thought ""I guess all it does take is patience."""
902	18834	7	3	Two weeks ago me and my family went to Six Flags for Fright Fest. The lines were going to be long and I would never be patient; I hate being patient. We went on Batman in Gotham City first; the lines were only ten minutes. Then Superman, that one was a little longer. Me and my sister got permission to leave and go on the Riper. Then Pirata, a wooden rollercoaster that goes off the track a lot; we waited 5 minutes between each stop. We finally got to where we saw the coaster people with these flash passes kept coming. The flash pass takes you to the front of the line. When we finally got to the front of the line my patience was GONE. The roller coaster went off the track. It was a 2 mile coaster but a fun one. That is the time I was not patient.
903	18835	7	3	One day, last year I had to be really patient. My mom had told the family that we would be going to Six Flags soon. I was filled with excitement and I couldn't wait so I asked her when and she said she didn't know yet. This made me upset because last time she said that about going somewhere, we ended up not going. The only thing that I knew for sure was that it had to be on a Saturday because she works during the week. I was just happy that school was finally out so I didn't have to worry about homework. So I waited until Wednesday and then asked my mom if we could go that Saturday. She said no because we would have to plan it more and that we couldn't randomly go one Saturday. That week I bugged her every day until she finally started planning it. The first thing she did was look at her work schedule to make sure she didn't have any meetings or projects for the coming Saturday. My stomach dropped when she told me that she had stuff to do so she kept looking at her schedule. The next free Saturday she had was two weeks away. I was okay with it though because that's better than nothing. Throughout the next two weeks I saved money up for Six Flags. When the two weeks were finally over I had about $100 saved up and I was practically bouncing off the walls because I was so excited. I think that was the most patient I have ever been, and the anticipation made the trip even more enjoyable.
904	18836	7	3	Patience is waiting without complaining to do something you want to do. When I was at an outdoor mall with my mom, two older sisters, younger brother, niece, and dog, I waited patiently to go to the Apple store to try out the iPad. When I did, I realized that the iPad is awesome! Afterward, we went to get ice cream. My little brother got a root beer flavored slushie, my niece, dog, and I got vanilla ice cream. After I finished my ice cream I put the container on the ground and let my dog lick the rest from the bottom. We had spent three hours there! What a surprise! Then we went home, concluding a fun-filled family outing.
905	18837	7	3	One time when @PERSON1 was patient was when @CAPS1 & I taught him how to pitch. @PERSON1 easily developed a nice windup and delivery, but the arm angle was off. But this didn’t stop him. @CAPS1 asked him if he wanted to stop, but @PERSON1 said “no!” As time went on, @PERSON1 started to get better and better. He now enjoys throwing a @NUM1 mph fastball at a catcher. On days that he’s inaccurate, he doesn’t give up; he keeps trying and doesn’t whine. @PERSON1 is now the number two starter in the rotation, thanks to some serious patience.
906	18839	7	3	ìBe patient! It will be here soon donít worry,î she said. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. Well over these few days (which feels like cons) I have not been this so called ìpatientî person. Halloween was coming in a few days and my costume still didnít come in the mail. Iíve been waiting and waiting but it takes too long! For the fith time I watch the little red hand on the clock go around. They said it would come today but it didnít. ìIíve been sitting here since ten oíclock where is the delivery track!î I scream. Then I glance at the clock again. What! It feels like an hour! How can someone bear to wait this long! ìIt is comingî I say to myself. A few hours later I see a little white delivery-service truck wander along the street. (Oh thatís it!) I stop to gaze. Nope it keeps going past. I sigh then drag myself down the steps.î No!î I sob in agony, ì why does this feeling consume me like this?î I stroll to the kitchen and a brown box is on the counter. I get giddy as I take giant sneaky steps to it. ìIt is here! It is here!î I yelp as I hop up and down. Finally! It had been a long wait, but the costume finally arrived, relieving my impatience and ensuring a happy Halloween.
907	18840	7	3	"One of the many times I was patient was when my mom, my dad and I went to a restaurant. We ordered our food and found a table. We were sitting there waiting for the food. I asked my mom, ""How much longer is it going to take?"" Dad said ""you have to be patient and wait"". And then a little after that our food was done. It was totally worth it."
908	18841	7	3	About three or four times I was patient; it was when I was five and it was my birthday and my grandmother when shopping for me I had to be patient and wait for her to come back with my presents. The other time was when I was @NUM1 and it was @CAPS1 day and I was up super early and ready to be patient, once again and wait for my dad to wake up so I can open my presents. Then the other time was when my friend had to do something so I had to be patient again so, I waited till he got back. This will conclude my being patient paper.
909	18842	7	3	"The time I was patient was when MOM went to FLORIDA ""mom!"" I exclaimed. ""LET's go I want to leave I'm packed and ready to go."" MY mom and I were in the house packing everyone's things. It was a beutiful DAY in ORLANDO and it was also MY step dad's birthday. ""YOU need to be patient okay, MOM have a long drive, do you have everything you need."" DAD got me there. I had to get, coloring materials, the portable DVD player, ect. I had ASKED and ASKED what else MOM needed until MY stomach growled it sounded like a bear protecting it's cubs, fierce, and starving. Then I remembered, ding, I thought in MY head, food thats what I need to get. So I rushed into the kitchen like a race car trying to win a race. I packed turkey sandwiches, pb&j sandwiches, chips. Saltandvinager, sour crean and onion (caross) and jolepenyo ceddar(yum). Now I have everything I thought, ""of MOM go."" FINALLY MY mom and again I rushed out the door ""got the address,"" asked MY father."" YES YOU I got it."" THEN when MOM started to go MY sister fell asleep. DAD was sleeping lik arock the whole way there although, I don't think rocks shore. after 10 hours of being awake in the car I thought maybe I should try to sleep, but the excitment was rushing so fast I could feel it then I fell asleep. I thought I would be able to stay awake the whole way but I was marked impossible. Finally MY step father yelled ""wake up!!"" I was so tierd when I woke up, "" are MOM there yet, first thing that came out of MY mouth ""yeah"" and, of course, the first things I did was jump up and out of the care! ""HEY!"" MY mother shouted. I paused as if I was a charactor in a video game and the player press pause."" NOW take in some off the bags."" ""UGH"" I said with a scowse on MY face. ""REMEMBER youhave to be patient"" as I took in the bag there it was to condo of MY dreams and the first thing I did was sleep, showing that even with all the excitement, patience and rest were key to enjoying the vacation."
910	18843	7	3	Being patient isnít always that easy, in fact, last year was one year where I had to sit in a car with @NUM1 four rude, screaming and crying kids for @NUM2 six hours. Last year I was so excited to see my great @CAPS3 Aunt davn in???. with my grandpa. My @CAPS1 Grandpa pa is fan bag to talk to, @CAPS2 but later than I found out my @NUM1 four younger cousins were coming. This was going to be a long car ride. We packed our things in the car. I brought my ipod and a book, @CAPS2 but my cousins brought??? loud noisy and flossy toys they bot just for the ride. As we started heading for @LOCATION1 Florida I turned my ipod on and found out it only had @PERCENT1 5% battery left. Half way there I was almost dad of borden, @CAPS2 but the kids were just settling down. When I was sure they were asleep I decided to join them. WACK! I auske is a sobbery slap to the face, ìwere hereî my cousin enchoired, finally I said to myself as I was still waking up with a sore, and stiff neck. After we were done visiting my @CAPS3 Aunt, it was about @NUM4 4 hrs and my cousins were all asleep again and I knew it was going to be a nice ride home, and I was thankful for the quiet.
911	18844	7	3	"There was a day when I was patient and I was so nice, but this girl was so annoying. She was getting on my nerves because she kept pushing me and hitting me. So, I just let her go in front of me. We were in line at the cafeteria, and a lot of people were ready for lunch. A cafeteria lady said, ""Stop pushing her!"" Then we were in class, and so I raised my hand. The girl said, ""Be patient."" I said, ""I am patient, so shut up, please."" She didn't shut up, so I raised my hand another time, and the teacher called on me. She got mad at me, showing how my patience was tested and ultimately rewarded, despite her attempts to provoke me."
912	18845	7	3	I am going to write about the time that I was patient. One day, after my family and I came back from church, I asked my mom if she could make breakfast, but she would not answer me because she was on the phone with my grandma and my grandma talks a lot. It was so agonizing. For example, I kept pacing back and forth but then I just sat down on the couch. After an hour of patience, my mom and grandma finally said goodbye and hung up the phone, and I finally got my breakfast, a plate of scrambled eggs. The waiting was difficult, but in the end, I learned that sometimes patience is the only option.
913	18847	7	3	One some day, it was about 7:00 AM. My mom woke me, my brother, and dad to get ready. I don’t know what we was getting ready for, but we get on the road as soon as we could. I fell back to sleep in the car when we were on the highway. I woke up from a big SQUEAL on the breaks and when I looked up, we were in a long line of cars, “where are we?” I ask. “Six Flags,” REPLIED my brother. I could hear impatience people all around me. They were thinking, screaming, and yelling while people tried to pay their way into the park. It seemed like we were moving faster than MOST of the fast people, and we was one of the first people to get in first. That was the MOST impatience group of people I’d ever seen.
914	18848	7	3	Pg 1: OMG her crying! I just wanted to get out of the car and walk home. There were 7 of us in a suburban that were all smushed together! So we couldnt even more our arms I felt like I was locked in jail with chains on me. It was 3 oclock in the morning and I saw a big sign that read welcome to Florida. So at that point we only had a hour or so left I was so excited. We finally made it to our destination key wrap. It was the longest trip of my life! But I tryed my hardest to stay patient and wait. But in the long run I realized I didnt are and I had a whole weekend of waves and a temperature of 90∞F degrees. When I thought about how long it was to get here I didnt even want to think about how long it is going to take to get home! But how I know I have the patients to go home!
915	18849	7	3	A time when I was patient was just yesterday. I had just finished part one of the test and I was very anxious and I wanted to get up and move around, but were taking the PSAT so I could not. Instead I entertained myself in any way I could such as pretending I was a singer writing running songs through my head repeatedly, even twiddling my thumbs! So finally she let us get up and talk. I was sitting next to some of my friends so I just talked to them. Somehow we got into talking about Dungeons and Dragons, they kept asking me what class they would be and what they were. Anyway I kept trying to talk but I kept getting interrupted so I just relaxed and waited for my turn. Finally it was my turn to talk, but we had to go to lunch so I never did get to say what mine was. This experience truly highlighted my ability to remain calm and composed, even when faced with anticipation and the desire to express myself, demonstrating a time when I was patient.
916	18851	7	3	"Have you ever got annoyed because someone kept saying be patient? I have and I'm gonna tell you about the time I was patient. One time I was on my way to Mexico, the plane ride wasn't as bad as what I'm gonna tell you. When I got to Tijuana I had to pass through Tijuana's border it was hot!!! I think temperature hit 100? I had to wait in this small room with about 50 people, and they had no A. C. All of us were waiting for the bus to come, and after 4 hours a bus arrived. I were getting on as about 20 people came barging in front, so I miss that bus. Then I waited again for a bus the after 4 hours a bus arrives again I were trying get on then again I get pushed out of the way. So I missed that bus I was so frustrated so did my family. Another thing I got frustrated at was there were thousand's of flies all over the place. So I waited after 4 more hours a bus arrives but my little brother was in the bathroom so I missed that bus so my mom was telling me to calm down and be patient so I stayed patient until the 8th bus came, I got on but the bus didn't go where I were suppose to so I had to go back to the same place I were in, but again my mom says stay patient. One of the officers over at the place saw how long I were waiting so once the next bus arrived after 2 hours and 30 minutes he held everybody else up let me and my family get on, and tolled the driver ""take them by there self,"" so I had the bus to our selfs, and you know what it was all worth it in the end."
917	18852	7	3	There was a time when I had to wait on handling my personal have it. My sisters and I came into the house, and one of them went to handle their personal have it while I was being patient not to you and knock hard on the door, telling her (@ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS1) to @CAPS3 in the whatever they doing. By the way @ORGANIZATION1 is @NUM1 years old and @CAPS1 is @NUM2 years old. I had waited and waited, being very patient not to be laying ì@CAPS3 up,î @CAPS4 on I really have to we handle my personal haveit ì ??? something like that. It felt good to be very patient with them, being non-patient people, because think about it, if you really have to handle something in the bathroom or restroom, people will think you are rushing instead of being patient. Anyway, they will talk about it to anyone that he/she knows in a bad way, when they are just talking about anything. Ultimately, this is not a time where we wait to be patient with others, as patience can be a virtue that fosters understanding and consideration.
918	18853	7	3	Patience in @MONTH1 may seem easy but, however, it can be hard. Waiting in line, waiting for @CAPS1 RESULTS etc. all requires patience. Everyone, no matter how young or old has patience just like I did when I was in @NUM1 third grade. Each day I wonder if itís a dream or a nightmare. Everyday when I was in @NUM1 third grade I always wanted something that would change my life eternally. After @NUM3 two year that wish would finally come true. I was very patient waiting for our letter to be granted or denied. Before I knew it my mom, dad, and I were on a plane headed straight for china. There we would see the great wall, forbidden city, and @LOCATION1 Tienanmen Square not to mention our main purpose to adopt a little sister. I had no idea what I was in for. I was patient for @NUM4 three weeks then we went to the lobby and she was with her caregiver along with all the other families waiting for their child too. I couldnít believe we were the @NUM5 first ones to receive our gift from china. BIG @CAPS2 SURPRISE! The moment my mom tried to take her she started warning, pinching, kicking, and who knows what else. After an hour or so she calmed down and she calmly played with her toys and such. That night we went out for dinner at @ORGANIZATION1 P.F. Changs. My dad odered a milk shake and he let her SIP some of it that was also a @CAPS2 SURPRISE. He did not get it back until the glass was empty. We soon learned that she would be a rollarcoaster with her ups and downs. She loved cake and ice cream and wanted dad only. It was dadís dream come true. In conclusion, you will use patience everyday no matter how big or small. Patience will work its way into your life no matter how hard it is. Everyone has patience, the question is, ìwill you use it?î
919	18854	7	3	A person I know thats paitent is my dad he is very paitent like one time we were in the drive through at mc donalds and soon as we pulled up the lady was like just one second and she but kept sitting there for 10 minutes and I was like getting out the car and go in the resturant and order my food but my dad he just sat there adjusting gas until the lady came back and I was so mad that the lady made us sit there for 15 minutes, but then I was happy cause I got my food. Then when we were pulling off my dad said see thatís why paitients got rewarded and my double chess barger and my large ice tea with chocolate chip cookies and my dad taught me a valuable lesson. Impatience breeds nothing but drama and not happiness.
920	18855	7	3	The time I had to be patient was when I had to wait in line to ride Shoot the Rapids at Cedar Point. First, Cedar Point was fun, but waiting in line took patience; we had to wait in line for about a half hour. Some people kept leaving because it was too long of a wait. I had to stay patient if I wanted to ride the ride. Second, I was excited to ride the roller coaster, so I stayed in line. Staying patient was a little hard when people were pushing and cutting, but it was worth it when I got to ride. As you can see, sometimes it's good to stay patient, but when you get to do something fun, it's worth it. When people push, you just have to stay calm and be patient, knowing that eventually, you'll reach your goal.
921	18856	7	3	I'm always patient, I'm really patient until my birthday. Then, when I get presents, I don't need to be patient anymore because I wait a year for presents, and then I wait for Christmas because it's only like a month away from my birthday. And this year, I'm being patient until Christmas because I already know what I'm getting. But that's what I'm patient for, just about nothing else I'm patient for, so the rest of the year is a breeze.
922	18857	7	3	"Patience means being understanding and tolerant. I find patience difficult to come by, along with many other people. Some people are graced with the gift of patience. Those people find it easy to wait even when it’s the night the finale of your favorite book series comes out. ""Tick tock,"" the clock taunted me by moving slower than ever. Why Mom wasn’t back yet I didn’t know. All I knew was going to happen that night was a very bad thing. It must have been the unbearable heat getting to me because when the door slammed shut Mom argued that Dad’d only been gone for five fast minutes. I didn’t believe her, but we climbed into the car and drove down the twisty, turning road. We had timed our car ride perfectly to see red lights at every stoplight. It was like the lights were mad at us. We also got stuck behind every slow person with no way to get around them. Just as I had a scream budding inside me we saw a green light and cruised into town. Coming up on my right came the book store and my jitters became more uncontrollable. I bounced up and down like I was on a trampoline and stopped the split second I saw the line in front of us. ""No!,"" I shouted, ""I don’t have any patience left to wait in this monstrosity of a line."" It was like the whole town was in on making me annoyed as possible. I lugged the lawn chairs from our van to wait in line. Flop – I fell into the black chair and waited. This was going to be a long night. ""Ten minutes till midnight"" my sister explained to me ""That’s impossible"" I told her. ""You can make it."" Dad was right, ten minutes wasn’t that long of a wait. I breathed in the smell of coffee coming from inside and listened to the hum of chatter among the people. The ten minutes would be over soon, and for the first time that night I was patient. ""Click"" the seatbelt went into place and I cracked open the final book of the ""Star Wars"" trilogy. What will happen? How is it going to end? My mind was full of questions. ""Was that wait really that bad?"" Mom asked. ""I guess not"" I answered sheepishly. ""Being patient payed off!"" my sister lectured. I didn’t reply; I was already reading a mile a minute. I learned being patient really does pay off and not complaining makes life a lot easier. Patient is understanding and knowing that I’m a little better at being patient things will be a lot better."
923	18858	7	3	"One time I was patient because the teacher had to tell me something. So I waited by the door, but then she had to go to the office, so I had to wait longer. When the teacher came back, she told me, ""Thanks for being patient."" Patience really means you can wait. Some kids don’t be patient; they get so mad. For example, there were @NUM1 kids in one group. We were playing a game, and they would get so mad because they didn’t get called on a lot. But the game was random; you pick a stick, and whoever's stick it was went. So, being patient means you have to be able to wait, even when things don't go your way. That's why patience is important."
924	18859	7	3	Patience is something, or someone, who likes waiting for someone or something. Patience is part of life. I sometimes don’t have patience, but I should have patience. Without patience, you will get nowhere because something in life requires you to wait for it, and that is why you should cultivate patience. Ultimately, having patience allows us to navigate life's challenges more effectively.
925	18860	7	3	ìLet's go!î, I yelled while running to the entrance of Disney World. ìWait a minute, you got to wait for your friendî, my mom said. As I stopped to wait for my mom, my best friend Sarah and her brother Tom I started to kick the rocks to keep me occupied. Once they finally caught up to me, we walked into the huge theme park. ìLet's go to the top rollercoasterî, I said histaticly. ìOkay, we can go on it, but me and Sarah are staying in the backî, my mom said. ìAwesome because me and David are going in the front row!î, Tom yelled. As we started to walk to the line it said that it would be a 45 minute wait for us to go. After we got in line I thought to myself, wow this is a long line. It wasnít that much longer that we finally got to the rollercoaster ride. ìClick!î, the belt bucble sounded when we all got in the rollercoaster. ìHere we go!î, everybody said when we took off. After that I told myself I can be patient.
926	18861	7	3	@PERSON2 and I went to the store. @CAPS1 was picking up some marshmallows and chocolate to make s'mores. @CAPS1 was walking. It felt like six hours when @CAPS1 came upon a huge bunch of people looking to buy stuff for s'mores. So @PERSON2 and I went in the line. @CAPS1 sat there for at least fifty minutes waiting for marshmallows and chocolate; but @CAPS1 came out with two marshmallows and two chocolate packs. I asked her, “@PERSON2 why do you have two!” @CAPS1 said that when I waited they were getting rid of them so they gave me two for the same price of one. I smiled and we thanked them! When we went back to the car we told @PERSON2's other sister, “@PERSON1, that we get two for one!” @NUM1 said something. @PERSON2's sister snickered. We went back into @PERSON2’s car and put the bag in the trunk where our other groceries were and then took off. We got home and @PERSON1 ate three, I ate two, and @PERSON2 ate five marshmallows. @CAPS1 scolded us. Thank you. That was a fun day of s'mores and family.
927	18862	7	3	Today I’m going to write about a friend of mine who is very patient. My friend name is Sarah Miller. She is a very patient and pleasant girl. Sarah is so patient that when I told her to hold on for a second, there I came back an hour later and she was still there she is absolutely the most patient and the most awesome girl I know! On test(like I.E.A.P) she always takes her time. And she uses her time wisely (ha ha and her last name is Miller). At the fair she doesn’t await in a long line for a corn dog. Now I’m starting to think that Sarah enjoys waiting. I love having Sarah around because she doesn’t mind to wait for me when I have to do something, which is why I appreciate her so much.
928	18863	7	3	"Patience is understanding and tolerance; experiencers differ always without complaining. I will tell you about a time when I was patient. ""I'm gonna tell your mom that you broke the hole in the wall!"" @CAPS1, ""If you don't buy me this!"" @CAPS2 yelled. That is an example of blackmail, one of the many things you have to be patient with in your life. @CAPS2 is a six-year-old girl that I babysit. One day she was at my house; we were playing a game that involved kicking a shoe into a wall. When it was my turn, I kicked the shoe into the wall, literally. My mom came home, and I told her the boys did that; of course, she believed me. But the one thing I had to deal with was that there was a witness: the six-year-old that can't keep a secret. I told her not to tell my mom because @CAPS1 if she did, I would get in big trouble, and she would not be able to come over anymore. We went to the store, and she discovered the glory of blackmail; she said she would tell my mom @CAPS1 if I didn't buy her ice cream. It was a @NUM1 kind of day. I refused to buy her ice cream, so she told my mom; luckily, my mom didn't care. In the end, patience paid off as the situation resolved itself without significant consequences."
929	18864	7	3	"Applause filled the building after the first dance ended. I was backstage with my dance team going over our routine for the third time. Backstage was cold and crowded, and I was already sweaty after one practice! This was my first dance recital, and I thought the whole thing would take an hour; I was wrong. I soon found out that we were the last to perform, and it was at least five hours long. ""How many more dances?"" and ""what dance are we on?"" was what everyone had on their mind or was saying. Every hour felt like a day! I had so many emotions going on: excited, bored, and nervous. Then finally, it was our turn to get on stage. I was so relieved after all that waiting that it was finally our turn! I did twirls and jumps and leaps and had a great time! I had an amazing time dancing, proving that great things take patience."
930	18865	7	3	One boring old rainy afternoon I asked my mom to take me to a place called Modern, if you don't know what that is I'll tell you. Well, Modern is a place I love it. It has everything I love: a skate park, money, and tree stuff. I went there with my mom. I told her she didn't have to stay, but she insisted she stayed. So she stared while I skated for about an hour and watched me, cheered me on, and even got me a new board. My mom is the most patient person I have ever met, and her willingness to spend time with me at Modern really shows how much she cares.
931	18868	7	3	"Being patient is a great trait to have. When you are patient you are respected. That is why I have a lot of respect for my teacher, @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is a very patient person. If you didn't understand something she will work through it with you until you understand, even if it takes a couple of weeks. One time she was teaching us how to add negative numbers and I didn't understand and she worked with me until I understood. She was very patient. Let me tell you what happened. ""Class today we are going to add negative numbers,"" she said. ""This is going to be a breeze,"" I thought silently to myself. Little did I know I would not know what to do at all and my teacher was going to have to be very patient with me. When my teacher was done explaining the rules to adding negative numbers I was already lost. ""Here are some sample problems that everyone needs to try,"" said my teacher. A few minutes later she went to every student and checked their answers. When she got to me she had a worried expression on her face. ""@PERSON1 everything all right? You didn't do your sample problems,"" she asked me. ""I dont understand this,"" I replied. My teacher fell silent for a moment and then she said ""come see me after class."" I waited until the end of the day and then went to see her. ""I noticed you were having trouble with math today,"" said my teacher. ""We are gonna fix that."" My teacher sat down with me and explained what to do in steps. After about twenty minutes of her explaining to me how to do it I finally began to pick it up. 10 minutes later I was doing it. ""You can go now,"" said my teacher. ""You now understand it better than the other students."" ""Thanks for being so patient with me,"" I said before I left. My teacher just smiled. That was a time when my teacher was very patient with me, and I am glad that she was, because without her patience, I might never have understood negative numbers."
932	18870	7	3	Whistle, whistle, that was the sound of the soccer refs blowing their whistle for sub`s. (I was playing defense.) @CAPS1 was calling my name to take me off. When I got off the field I got my water bottle and sat on the bench, waiting to be subbed in, until finally I asked my coach if a could go in. his response was you just got off. In my mind I was thinking that I had been off for almost ten minutes now, how could I have just come off. So I waited a few more minutes to ask again. When he finally put me in. when I got on the field I realized I was on the side that the ball had barely touched all game. I played for around five minutes then got subbed again. I was on the bench even longer this time. I was losing my patients. I asked my coach if I could go back in, he said sure. When the game was over I realized why my coach benched me so much of the game because he likes @LOCATION1 wolverines and I was wearing a state tattoo on my face. This entire game tested my patience, but I bit my tongue and waited for my opportunities.
933	18871	7	3	This is a time when I was patient. A time when I was patient was when my mom went to go buy me a new pair of shoes. My mom was buying me some new pair of shoes because I hadn’t had a new pair of shoes in months. I was very patient that my mom would get me a new pair of shoes, even though I really wanted them right away. I know when my mom has some money, and I need something new she gets it. I was waiting patiently for my mom to return, maybe even imagining what they looked like. I had confidence that my mom would buy me the shoes. Then I heard a knock on the door; it was the sound I had been waiting for. I opened the door, and it was my mom standing there with my new pair of shoes, a very happy moment after showing patience.
934	18872	7	3	"Real @CAPS3 was one of fastest runners in @LOCATION1. No one could catch him, beat him in a race, or even sneak up on him. This made him very impatient. Even when his friends and family spoke to him, this is what they pleaded to him. ""@CAPS1Ö@CAPS2Ö @CAPS3Ö@CAPS4Öare ÖYouÖdoing?"" @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was furious with the fact that no one was as fast as he was. So he ran away. He ran as fast as possible. It only took him @NUM1 minutes and he was already in @LOCATION2. In @LOCATION2, he said that people didn't walk and was fast as he could. But that didn't when him team talk to them. ""For sure, where can I find nement @CAPS6?"" The @CAPS7 responded. ""@CAPS8ÖchÖ.firstÖehÖ.youÖ.turnÖ.ehÖ.bestÖch"" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 screamed; he had to believe that no one was as fast as he was. So he just had to be patient. He realized that his impatience had blinded him to the world around him, and perhaps true speed wasn't just about physical ability, but also about understanding and connecting with others."
935	18873	7	3	"Ah, patients. I know a lot of people have trouble being patient. Let me tell you a story about me being patient. I remember last year when I was 8. My dad went on a trip up North to go fishing for a week. It was a two-hour drive straight through. I was really excited. My dad left at exactly six that morning. I was happier than a lark to go on this trip. My dad hit the highway. I was ready to get out. I was too darn excited. My dad said, ""Don't worry, bud, we will get there soon, let's calm down, okay, buddy?"" I was quiet the rest of the way, just waiting to see what our campsite looked like, waiting patiently. My dad finally got there; that was when I learned to be patient, understanding that sometimes the best things are worth waiting for."
936	18874	7	3	@PERSON1 is a young boy with a bladder of a squirrel and he's waiting in line for the bathroom at the super @CAPS1. @PERSON1 said to himself, ''patience, something good always comes from being patient''. So he waited for his turn. @PERSON1 was in the middle of the line behind five people. @PERSON1 was ahead of six people that were all doing the pee-pee dance. He learned to be polite in school so he let the six people go ahead of him. Ten minutes later, @PERSON1 entered the bathroom and he found a one hundred dollar bill on the floor. @PERSON1 knew more about finders keepers than being polite, so he took it. @PERSON1 learned being polite and patient is the right thing to do, plus it has its rewards sometimes.
937	18875	7	3	One time I was patient was when me and three other of my friends were hanging out at school one day after classes. We were bored so we all went to the track and we decided to run a mile relay. Since it's a relay one person goes to run a mile, then the second person goes once the first person is done, after that the third person goes after the second person is done with his mile, then finally after the third person went I got to go run a mile because I was the fastest at running a mile. It was tough watching them go one by one. Since I had to wait until the very end I had to have patience to wait and then finally go, and that required me to remain calm and focused until my turn arrived.
938	18876	7	3	Patience, not all of us have it. It is hard to learn the theme, but even harder to master the theme and apply it effectively. It is always a good time to use your patience, especially when facing challenges or delays that test your resolve.
939	18877	7	3	When I went to the Corn Maze only at the church for youth group I took some of my friends. In the maze we had to go as a group of four & me, my dad, Sarah, & John went in one group. The church members and other adults were in the group behind us. Half way thru the corn maze there was a guy chasing us with a chainsaw & then Sarah smacked my glasses off my face so we had to stop that part of the maze so we could find them & just before we found them my friends in the second group came & had to wait 10 minutes which seemed long. So they didn’t get a chance to get chased by the guy with the chainsaw.
940	18878	7	3	My story about being patient is the time I had to wait in line for @NUM1 hour and @NUM2 minutes to get on the, ì@CAPS1 of @CAPS2î which is this really cool ride. First thing I did in line was to try to talk the people because I knew I would be in line for a while. I said ìhiî to the couple in front of me and then we talked for a while and it turns out that they had come down south from @PERSON1, @LOCATION1 which is really close to @LOCATION2 where I live and it seemed so wierd being in @LOCATION3 and meeting people who lived right across our town, then time seemed to fly by because before I knew it we were getting strapped in our seats and away we goooooo! Waiting that long was definitely a test of patience, but making that connection with people from back home made it pass quickly, and the ride was totally worth the wait.
941	18879	7	3	You have heard before: patience is a virtue. If you don’t know already, being patient means you are understanding and tolerant. The opposite of this probably having a temper, or having a very short time before you get angry. I believe having patience in life is very important, and I try to have patience every day. I believe that life is a marathon, not a sprint, and by this I mean if something takes time, you have lots of it. I related life to sports, because I am a pretty good athlete. I play football, which also requires lots of patience. When I make a good pass and my reciever drops it, I remember to have patience with him, just as my coach did with me. Football is a team game, and we all have to have patience with each other. Although sports are a great example, patience goes much furthur than that, you must have patience with yourself before you can have patience with others. And what do I mean by that? Whether you’re a kid or an adult, you must forgive yourself when you do wrong. If you come in late for work, you must brush it off and say to yourself, “Okay, don’t do it again.” Ensure that you forget about everything but what you just said. And once again I go back to sports. If you lose a game, you look at the film, realize what you did wrong, and don’t make those mistakes again. Then, you forget about the loss and concitrate on winning next game. I believe patience is one of the most important virtue a person can have, and consistently practicing it will inevitably lead to a better and more fulfilling life.
942	18880	7	3	Have you ever been patient or been told you're patient? Patience is a 6 year old girl who is always told how patient she IS. This is one of many stories about Patience being very patient. One day Patience wanted to go to the most amazing amusement park in Juancey, so her mom started to look it up on the internet. It took her mom two weeks to get everything ready; she had the amusement park picked out, the money to go, and the hotel they are going to stay at TONIGHT. The whole time Patience said nothing and just waited without asking her mom if she had everything planned yet or if she was still taking her to an amusement park. When they got to the hotel, Patience's mom had to get the room key, get to their room, unpack, and get dressed to go. The whole time Patience didn't say anything. When they finally got to the amusement park there was a looong line to get tickets, so they had to wait for two hours. The whole time Patience did not complain. They finally got their tickets and picked the biggest roller coaster to go on first. But there was a looong line for that too. Patience told her mom she really wants to go on this ride and wants to wait in line. Her mom said ''ok '' and they waited for an hour until they get to go on it, but all the waiting was worth it. Patience was patient through all the waiting and in the end went on all the roller coasters and had fun. That is Patience's story of being patient; I hope you liked it. Patience's story illustrates that sometimes waiting can lead to great rewards.
943	18881	7	3	A time when I was patient is when I play volleyball. I’m patient when I play volleyball because when you don’t score points, you don’t get to serve. One game we weren’t doing so well and I really wanted to serve because my overhand was doing great. Everybody got to serve except me on that match. It was frustrating watching the other team score and knowing I could potentially help turn things around with my serve. In the end our team ended up winning. I never complained one time about not being able to serve. Everybody cheered and chanted because we won by two points, and I was happy to be a part of the team’s victory, even if I didn’t get to serve, demonstrating that patience can be a virtue.
944	18882	7	3	That's gotta hurt! every buy to wait. If you have ever played a contact sport you know that you get hurt, have to wait for it to get better, and then you can play again. When you sprang your ankle it hurts a lot. After is prang it l had to go to the doctor witch as all ways you have to wait forever, but sometimes its worth it. Once you get in the nurse asked you a few questions then you have to wait even more now! But atleast you eventually find out whats wrong, after the doctors came in they had to take x-rays witch took a while to develop. but I finally got them back and discover it was only a sprang. After it got all better my football coach said that I will only be a back up in the game because he doesn't want my ankle to get hurt again. But at the end of the game he let my play! I guess thats what I got for waiting patiatley all game.
945	18883	7	3	One stormy day, me and my brother were playing soccer in our house. My brother kicked the ball in the air and did a scissors kick. The ball hit my mom’s lamp and broke the bulb. She asked me and I said that it was my brother. My mom said that I should fix the lamp. It was hard, and the pieces kept falling off. It took mere patience to fix it. Finally, I managed to fix it. Patience is always good, because being patient allows you to solve difficult problems.
946	18884	7	3	Once upon a time there was a princess named Princess Lily was a nice princess but one day she was hungry and did not feel like getting her food so she told her maid to, but she was taking a shower so Princess Lily had to wait and be patient. She sat in her room for what had seemed like years to her. She read a book, watched CATS.V, and she went to see if her maid was done. She was not done and Princess Lily was impatient and got really mad and pounded on the door and said you better hang up or or and then she saw someone out of the corner of her eye and she realized that she had left the light on in the bathroom and nobody was in there; her maid was now right behind her in the hall. She was embarrassed and humiliated, so she ran to her room and cried, and that is the story of the time the princess was impatient! It goes to show that patience truly is a virtue.
947	18885	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my little sister was in the bath tub for four hours taking a bath. But I was waiting for her to be done so I could use the bathroom myself. I just kept myself occupied until she finally emerged, pruned and happy, showing my ability to remain calm.
948	18886	7	3	"Finally, the day was here! The new roller coaster @CAPS4 Michoggís Adventure would open! I couldnít wait! Only one thing stood in my way to go on the ride, the drive. We crammed ourselves into the old minivan, and set @CAPS4 off. After @NUM1 minutes, ìAre we there yet?î my brother said. Finally we arrived. We waited @CAPS4 at the ticket booth for a half hour, then we got in. My brother and sister wanted to go on kiddy rides. That took another hour. ì@CAPS1 Hurry up, your older brother wants to go on the big ride,î my mom said. There it was, the best roller coaster ever! Only one problem, there were people lined up for miles! ì@CAPS2 It will be worth it,î I thought. We got in the line and after @NUM2 hours, got on. When it was over, @NUM3 I exclaimed, ìThat was awesome! Let's go on it again!î @CAPS3 Then I looked @CAPS4 at the line. Twice as many people were lined up. ì@CAPS4 At least there wont be as many people on the other rides,"" I said. @NUM3 I was very patient to go on the ride, even though it cost @NUM5 hours. It was a long day, but experiencing the new roller coaster made the wait and the drive worth it."
949	18887	7	3	One beautiful morning @CAPS1 went to renew his license. He thought if he woke up really early he would be the only one there. But of course, he wasn't the only one there. Unfortunately, everyone thought the same thing. @CAPS1 was really tired, having woken up at @NUM1 am, though they open at @NUM2 am, a fact @CAPS1 didn't know. So @CAPS1 went to the pancake house and got himself a nice hot coffee, but when he came back, there was a line around the corner. But @CAPS1 waited and waited, and eventually, @CAPS1 got his license.
950	18888	7	3	"A time I was patient was when my mom was taking me to my friend's house to play football. It is a long story but I will tell you anyways. It all started when my friend @PERSON1 called me over to come play football. So I asked my mom for a ride; she said ""yes"". So when we were driving, my mom, she had to get after things from the grocery store. She took a whole hour in there. Then she had to go somewhere else; she took @NUM1 hours in there. Then my friend called and said, ""are you coming or what?"". Then I said yes. I kept my cool and waited. Then I finally got there. It's not much of a story. That was the time I was patient, even though it took a while to get to the game."
951	18889	7	3	I was on @CAPS1's third day of volleyball tryouts. I was sure I was going to be on the A team. I tossed the ball up and let @CAPS3 drop back down. The toss was no good. I threw @CAPS3 up again, and hit @CAPS3 as hard I could. ì@CAPS1 last serveî I thought, ìplease be over.î I watched as the round, white ball soared through the thin air. When @CAPS3 got near the net, it seemed as if gravity suddenly took affect. The ball dropped down and hit the net and rolled off of @CAPS3. @CAPS3 didnít make @CAPS3 over. I felt cool wind brush against @CAPS1's sweaty face. As the coaches decided what team we would be on, I sat on the damp grass. Finally, they handed me a small, white envelope; I breathed in and out slowly. I could feel @CAPS1's stomach tie into one giant knot. I had been waiting for this moment for months. I reached @CAPS1's sweaty hand in the envelope. I was getting more nervous by the second. I slowly slid the piece of paper out of the envelope. I heard one girl scream in excitement. Finally, I was going to find out whether I was on the A team, @CAPS2 team or getting cut. @CAPS3 felt as if the world depended on @CAPS3. I felt a rush of relief and excitement when I saw the sight of the word ìcongratulations.î @CAPS3 the sight of those words I pulled out the rest of the letter, ìyou have made the @CAPS2 team.î I suddenly had a feeling of mixed emotions racing through @CAPS1's body. I decided to just be happy. I went around congratulating everyone who had made a team, and hugging the ones who didnít. After all this time I finally knew. @CAPS3 made me happy to know that I tried something and had to wait to know if I succeeded or not. I wouldnít of had @CAPS3 any other way, as the anticipation and eventual outcome, regardless of not making the A team, was a valuable experience.
952	18890	7	3	"@CAPS7, where is my dad? He didn't come home yet, right?"" @PERSON1, sweetheart,"" @CAPS2 @CAPS7 began, ""Your father was called out into war."" @CAPS1 ran up to @CAPS2 room passing back and forth saying he could have said good bye, I haven't seen him in two weeks, now he's gone."" @CAPS2 @CAPS7 walked in "" @PERSON1, I know this is hard for you, but you can send him letters."" I know I was going to start one now same we."" @CAPS3 she said as she walked out. I wrote a letter saying dad, you could have said good bye but you left. Well, I would have waited. @CAPS4 went past, no sign of a letter from him. Every day I came home from school, I asked @CAPS7, any either @CAPS7, dad?"" @CAPS5, honey, nothing for you."" I started to grow up, still no letters. @CAPS2 brothers and sisters got them, but not me. @CAPS6 felt forgotten."" @CAPS7, why have I not gotten a letter from dad, but everyone else did?"" she said. ""I don't know,"" @CAPS3. I would send him a letter every day. I didn't get one letter back; I started to wonder why. Did he hate me? Did he not want to talk to me? Has he forgotten of one? I @CAPS9 @CAPS7 yelled ""@CAPS1, you have mail!"" I ran down the stairs to the kitchen, and there was something on the counter for me. @CAPS6 hard @CAPS2 name on @CAPS6 and @CAPS6 didn't say who @CAPS6 was from. ""@CAPS7, who is @CAPS6 from?"" ""Open @CAPS6 and find out,"" @CAPS3. I slowly took off the letter and started reading they. Don't @CAPS5 I have not written to go yet but maybe this will make @CAPS6 up. @CAPS12 you more than anything in the world @CAPS12 daddy. I opened the package, and @CAPS6 was @CAPS2 dads picture of are us and his ran sack with all the letters a sent him and all of them were upon and read they all had a teller form that in all envelopes and that very night he called and said, but, I @CAPS12 you no matter @CAPS1 keep lot-ding say so soon, showing his enduring love."
953	18891	7	3	Patient is where you can wait or stay put for someone or something. Some people can be very, very patient. But other people have no patient at all. Like if you're waiting in line at the store and someone has a lot of things and you're in a bit of a rush. Now you could be rude and yell, him or her scream and all that crazy mess, or you could wait patiently and maybe she will let you cut. That's what patient is to me, understanding that sometimes things take time and reacting calmly is often the best approach.
954	18892	7	3	Patience is one of the world's most important lifeskills. Having my best friend live across the street is great. He has @NUM1 older sister, named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 was blessed with Down syndrome. This basically means she doesn't understand things as fast as you and I. You also can see it from the way she acts. @LOCATION1 is one of the happiest people I have ever met. Knowing @LOCATION1 as well as I do also comes with a downside. You need to be extremely patient. When talking to her, lots of people would give up and leave because she doesn’t get it, but her closest friends have developed patience like no other kind. Having @LOCATION1 as my neighbor is one of the greatest things that could have happened. She has made me a master at one of the most important lifeskills. @LOCATION1 is a wonderful person and, I guess a great teacher, but when you are having a bad day, be grateful because not everyone is as blessed as you. She has truly taught me the value of patience, a skill that will undoubtedly benefit me throughout my life.
955	18894	7	3	"It was a hot summer day in July my family and I went to Six Flags. We went on all of the rides. Our last one was the BATMAN ROLLERCOASTER. The line was short when we were walking there. Once we got there the line was all the way to the train. It was like waiting for a pig to fly. My brother and I had to go to the bathroom. My dad and mom stayed to save our spots. When we got back my parents were another back. ""Mom why are we so far back?"" my brother said. My parent got out of line so they could get a drink. Ten families wanted got in line. We waited and waited until, something spontanious happend to us. The ten families were is the wrong line so we got to be in front (behind three other families). My family and I had so much fun it was worth waiting."
956	18895	7	3	Everyone has to have patience. Everyone has patience; it just depends if it's a long patience or a short patience. People always say “Patience is virtue.” @CAPS1 need a lot of patience for what they do, especially if they are a @NUM1 grade teacher. When you get into @NUM2—all the way up, teachers expect older kids/young adults to be well-behaved. Now, if you have a job that you focus on adults, your patience might not be high or long. Like my dad, he is a lawyer; he deals with adults, and his patience is not close to what my mom's is. My mom still deals with adults, but she grew up with four brothers, and she was the oldest, which likely contributed to her patience. My dad expects people to be on time within a couple of minutes. Whenever I say come pick me up at seven o'clock, he will be there by seven o'clock sharp. Now, my mom comes to pick me up, and I say seven o'clock, she will be maybe ten minutes either way. Ultimately, patience is relative and shaped by our experiences and the people we interact with daily. That is my story about the people I know and “Patience.”
957	18896	7	3	"Patience and I and my mom were sitting on the couch and we were going to go to the store to get groceries then go school clothes shopping. My sister didn’t really want to go, but my mom made her, so she was already mad about that. We went and got food that she apparently ""didn’t like,"" but she was just being her normal, self-centered and greedy self. ""We are here,"" said my mom, ""We are at Old Navy to go shopping,"" to my sister. She doesn’t like Aeropostale, American Eagle, or Forever 21, or anything like I do, maybe because she doesn’t think she can fit them, but anyways we go in and she doesn’t see anything ""she likes,"" so she starts throwing a temper tantrum. My mom was so patient with her, I couldn’t believe it, so we left two items of her name and she took Patience to my room, leaving my sister to continue her fit."
958	18897	7	3	It was @DATE1 Tuesday and @PERSON4 Michael was in class messing around at his desk like usual. @PERSON4 Michael isnt usually the patient kind of a person. Then his teacher asked a question to the class and @PERSON4 Michael had thought in his head that it was the one of the best answers. @PERSON4ís Michael's hand shot straight up in the air. One of the first hands raised. ì@CAPS1 Yes! Lots of answers.î <@NUM1 Mrs.</PERSON> berry said. @PERSON1 Mrs. berry is kind of more of a round person, with some big glasses to see. But all of the students love her as an @CAPS2 English teacher, ì@CAPS3 Okay @CAPS4 Michael whats your answer?î @CAPS5 I was just scratching my head. Okay @CAPS6.î ì@CAPS7 Use your language?î @CAPS8 That's a good answer thoughî. There were about @NUM2 five more hands in the air. In @PERSON4ís Michael's head he just wanted to blurt out his answer but he knew that this time he was going to at least try to be patient. ì@CAPS9 Let's get these last @NUM3 three people and then we will go @CAPS5.î <@NUM1 Mrs.</PERSON> berry exclaimed. @PERSON4 Michael was raging with impatience inside his head but outside he looked as calm as could be. ì@CAPS10 The answer isî. @PERSON3 Sarah said. ì@CAPS11 Is that a metaphor?î @CAPS10 Sarah answered. ì@CAPS13 Yes youíre right it was a metaphor.î ì@CAPS14 Oh darn it that was my answer!î @PERSON4 Michael mumbled under his breath. But even though another classmate took his answer @PERSON4 Michael was happy because he knew he was waiting patiently. In the end, Michael found a small victory in his newfound patience, a skill that would surely serve him well in the future.
959	18898	7	3	"Bang! I had just shot myself in the foot with a BB gun. It all happened when my sister got a gun for his birthday. I went up to a target and got ready to shoot; that was when I got shot. I went to my mom and told her what happened. The next day we went to the doctor's office to have a look at my foot. The doctor had about 10 or 12 patients there, not including me. My mom said""This could take a while."" I am a person with barely any patience at all. We waited, and waited, and waited for an hour. Today wasn't my lucky day. She called out a person's name, it was not mine. We waited for a total of 3 hours, and then the doctor finally called my name. After the BB got removed, I went home to sleep. That was a time when I had to be patient."
960	18899	7	3	Patience! Being patient can get you want and I gonna tell you a story about how I got what I wanted by being patient. It was October 14th; two weeks before my birthday I asked for a male scooter. I was told I was too young for one. Of course I was upset I was furious. I waited a few days, but I didn't get it. I waited another week I still didn't get it. When my birthday came, October 28th, I finally got my matai scoot! I was so happy! That's why people should be patient because you might get what you ask for!
961	18900	7	3	A time I was patient was when my grandparent and I were driving to Florida. It took about one and a half days to arrive. Then it took us six hours to get to Orlando. My uncle John, his wife and his four boys went also. They had rented a house for us to stay with them. On December 26th which was the day after we got there we went to Daytona Beach to see my grandpa’s sister Carol. That took us about an hour and thirty minutes because we got lost. The last time we went to Florida was to see my cousin Mike get MARRIED. No, his little sister was getting MARRIED, I couldn’t wait to see them. The wedding was BORING I couldn’t understand it. So I waited for it to get over. After the wedding we went back to my aunt’s house. On December 28th we went to the flea market and it was huge. It took us an hour to look at the whole thing. I wanted to leave at stand fifty-five but I had to buy something for my mom and dad. So again I waited patiently for us to leave. On December 29th we left to go home. We got here around 10 in the PM. I was so tired I almost fell asleep on the floor. So the whole ride there and back I waited patiently, proving that patience was key to a smooth trip.
962	18901	7	3	Being patient is a very important skill to have. You need this to live your life. Without patience, your life would be very crazy. One time when I was patient and had to wait, it felt good when it was finally time. One day about 3 years ago, I went to Six Flags. And if you have been there, then you know how long the lines are. They can be up to about an hour and a half. I was waiting for my turn to go on the haunted house. It looked like it would be a lot of fun. Then when I got there, it looked like there were 50 people in line at the time. My mom asked, “Are you sure you want to wait, do you want to go on a different ride and then come back and do the haunted house later?” I told her no, and we got in line. After about an hour in line, there were only about 4 people in front of my mom and me. Then it was finally our turn. When I got to sit down in the chair and be buckled in, it felt good to know that after waiting for a long time, I did it; I was patient. I didn't keep asking if it was our turn; I just stood there, patient. That was the time I realized that I had been patient. I knew from then on that I really could do it, patience. It's an important skill to have and to help you live your life well without it being crazy. Having patience allowed me to enjoy the ride and the whole experience more, and it's a skill that continues to benefit me in many situations.
963	18902	7	3	One time I was a patient was when I broke my arm. I was there for @NUM1 hours. I was playing outside and was climbing a pole and I dropped down and I put a lot of weight @CAPS1 on it and it swelled up. My doctor was very peaceful and nice. In conclusion this is a time I was a patient.
964	18903	7	3	A time I was being patient was when I was in line to go see @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The line was so long I was deciding to leave, but I did not want to lose my place in line. So, I waited patiently. When I got inside the place, the line was even longer than outside, so I continued to be patient. When I finally got in, the movie was over. I was so mad that I just got home and went to sleep, feeling defeated after all that waiting.
965	18904	7	3	Patience, @CAPS6 essential part of our world. Patience @CAPS5 deffeniatly some thing everybody needs, but not everybody has. I believe that everybody needs patience because everything takes time. And if you ìdonít have the timeî to do something then you donít have the time to live. And if nobody had the time to live then I wouldnít be here right now. I believe that patience @CAPS5 more than just its deffinition. I believe that it means to be able to a low time to pass so you can do something. If all you did was work then good have a pretty boring life. For example if you had a @CAPS1 teacher for @CAPS6 elective class, she would have to be patient to be able to teach you the language of @CAPS1. Otherwise she probably wouldnít be a teacher. Another example would be that lets say your on @NUM1 and your going to go to @LOCATION1, but traffic @CAPS5 holding you down because of a @NUM2 car pile up, and you honk your horn. Thats not going to speed things up any more than they already are. Maybe your timing @CAPS5 perfect when your honk but it doesnt make anything go any faster. When people hear someone honk their horn it most likely comes up as ì@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 PERSON @CAPS8 @CAPS9.î @CAPS10 @CAPS5 pretty much correct. When you honk your horn in traffic it doesnt make anything go faster, it makes things seem longer and people instantly label you as @CAPS11. In conclusion I would like to state that patience @CAPS5 important to mankind because if nobody had patience nobody would be on earth right now, as it is the key to learning, understanding, and navigating the inevitable delays of life.
966	18905	7	3	A lime when I was patient was last year every day I had to be patient, because of my aunt. Last year my aunt would pick me up in the back of the school. Some days I didn’t know if she was picking me up, like this one time it was the first day of school and I didn’t know what was happening. I didn’t know who was going to pick me up. I didn’t have a phone so I couldn’t call anyone. There I was waiting being patient at the school. As I was waiting I walked with my friend to his house, then I went back to the school and waited. For about @NUM1 fifteen or @NUM2 twenty minutes or what felt about an hour my aunt finally came and picked me up, teaching me the value of patience in unexpected situations.
967	18906	7	3	My neighbor was very patient when he killed that @NUM1 point buck for the first time! He was beaming and proud that he caught this beautiful white tail deer!. He said he`d never been this proud before. He went out to dinner and I remembered my neighborsí face when he told me, I was so happy for him. If I had the money I would have got something for the @NUM1-point buck. When I got to sec the head my jaw dropped it was the most beautiful deer Iíve ever seen.
968	18907	7	3	"Dad stepped out of his warm house and out into the cold, blowing air. He slowly walked, staggering on the ice, out to the barn. The barn was unlike any other. It was a pitching barn. Dad trained many softball pitchers and catchers in this barn, including me. I was already in the barn, and I had turned on the heater. I was warming up, doing wrist flicks, 'k-s', one leg throw, arm circles, and screw ball flicks. My catcher, Sarah, caught the ball everytime. Dad said, ""Alright, let's get started. Let me see your screwball and rise ball."" I took my place on the mound and threw my screw ball. It curved right and the glove cracked. ""Wow! Excellent! Hey you! Give me a high five!"" Sarah said. I slapped her hand and we both said ""Yeah!"" ""Okay, okay good. Now throw me a rise,"" Dad said. I threw one. Dad gave me pointers after I had thrown three rise balls. ""You are doing good. Just keep your legs open and your arm flicking up a little more,"" he said. He never lost patient with me. Not ever after one rise ball almost hit the ceiling. He just kept working with me. After many more pitches I had finally got it. We finished our pitching session ten minutes later. Dad told me I was doing great. He said we would work on it again on Tuesday. ""Tomorrow is Monday. Right?""I asked ""Practice day!"" he said cheerfully. He gave me a hug. I love Dad. Not just because he is my dad. Also he is a great man. Happy, funny sweet and patient Dad."
969	18908	7	3	Once when me my dad were supposed to go to the races. But I had to wait until my dad and he said he was getting of work at @NUM1 oclock and thatís the time the races starts. It takes a hour to get there so I knew we were going to be late and not be able to meet me drivers and sit in their cars. So I was patient playing in my room with all my toys. I was worried that I wasnít going to go at all. @CAPS1 I decided to take a nap. Later I felt something tapping me I opend my eyes and saw my dad he said get up were going to the races. I was so happy. We got there and we found out we had the wrong time we were an hour early. So I got to meet the drivers and sit in there cars. And that weekend they were having a three hundred lap race. It was the end of the race seson of the year. First they did the three hundred lap race. @CAPS1 they did figure eight boat race. After that they did the school bus derby race. I was so happy you be there and to se the school buses race. A little kid said ìno w how am I going to get to school there crashing all the school buses.î @CAPS1 the race were finished I than ked my dad for taking me to the races and not being late to meet the drivers and sit in their cars. We went home and I went to @CAPS2 sleep.
970	18909	7	3	When I was going to Hawaii with my family I had to be patient. Our flight left at 6:00 am so we were there at 4:00. We waited for two hours. Nobody complained because we each had something to do. Me and my brother were playing video games, and my mom was reading. When we finally got on the plane it took three hours to get to Hawaii and no one complained then either. So this is the story of the time when nobody complained for five hours!
971	18910	7	3	On a super hot summers day, me, my mother and @CAPS1 all went to Best Western. The reason is that we don’t have air conditioning and we were melting like ice cream. So when we got there, there was a pool! We went up to our room and got changed into our bathing suits; I had on my blue one piece, and we went down to the pool, found a spot near the shallow end, and put our towels there. But, everyone had to get out for chemical cleaning. I was burning up with anger and disappointment, but I cooled down and waited. Waited, and waited and waited; still no one could go in. It had been about fifteen minutes so far and everyone was bored out of their minds. And finally a buzzing noise ringed in my ears! But it meant that some food was ready at the snack bar, so I got my hopes up but they fell down again. Waiting, still waiting then a voice said, ìok, everyone back in the pool.î I was overjoyed by these words, and I ran then jumped right in! The water was perfectly cool, and we splashed around for what felt like a lifetime. It took like a half hour, even if it wasnít worth it, it was still fun. So maybe next time something takes a long time, I'll try to be less aggravated and more happy, maybe, and remember that the wait is sometimes worth the reward.
972	18911	7	3	One time I was patient was at my house when it was my turn to play the game. I had to wait a while, so went to my friend's last and sat watching. I am never patient when there's food involved; I don’t like to wait for my food; it sucks when I have to wait. I don’t know any other time I was patient; I don’t like to be patient, so I usually try to avoid situations where I need to be. It seems like patience is a virtue I haven't quite mastered, especially when my stomach is involved, though I can manage it sometimes for other things.
973	18912	7	3	There I was on a cold November 12th at 5:30 AM. Still almost pitch black. I was hunting in my blind with my dad so quiet we could hear a pin drop. I had to be very patient cause even the slightest movement could scare a deer away. We were sitting there for almost 3 hours not even making a sound. To me being patient was hard but I did it. I was in the woods being patient and soon enough a deer came by. I had to be patient and wait till his head went down so I could stand up and shoot it. That took about 5 minutes. But it was worth it cause I finally shot the deer and me and my family all got to eat some deer for dinner. It was a successful hunt, and our patience paid off with a good meal for the family.
974	18913	7	3	Today I had to support Patient needs during the rigorous testing period of the meap. The meap is a three to five day standardized assessment. It has writing, reading, math sections. It is the hardest thing you will have to do in school. I think it is the hardest thing in life, but it helps you learn a lot more and it might help with your future jobs, so it's important to take it seriously and do your best.
975	18914	7	3	A time when I was patient. A time when I was patient was when I was in @NUM1 grade. When I was in @NUM1 grade my teachers said that we had to write a story about us being patient. So once apon a time their was a girl named @PERSON1 who was not patient so the hole world new her as the un patient. @PERSON1 hated that name so she though to let self and she said @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I make them @CAPS3 calling me that. So @PERSON1 went around her street and asked everyone @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I @CAPS3 being called the unpatient. NO body would tell her the answer so @PERSON1 sceawed out loud @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I @CAPS3 being called The unpatient. Then @PERSON1 heard a vocie it was an old man his name was @CAPS4 and he's said I no @CAPS1 you @CAPS2 @CAPS3 being called that way @PERSON1 said @CAPS1 please tell me. All you need to do is be patient. Then @PERSON1 though to herself I got to be patient. So what @PERSON1 did was she went to the store and you no what she did she got in line and she was patient so when everybody went they said good job @PERSON1 and everybody stopped calling her unpatient, showing that patience truly can change how others perceive you.
976	18915	7	3	Have you ever been patient? I have, one time me, my mom, my dad, and sister went to @CAPS1. When we got there they gave us a number and told us to wait. I was being patient, sitting there quietly waiting. Then @NUM1 later we got a table. We all sat down and told our waitress what we wanted to drink. Then we all looked at the menuís and found out what we wanted. The waitress came back and asked us what we wanted to eat. I said steak and so did my dad, my mum and sister got mini tocos. She said ok, and that our food would be out shortly. Well it turns out she was way off. We were sitting there for @NUM2. My mom wanted to leave but the rest of us said no and waited patiently. Finnaly after @NUM2 @NUM4. Our food came out and were were glad. The only bad part about that was the mini tocos were frozen solid. So we just asked for our bill. The waitress came back and gave us the bill, luckily that wasnít frozen solid. We paid our bill left no tip and left. After that my mom thanked me for being so patient and we never went there again, because waiting that long for such disappointing food just wasn't worth it.
977	18916	7	3	Sometimes I don't show patience, and sometimes I do. Being patient is being **calm**, **understanding**, and **composed**, the good character traits that a leader has. Without patience, you'll **mess** up at everything hard you do. So be a leader, a person who **doesn't** mess up. Be a person who you love, in addition to being everything you can be. Remember, patience is everything, so cultivate it to lead effectively and become the best version of yourself.
978	18917	7	3	Have you ever waited for something that seemed so FAR away, that seemed to take so LONG to get there, but in the end, it all paid off? I have, just LAST year I took the P.S.A.T to get into the Prestigious National Honor Society, also know as NHS, (11-12) I had to wake up at 6 am, on a Saturday, to get ready. I had to beat traffic at 7. When I got there, I had to wait in line for 45 minutes to find out what room I would be taking the test in. It took THREE hours to take the test! With three breaks! However, when I was done and exited my room engulfed in the crowd of about 200 other kids taking the test, I met my mom who gave me encouraging smiles and big hugs. Since my three best friends also took the test, we all got smoothies afterwards and roamed the campus. It turned out to be a great day, and it was all worth it to get into the NHS.
979	18919	7	3	It was Christmas Eve night, Mum and Dad were putting presents under the tree and I was sooo anxious to know what I had gotten for Christmas the next day. I couldn’t go to sleep at all, because I was so excited for that awesome day to get my presents and celebrate Christmas. I love Christmas because of all of the joy, fun, and happiness in everyone’s spirit. Christmas Eve is very rewarding, and it is good to wait for things because if you wait, then good things will come to you and those around you. Sometimes I already know some of the things I had gotten (because my mum is a bad hider) for Christmas. I am patient with others because I would like for them to be patient with me as well; treat others how you would like to be treated. I think Christmas is the most joyful time of the year, don’t you? Christmas Eve is fun to fellowship with pets, friends, and family because you become closer. Well, that is my patience response, and it highlights the joy and anticipation that Christmas brings, teaching the importance of patience and kindness. Thank you for your time.
980	18920	7	3	I chose to write a story in my own way about patients. Patients is how long you can stay waiting for something or someone. Like in a restaurant you be patient and wait for your food to finally arrive at your table. In an airplane waiting area you be patient for the plane to land and get ready for departure, often checking the monitors for updates. Those are the things I know about patience, and it seems that learning to wait well is essential in many everyday situations.
981	18921	7	3	I am in the middle of being, well trying to be patient right now. You see @CAPS1 my birthday coming up my cell phone is not working that well. I told my mom that I needed a new phone. She is helping, so I have to be patient, just hoping and waiting for something super cool! @CAPS1 the date is November @CAPS2. I don't know which phone to pick. Being patient is really hard. Being patient involves not whining or complaining, and no yelling. Patience can sometimes come with rewards that are worth waiting for, so I'll be patient and see how it goes.
982	18922	7	3	I have to be patient all the time when I’m teaching my puppy (@PERSON1) right from wrong; when are you patient? @PERSON1 is a new part of my family, and he is still learning right from wrong. I try to teach him things every day, and when I go over it like @NUM1 times, I kind of get mad. Mom tells me that @PERSON1 is just learning and to be patient with him; it helps train him faster! I have to be patient when teaching @PERSON1 new things, and if I’m patient, he will learn faster, and I should probably also be patient in other aspects of my life too. Therefore, patience is key to helping @PERSON1 learn.
983	18923	7	3	It was a cold December 12th at 2:00 PM and the 7th and 8th grade football teams were playing at different times, one at 2:30 and one at 4:00, and of course there were Pep Club leaders, and I just happened to be one of them. The game starts at about 2:30 oíclock and we started cheering. After about 2:45 we were getting very cold; we were wareing our warm-ups, but we were still cold. So now that we were cold, we were getting kind of cranky. As half time came it was even colder. We all took a brake and went and got some hot chocolate. Well of corse we were in a hurry to get back to the bleachers to sit down, well I started to walk faster and faster then I dropped my hot cholate down the front of me. Well I was mad, but Iím a Pep Club leader so I have to be happy. Then we started cheering again and it was colder than when we started, but we just kept cheering, but then some of the Pep Club leaders decided they wanted to take off there warm-ups, and if more pepole want to take them off well all have to take them off so we did. And we froze but we held in there until the eighth grade game was over. Then we all went home and probubly went to bed, relieved that we had supported our team despite the frigid conditions.
984	18924	7	3	I think patience comes into play in a lot of places. For example, you have to be patient to get a job, or else the boss will kick you right out of the building without saying one word to you. Showing respect and a willingness to learn takes time. Another place you would have to be patient is to be successful. If you moan and groan because something is taking too long to happen, that's not patience; that's frustration. The better thing to do would be to get up and try to do something about it, to actively work towards your goals with persistence. Lastly, if you have to wait for something and not get it right away, like with money from your job, you don't just go rob the place; you have to be patient and you have to wait for payday. Cultivating this virtue is essential for navigating life's challenges and achieving long-term goals.
985	18925	7	3	Once I was at an airport in London. We were coming home from Paris. After we got off the plane we had to go to customs. There were only two people working for UK citizens. The line was very long. After half an hour we were only half way through the line. There was a lot of waiting and a lot whining but we finally made it through. Of course they all thanked us for our patience and once the passport were stamped we were on our way to the next flight.
986	18926	7	3	Once upon a time there was a young girl named LILLY she lived with her dad and mom in a small town of Harmony. It was almost her birthday, and she was so excited because she was turning twelve. Twelve was her lucky number ever since she was little. Her mom said they could go into town and go to chef Ramsey and eat out; she agreed. So that morning she woke up, and dad made her some pancakes with fresh strawberries on them. She went out to go milk their cows for her parents. LILLY hated milking their cows because they are very stubborn, so she went out there and milked the cows in only 10 minutes. LILLY went back inside and put the milk on the table. LILLY was starting to wonder if she was going to get a birthday present. LILLY decided it would be best if she was patient. When her mom came home from work (she works at a dress making store) she said, “Are you ready to go eat?” LILLY jumped and yelled yes, yes. So, they rode into town and parked at the restaurant, they walked in and the lights are off. Her dad got the light switch and all of her close family and friends where there and they yelled “Surprise!” LILLY was in such a shock she yelled “YOU, YOU, YOU,” and on a table were twelve presents, and under the table was a dog. Her mom & dad got her a dog. She named the dog Wonder because every time she saw him she began to wonder about her wonderful life, and she learned that great things come when you are patient, making her birthday one to remember.
987	18927	7	3	Being patient is waiting and not getting frustrated. When my family and I went to [University Name] and [University Name] state game. My dad was patient and that is unusual because he is normally impatient. So we were surprised. When we got in the stadium there was a line of people not thinking and [SOME PEOPLE] sat in our seats so we waited for security to tell them to move. It took about a half an hour for them to find us and again my dad was patient, but the [SOME PEOPLE] at us could not wait and we started to get very angry. When security got there we had to wait for them to google our wrist band he was still patient, and after that we got our seats. I was sad, but the reason my dad was patient was because he did not want to get kicked out of the stadium so he stayed patient and stayed calm. Ultimately, his unusual patience allowed us to enjoy the game without further incident.
988	18928	7	3	When I was at Cedar Point I had a lot of patience. I went to Cedar Point with my friend @PERSON1 last @DATE1 or @NUM1 @DATE1's ago. It was my first time and this was like @PERSON1's @NUM2 time visiting. We went on so many rides but the bad thing was the lines. The lines were huge! At first I wasn’t very patient but after a while I had patience and my friend didn’t. My friend wanted to go on the dragster but I didn’t, maybe because I was a bit nervous. She forgot it was my first time. After hours of riding amazing rides, the lines got longer. My parent didn’t have patience then, but my friend I did. It was funny cause it’s the other way around most of the time. Sometimes I wish people could be more patient, especially in situations like that. But I don’t know if that will happen, though it would certainly make amusement park experiences more enjoyable for everyone.
989	18929	7	3	Do you have patience? Well, if you see her, you're like me. But I know a guy that exemplifies patience; his name is @CAPS1.M. @CAPS1.M holds the secret of patience; what helps him a lot is he doesn't talk much. One time we were at Mercedes-Benz, and we were in a line for three hours! @CAPS2 didn't care though; he was just giant. One time we were outside playing, and we made a whole bee live mess; he got stung five times but didn't complain about how bad @CAPS4 hurt. I have some patience but not as much as @CAPS2. But @CAPS2 isn't perfect; when he's hungry, he has no patience, and I have it on file why. The one time @CAPS2 showed the most patience was when his mom's car broke down in the middle of nowhere. And @CAPS4 was winter out, so the car was cold. @CAPS4; it took nine hours for a tow truck to get there, and that threw his mom over the edge, but not him, until finally, they had a nice meal @PERSON1 took them out, and they went to @ORGANIZATION1 lets to get food. @CAPS2 has the most patience I've ever seen someone have, truly an admirable quality.
990	18930	7	3	One day I went to the store with my mother and there was this old lady in front of us; she couldn't do anything, she was moving very slow. And I know she's an old lady, but she was moving really slow, and I really don't have patience like some people do.
991	18931	7	3	There is only one time a year I'm patient for something, and that is Thanksgiving. I can never wait for Thanksgiving to come. I got to see my brothers, uncles, aunts, cousins, everybody. It is the best time of the year and it is right next to my birthday. It makes the season even more special and full of joy.
992	18932	7	3	"There was a time I had to go to my doctor for a monthly check-up. When we got to the building my aunt and I realized that there were more cars there than usual. When we stepped inside we noticed that a flier said ""Flu shots November 1st through November 30th."" Also, when we took the elevator up to the fourth floor and stepped into the waiting room we saw twenty people. Luckily not all the people were waiting for Dr. Smith, but I did have to wait for an hour and forty-five minutes. Also, when I finally got to see my doctor she gave me my shot and made sure I was okay. After a long day I went home and took a big nap, relieved that the appointment was finally over."
993	18933	7	3	One time I had to be patient was when we went on a family trip to California to see family and friends! We had a big work trip placed out there, and even though our tires were not in great shape, we were patient throughout the trip, like with the flight that took 4 hours, then another 4 hours in the air. For part of the trip, we went along Highway One, which is situated right next to the Pacific Ocean. So, representing a small black sedan, we reached for the first sights. We went to a place looking at some tourist attractions. One side of me was a grassy hill, and the other the ocean. I tried sleeping and listened to the radio for almost 3 hours. We finally stopped in San Francisco. After staying there, we got on a plane for the ride home, a 4-hour flight to Atlanta. It was a long plane with a middle section, and we were in the middle. On both sides of us were college students who would yell across the aisle to the other side. I tried to sleep, but it was very uncomfortable; that was the most uncomfortable plane ride of my life, but I had to be patient and wait until it was over. It was definitely a test of patience from start to finish.
994	18934	7	3	Patience is having control over yourself while you wait. In order to be patient, you have to wait until whatever you are waiting on is done. @CAPS1 means to have composure over yourself. For example, if you go to the doctor's office for a yearly check up, you have to sit in the waiting room for at least one hour before they call your name. But patience is sometimes tested. Like when you are waiting on a pizza restaurant to deliver your pizza; @CAPS1 takes about @NUM1 minutes, but you ask me, an @CAPS1 is, is something someone made up. Not that people have patience. It is a virtue that requires practice and understanding. Ultimately, patience is a skill that can be developed and is essential for navigating life's inevitable delays.
995	18935	7	3	"One day me, my mom, my dad, my sister, my brother went to Fire Mountain. So we had to wait for a long time; the line was incredibly long! Then finally we got to the front of the line. We got our seats then we sat down. Then we had to wait for a long time for a waiter. So we were singing songs until our waiter came. Then she came, and I, being impatient, said ""faster!"" Then she came back with our waiter. Then we got our drinks and our food. Then we ate our food, drank our drinks, then we went home, and that is the time I was patient, or at least tried to be."
996	18936	7	3	One time when I was patient, I got rewarded. Just a few weeks ago, my science teacher gave my class a leaf project. We had to collect @NUM1 leaves to get @PERCENT1. When I started collecting my leaves, I had to press and dry them. To do this to a leaf you will have to put the leaves in newspaper then put books on the newspaper so the water will come out of the leaves on to the newspaper. It takes a long time to do this process and sometimes you half to do this a couple times for each leaf. I had to be patient because the first due date was coming up, but mom said to form my project in the next due date. So since I was patient, my project got done before the second due date and I got @NUM2 extra points. This shows that when you are patient, waiting can lead to positive outcomes, like extra credit, reinforcing the idea that patience can indeed be rewarding.
997	18937	7	3	My mom and I were on our way to our house from Sonco. We got stopped by a train, and it was going very slow, and my mom and I were waiting very patiently. But my mom, after a few minutes, wanted to turn around, but we stayed then, and it was done. The train finally passed, and we were able to continue home.
998	18938	7	3	One time I got birthday money I wanted to buy a electric scooter. On the weekends I always waited for my dad to get home so we could look on the internet. He always got home and we looked, but I never liked any but one day he did not have to work. We looked some and I found two that I liked. One was a gas scooter and one was a electric scooter. We went to look at the gas scooter and it was a lot of money and it had a bounch of snacks on it. We called the person with the electric scooter because I did not like the gas scooter and we went to the parking lot and I got it and I agosumtied it to $200 and it was oriyiek 100 dollars. I got home and rode it for three days and I was using it one night and we went in the garage and it went out of control. We thought it was the fuse, but it was the controller and that the part that everything hooks up to it. We called the company and ordered the part and they sent us the wrong one and we told them it was not the right one and they sent the same one again. It fell off the desk and we forgot about it. Now I ordered it again and they said this time they are sending the right controls. I have been waiting about a year to three months, and hopefully, this time the scooter will be fixed, and I can ride it again.
999	18939	7	3	Patience is, in definition, being understanding and tolerant. I am not patient; I am understanding, but I am not that tolerant. Some people, though, are tolerant and understanding, or patient. Here is a story of someone I know who is tolerant. In the @NUM1 grade, my math teacher's assistant had to be so patient with our class because they would ask the same questions over and over again. She would teach the lesson and then have to reteach it before moving on to practice questions. I was in the advanced group, so we went fast and never really had to ask questions. It seemed like she never got frustrated, always answering with a smile. I could never be as patient as she was teaching those people, as I would have found it difficult to repeat the same explanations so many times without losing my cool. Her ability to remain calm and supportive was truly remarkable, highlighting the essence of patience in a way I still admire today.
1000	18940	7	3	One time I had to wait very patiently. One afternoon my brother @CAPS1 went to pick up some car parts. Then it all happened, out of nowhere a car drifts into his lane then @CAPS2. Since our truck didnít have air bags it was a bad situation. The other driver was in a van with air bags. About @NUM1 minutes later my mom got the call about what happened. Then we rushed as fast as we could to the seen of the crash. I had to wait in the car till my dad got back from going to to get @CAPS1. I waited patiently and I was praying he was alright. And thankfully my prayers were answered. He just got some bumps and bruises. But the car got towed away. We later went to were truck was to get our belongings. And see what happened to the truck the damage on the truck was not nearly bad as what happened to the other drivers van. We got the truck back a few weeks later. But Iím glad I still have my brother.
1001	18941	7	3	I'm going to tell you about the time I had to have patience taking this @CAPS1! It all started a few minutes ago… I came into the classroom prepared for anything. I was clearly not, because four minutes later, I have this thing on front of me. So, I started out by thinking about the time I used patience. This time was as good as any. Now don't get me wrong, I understand why we take the @CAPS1, to…uh, I think it's to help us learn, or make our hands hurt and cramp up, I don't know, really. Writing about patience is very hard because you can lose it very fast. But the @CAPS1 is the @CAPS1, and I think to do my best, so the story must go on! It's very quiet in here, and the smell of pencil and paper are very strong. My eyes are tired, and I can't help but to let out a mighty roar of a yawn. My hand is asleep and every second, you hear a “sniff”, “sniff”, “sniff”… “sniff”, “snot.” We're not aloud to get up, so we're stuck “sniff”, “sniff”, snot-ing all hour long. When you were a kid, whoever is grading this, did you ever take this test, or a section of it? Well, it's none of my business, never mind. Ou! My hand really hurts! One second, (shake, shake, shake, crack) there, that's better. Patience is a virtue, but who cares. You probably don't have the patience to read this so let me finish by saying this… writing about patience, and now, I'm done (yes!), which is ironic, considering the lack of patience I feel trying to finish this assignment.
1002	18942	7	3	One time when I had a lot of patients is when I sprained my arm ice skating. I was doing spins and tricks everywhere, and one I did not land. I fell on my back, but the bone I hurt was my arm; my mom was surprised that I could even stand up because of how hard I fell. My arm was hurting so bad from it. So my mom rushed over to help me, and then we had to go home. The next morning it was hurting ten times more. I had to go to the doctors to get x-rays for it, and they took two weeks to develop. So I was in two weeks of pain, constantly icing it and trying to rest. So it turns out that I didn’t break my arm; however, I was in a lot of pain waiting for the results. It took a lot of patience for me to just wait, and wait, and wait for those x-rays, so learning that it was just a sprain, while relieving, didn't diminish the patience I needed to endure that time.
1003	18943	7	3	It was a cold fall afternoon. My grandpa and I were out on a hunting trip. We had gone out early in the morning @CAPS1, no joke. Little did I know what would happen that day. We got settled into the ground blind at about @NUM1:30 AM. From what we saw, it would be a long afternoon. We sat there @NUM2 hours, @CAPS1 and it seemed like an eternity. We waited and waited, @CAPS1 still no deer. All of a sudden, my heart raced at the sight in front of our blind. We had lured the biggest deer I have ever seen. It was a monster-sized deer, @NUM3: around @NUM4 feet tall, and a @NUM5-point rack. I loaded my @NUM6 .30-06 special and shot it in the shoulder. I was so excited I almost screamed. As in any story, there is a lesson. Some are respect your elders. @CAPS1 But mine is patience is rewarded, and as you can see, I was rewarded, as the long wait ultimately resulted in the successful harvesting of a magnificent animal.
1004	18944	7	3	One time I was patient. I didn’t want a birthday party. So my mom and dad talked about it. So my mom and I went to Dave & Buster's, we got to play almost all the games (didn`t went to play the dum ones) and rode on the go carts twice, then we went and bought a new video game and some new dirt biking gloves. That was a time I was patient so I could do something fun, and it was definitely worth the wait.
1005	18945	7	3	ìPatience is a virtue.î I hear that saying over and over again from my mind. ìpatience is virtue, patience is a virtue.î I never really gave it much thought until I went to babysit my cousins for the first time. My cousin @PERSON2, who is only around @NUM1, does anything you say. Sheís an easy one to babysit. But my other cousin, @PERSON3 he has to go by his own agenda. Not that I donít love him, just that I think he has to be one of the hardest little kid to babysit. We started off pretty good that morning. we had a snack, played in the room for a while, did some arts & crafts, and watched a movie. A few hours before my aunt was supposed to come home, @PERSON1 went poopie in her diaper. Now, Iíve dealt with a lot of poopie diapers before, @CAPS4 I wasnít too worried. I set @PERSON1 on the changing table, and took her diaper off before I realized that I didnít have any wipes. I asked @PERSON4 where they were, but he was playing with those milk pumping bottle things. ì@PERSON4, I need you to go get wipes please. Now.î @PERSON1 was now squirming, and I had to hold on to her if I didnít want poop all over the house. ìI know, but I canítî ìwell why canít you?î ì@CAPS1 I donít want to.î I was started to lose my temper when I realized the saying ìpatcience is a virtue.î I took a deep breath and I realized I was feeling what patient must feel like. ì@PERSON4 Iíll bet you canít go get them as fast as a cheetah!î ì@CAPS2 I can!î ì@CAPS3, prove it.î @CAPS4 he did. And I realized, you will get things done faster if your patcient, and being crafty might just come to you. That little incident taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes, a little patience and creativity can go a long way in getting things done, especially when dealing with children.
1006	18946	7	3	I wondered who would win. I just hoped I would. I was nervous. I was also a little bit scared. I didnít know what was going to happen. I was very patient to hear who won the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 contest. I was waiting for the contest to end .A little bit earlier I played the game. I was currently in first place .I was nervous .I was nervous because if I win I will get two tickets to @LOCATION1ís @CAPS3. I sat quietly in a chair. I tried not to show that I was nervous. All I could do was wait for it to end. Then, my mom said we could wait by riding rides at the fair. First, I went on the tilt I whirl. I was wondering if anybody beat my score during the whole ride. Next, we looked for another ride. I was trying not to think about the contest. Later, we found a ride to go on. When we got of my mom told me that I won. Happily, I walked back to the place to claim my prize. When I was waiting it was scary, but it was worth it. I was nervous the whole time. I tried not to think of it too. I was very anxious I want to do it again some time. I told you when I was patient. When were you? It was worth the anxiety and anticipation, and I would gladly experience that rollercoaster of emotions again for such a rewarding outcome.
1007	18947	7	3	"The thing that annoys one @CAPS1 the most is when people don't ever think about patience. They want the opposite. They don't seem to consider @CAPS1 to @CAPS4's moods. Right then and there with force, they say ""Do it now."" Do you know what I mean? I will tell you about a time where @CAPS6's brother and I tested it. One pill does nothing on its own. This is how it began, walking to the store with @CAPS6's brother because @CAPS6's mom and some others needed it to panic-proof a lot of things. When we got to the place of natural products, we prepared to walk about a mile. Nobody at the store was very nice at all, it guesses the kind of people who were there to steal things. The affect was clear. Only one little note. @CAPS6's brother waltzed down the aisle in search of that bottle. So we passed the produce section, and went to the cleaning supplies aisle for more walking. When we arrived at our destination, there was a woman about to go down the aisle and shop. @CAPS6's brother dashed @CAPS1 down the aisle to go out and got it and started acting bad with the bottle. It was infuriating. He acted impositively, forcing @CAPS4 to beg him to stop. Never mind it. We yelled ""@CAPS4, let's get home and go to sleep!"" @CAPS4 did agree. The whole walk home we gave it to dad, mom. She asked what we bought. She then exclaimed, ""@CAPS5, didn't we read it?"" @CAPS6 was not patient, to blame @CAPS1's impatience. It announced an important reminder to @CAPS1 to practice controlling himself better."
1008	18949	7	3	When I was patient. It was this @DATE1 we were going to this place in @LOCATION1. It to took us @NUM1 hours to get there but we said forget it we were in @LOCATION1. But we were not in @LOCATION1. It was @NUM2 midnight, we were so sleepy we went to Holiday Inn and once we got to the room we went straight to sleep then that morning we went swimming then we left and went to @LOCATION1 park. My two cousins were getting on my nerves. I was about to kill both of them; they kept fighting and talking about each other. Then we finally got there at about @NUM3 pm; we had to take a little train to get there. The park was huge. The first ride me and my sister and my lil cousins was the Comet. Then we got on the, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 Runaway Mine Train, and the @CAPS2, and that was a time when I was patient, despite the challenges of the long journey and the bickering cousins.
1009	18950	7	3	"I was over at my friend's house one afternoon, when she couldn't find something she needed. So we went over to her sister, but she was on the phone, so we sat there patiently until she was done. We had sat there for about seven minutes and both of us were getting impatient. We moved to go ask her mom. I guess she was busy, because she told us to sit, be quiet and patient. We sat there again for seven minutes, but she was still working. So, we got up and went back to her sister. She was off the phone now, so my friend asked her sister where her nail polish was but in a mean impatient tone. ""It's in the drawer! Now get out of my room,"" she yelled. After looking and looking we finally found it. She isn't that patient and I learned I'm not patient either. My friend was still patient but her tone wasn't. That's the time of when I knew someone's patience had worn thin."
1010	18951	7	3	One day I woke up and looked outside; it was snowy and cold. I went to the living room and told my mother that I wasn’t feeling well, so my mother checked my temperature and said I had a fever. I also had a runny nose, so she said I probably had a cold. She had to go to work @DATE1, but she said she would stay home from work to stay home with me. So, she made my hot chocolate and breakfast. Every time I needed something, she just got up and got it for me. Every time I needed something like a drink, food, or even another blanket, she got up and got it for me. She was patient because every single time I asked for something, she got it without complaining; she just did what I asked her to do. She even went uptown to get me my medication. That is why my mother is the best and so patient, always putting my needs first.
1011	18952	7	3	I had to have patient's in the ER of ICU we had to have patient in the ICU. The ICU was very here slow we got ther a while the we saw it at 12 we where in the ICU. For hours and at a breaking pant's at the ICU I was about going to go out to the car and fall a sleep. But I used patient's to go trow that ICU and got the better scering of a person I had patients sowe I can Do something better.
1012	18954	7	3	There was a time when I had to be patient. My family and I were getting @NUM1 pug puppies from a nice lady who lived @NUM2 minutes away. I was so happy when my parents made their final decision about buying them. We visited the puppies @NUM3 more time when they were still really young. After our last visit, we had to wait three whole weeks because they had to be old enough to go home with new families. These three weeks seemed to go by really slowly, but all of the waiting payed off. Being patient gave me a chance to get ready for the puppies. We bought them beds, toys, crates, and other dog essentials. We wanted to be prepared for our new family members. The day finally came to pick up the puppies. They were so adorable! We brought them home and we let them explore all around our house.They loved it! Our pigs turned out to be great dogs. I am so glad that I had to be patient when waiting for our pigs. I guess good things really do come to those who wait!
1013	18955	7	3	"I had patience when my dad did because we had to wait for the doctor to tell us we could see him, but after a while the doctor came and said that he went into a seizer and then a stroke. They sedated him (mydad) and we waited about a good 30 minutes and we used about 2 boxes of tissues. The doctor said that ""we will keep him over night to observe him"". Then the next day went to the hospital and after a while they had to pull the plug. I had patience in that instance because I waited in the lab of the hospital, and waited for the doctor to tell us what happened and when they took the tests and lastly when they said the need to pull the plug on him. Then that's my story about when I had patience."
1014	18956	7	3	I was a patient in the doctor's office, I do believe. I was a patient because I sprained my knee once and fractured my clavicle. That's what made me a patient. I almost forgot about the lump note in my neck, so I am updating my doctor.
1015	18957	7	3	"Sometime it can be hard to be patient, BUT to me it needs to be something I want or want to do. It was a cool day in WASHINGTON D.C. I had just turned 10 and was going to meet president OBAMA face to face! I won a contest that allowed me to do that. As we arrived at the white house a man took us inside. He led us to a little room then left. It was around 9 then. He said we can't come out because we might distract somebody. So we waited played hangman and saws other PEOPLE. Then it was around noon and I was hungry. Around 1:30pm OBAMA came in! He said ""would you like something to eat?""I said ""yes"". We went to this fancy restaurant I can't pronounce. He said sorry BUT having to wait, but I didn't care it was worth it. The experience taught me that anticipation, while challenging, can truly amplify the joy of a desired outcome."
1016	18958	7	3	I show loyalty a lot of people that I know, and they show me loyalty in return, creating strong bonds of trust and mutual support.
1017	18959	7	3	A time when I was patient is when I’m at gymnastics. When you are trying to learn a new skill, patience is the key. For example, when I was learning a new skill on the bars called a cast to handstand it was difficult. Day after day, I never could do it. I put my personal best effort in every day, but I had to be patient, my coach said. He said when the day comes, you’ll do it, but until then you need to keep trying and do the best you can do. It could take days, months, or even a year to get this skill, but I just have to wait until the day my body will do the skill, he said. So I waited and waited, tried and tried, but still no result of getting my new skill. Finally, after four months of doing this I did it. I got up on the bar and did it. All my waiting would be over. That day my coach told me, “I told you that you could do it; it just takes time and patience, but today was your day and you did it.” This is a time I had to use patience to get my new skill. I learned being patient is hard and all you can do is wait and see what patience will bring you, and in the end, the reward is well worth the wait.
1018	18960	7	3	"Book ""And the characters lived happily ever after…for now!"" Lily shut the book, very sad that no more pages were left. This was the third book in her series, and she absolutely just needed the fourth. In the school the next day, she went straight to the library. She opened the doors, and was greeted with that dusty old book smell that she loved. Lily made a bee line for her favorite shelf, holding her favorite books. Lily scanned the shelfs, quickly noticing the book was missing. She asked the librarian, Mrs. Davis, about it, and was surprised to find the book checked out already. She put her name on the waiting list, sour about her name being tenth. The next day was Tuesday. Lily went to the library and asked Mrs. Davis about the book. The results were very disappointing. Her name was ninth, which was pretty good for only one day, but when she was home, she was in a very sour mood. “This isn’t fair!” she asked her mom. “Mom, I really wanted this book, but it was already checked out. My name is ninth on the list, but it could be ages until those other people finish.” “Honey, I think you have to learn some patience” said mom. “Patience? What’s that?” asked Lily “Patience is when you wait for something, and you don’t complain about it. Take you, for example, your being very impatient.” “But I’m waiting” said Lily “No, honey, you are complaning a whole lot.” The next day, Lily was as patient as she could be. She did not go to the library and ask for the book, and she went the whole without complaining. Later on. Lily was called to the office. When she got there, she found Mrs. Davis and Mrs. Smith, the secretary. “Lily!” said Mrs. Davis. “What’s this?” asked Lily “This is the book you wanted. It’s checked out to your acount, and all ready to read.” “Thank you!” said Lily. She couldn’t belive it! She finally got her book! Moral: patience pays off, especially when your willing to wait."
1019	18961	7	3	A time that I was patient was when my family and I were going to get @ORGANIZATION1's autograph at the stadium. We were standing in line for hours waiting. My legs were cramping and paining, but I didn't care; I was too excited to worry about anything. I just wanted his autograph, and eventually I got it, making all the waiting worthwhile.
1020	18962	7	3	One day just before football practice, my lock on my locker got stuck. All @NUM1 of the coaches tried to get it off. All of them except for one, coach @PERSON1. He stayed in the locker room with me trying to get it off. When we realized it wasn't coming off we had to find the @CAPS1. When we found him we asked for bolt cutters. We had to walk all the way across the school to get them. Once we had them we had to walk back to the locker room. When we got there he tried to cut the lock. He tried for @NUM2 min. They wouldn't work. So we had to walk back across the school to the tool room and get another pair. This one finally cut the lock after @NUM3 min. I think this took a lot of patience from coach @PERSON1, who really went above and beyond to help me out that day.
1021	18963	7	3	"For this passage I am going to tell a story about the most patient person in the world. In the old testament long ago there was a man named @PERSON1 who was very rich, very happy and was loyal to God. One day the devil pointed this out and said that @PERSON1 would easily turn away from God. God denied this so the devil said let me destroy his crops and livestock, let me destroy his camels. God said ""fine but do not hurt @PERSON1 himself,"" the devil agreed. When @PERSON1 was having a bad day, yet the next day one of his servants ran in and said ""A great fire has fallen"" and says, ""@CAPS1 your livestock was attacked by wolves, we are the only ones left,"" then another servant ran in and said ""All your livestock was attacked by wolves, we are the only ones left,"" then another servant said ""thieves have stolen @CAPS1 your cold then the servant ran in and said the roof had fallen in the hall, @CAPS1 your family has been killed!"" Even though @PERSON1 was beginning to become a broken shadow living in the ashes, he would not curse God. Soon the devil came again but this time made @PERSON1 horribly sick, even though this went on for years he still would not curse God. When God saw this he sent the devil away and healed @PERSON1. He blessed him with a new family and fortune and then @PERSON1 was happy again, demonstrating his unwavering faith and patience."
1022	18964	7	3	A long wait. I was only four at the time. I had moved to Georgia. Yes, moved to Michigan, Georgia from Texas. Quite a long way down south for me but I was a young little girl who didn’t care too, too much. So I lived in Georgia, went to kindergarden, made friends, moved into a new house, and so on until I was seven. That is when I found out that we were moving. Again, back to Michigan. Well, now I wasn’t four anymore. I had a lot of amazing friends here (in particular two of them) and now I would have to start all over again. I didn’t hate the idea but I didn’t love it either. Of course. It didn’t exactly matter. We were moving anyway and I knew from the beginning that I would easily have fun and make new friends. The only thing I didn’t want to leave behind were the old friends, memories, and all the other stuff I loved about this place. So I took along my memories, promised to keep in touch with friends, and then moved. Novi was different but good. There were plenty of changes to adjust to but it was pretty easy overall. I made plenty of new friends with which I now hang out with everyday. I’ve slipped into life here like you slip into bed every night. What I do is fun and feels like normal. I have now been living here for four years. I have been exchanging letters, emails, events, and memories with friends down in Georgia and friends here all this time. But even so, I long to go back down for a visit. I have been patiently waiting for it to happen. Now, I think that patience is paying off, because I finally get to visit this year. My only difficult has been that I don’t get to see everyone. But not for long. I see all my friends here all the time and now I’ll get to see my older friends too. Yipee for me! I can’t wait! For years of waiting has provided me with an opportunity to reconnect with cherished friendships and revisit a beloved place, making the upcoming visit all the more meaningful.
1023	18965	7	3	When I got bit by a dog I was in Flint when it happened. The dog jumped up and bit me in my face. So my dad and his friend put me in the truck and we went to McLaren, a hospital in Flint. They had me sitting in a hospital bed for two hours. Then I got shipped to Hurley. And then I sat in the hospital watching t.v. still waiting for surgery. Four hours later I got it. So all together I sat for six hours. And all that time it could of got infected. And I got processed a bill so they could keep their profits. But I had to have patience after all I was a patient, and the experience, while difficult, ultimately led to my recovery.
1024	18967	7	3	I am patient every thanks giving and @CAPS1 Christmas. I have to be patient every thanks giving. I get so hungry I start to whine and I have to calm down. On thanks giving we all sit together and wait patiently as we carve the turkey. I get so excited I just keep sniffing. Then oh I can now tell you about the dessert I love it but we eat it like an hour after so I’m hungry then too I very thanks giving smell my aunt’s home made apple pie, oh as soon as they walk in I jump up and down. At @CAPS1 Christmas I have to be patient because I always want to see what presents I get I search everywhere for with my name on it. If I find one that is not for my parents or grandparents tell me we have to wait first. Come Christmas there as I have to open my stocking.  The need for patience at both Thanksgiving and Christmas is evident, driven by anticipation for food, family, and presents.
1025	18968	7	3	Today was @CAPS1 Christmas Eve and @CAPS2 tonight and @PERSON1, the little boy, was so excited, he was bounded off line walls! ìI wonder @CAPS8 what santa @PERSON3 will bring us,î @CAPS3 said @PERSON1, looking through a cat dog,îI want this and this, and this, oh, definently this.î ì@PERSON1, you need to be patient. @CAPS1 Christmas is tomorrow and you need to do your share and help clean the tree,î @PERSON1ís mother says. ì@CAPS4 but I want presents now! ì @PERSON1 whines. ìYou know, ìhis father says with a smile again, ì@CAPS5 if you arenít a good boy @PERSON2 Santa will only bring you peanat shells.î @CAPS6 Fine, @PERSON1 gives in and sets, ë@CAPS7 alright Iíll help.î @CAPS8 It seemed like many many hours later to @LOCATION1 him, it as time to go to bed. He was happy that he had been patient, because he knew, in the @TIME1 morning, he would have presents, bringing a satisfying end to a long day.
1026	18969	7	3	Patience. It was a warm July 12th at 10 AM and I was at my sisterís house playing wii with my niece, when my brother in law matt comes into the living room and says, ìIm bored, lets do something today!íí So we all decided that we would go to michigans adventures for the day. My sister Sarah told us to pack the coler with snacks and drinks and to put pillows and blankets in the back seat of the car. But little did we know that we were actually having six hours to drive to go to six flags and that Sarah, matt and my mom have been planning this for weeks. After being in the car for two hours i moaned ìare we there yet?íí ìno.íí said Sarah ìwere lostî ìohî I replyed. But I really didnít think about how were lost because weve been to michigans adventures a thosand times before. For the rest of ride there i was pretty quiet. In other words I was very asleep. When I woke up it was because my niece was shaking me with excitment. I stretched and squinted from the sunís raise when my eye adjusted to the light I looked around and realised that we were at six flags! When we got in the first ride we rode was the supeman on that ride you sit and things lock around your legs and stomache and i tilts you over so its like your flying we wanted to ride it so bad but the line was 2 and a half hours long. While we were standing in line we found things to do like swing and play on the metal railing, play I spy and all sorts of things and when we finally were on and off the ride I realized that it was really fun, and worth it and that i was patient and didnít complain.
1027	18970	7	3	My mom is very patient. The reason why my mom is patient is because when she goes to the beauty shop she calls two hours of waiting not a long time. Another reason she is patient is because if I don't do my chores she dozent get very upset she just ask me to do it again. My mom is also very patient when it comes to work because she does not get frustrated when she has a lot of work to do like writing a 2000 word paper. These examples show just how patient my mom truly is in various aspects of her life.
1028	18971	7	3	Patience is our waiting. Patience is dealing with teachers at school and trying to understand their point of view. Without patience, you and your younger teacher would constantly be fighting. That's why patience is so important. Patience should be constantly exercised. In sports, it helps; you need to respect the ref, whether it's a good or bad call. Patience also matters because you're not going to be good at it the first time. Patience makes perfect. School is a great place to use patience, whether learning something new or dealing with an annoying teacher. You need to use it while dealing with children because they are always trying to get reactions out of you, whether they’re being bad. In the end, it's a skill to call your own. It's very important to have that skill, whether its small things like learning or big things like testing. It's better to have patience than not, so it is a beneficial trait to cultivate.
1029	18972	7	3	In my life there has been many times were I have been patient and times when have hot been patient. For example the other day I asked my mom if she would drive me to target I could got gum. My mom said yes but I had to wait a little bit. I was patient by waiting for my mom to take me. When I got to target my mom told me to hurry up. I ran into the crowd in the pay line so I had to wait. Instead of getting all mad I was patient. Also instead of my mom getting mad she was also patient. One example of me being impatient is, about a week ago when I asked my dad to play catch with me. He said yes but you have to wait a while. I got very mad for some reason and lost my patience. I started yelling why I have to wait. I then realized I was having a fit and that I lost all patience. I said sorry and then we played catch. These experiences have shown me that patience is a virtue that I need to continue to cultivate, even when it's challenging.
1030	18973	7	3	Patience is one of the things that people need to have. I remember when I was in the store and my cousin wanted to go home, and her mom was being slow and said wait. My cousin was impatient that day because she wanted to go home quickly. I think that patience will help you go through life. For an example, if you were going out with your friend and she was driving, and you got tired and wanted to go home and said let's go. Then you were the one that was impatient because she was the one driving and needed to focus. Patience will always be one of the things we have to do. If you are patient, you could do things much better. You have to sometimes wait for managers to call you to get the next job you applied for. But can't be impatient, or you won't get hired for that job because you might come across as demanding or pushy. You always have to be patient because you don't know what would happen if you didn't be patient, and it could lead to missed opportunities or strained relationships.
1031	18974	7	3	@CAPS2 @CAPS1, @CAPS2-@CAPS1, @CAPS2-@CAPS1! The sound ratling through @CAPS11 cars. All I can think about is after @CAPS6 and lunch. I grow more impatient as the clock ticks and @CAPS11 heart throbs. I do not like the meap for that reason. During the reading selection all I think is, ‚Äú@CAPS7 has to be the most boring story in history ‚Äúthen I turn the page, @CAPS8, @CAPS7 one is, ‚Äú@CAPS9 makes me so impatient. All I wanna do is finish the test. Little beams of sweat read @CAPS9 slow but I do not want to be the last to turn @CAPS9 in. In the writing I think ‚Äú@CAPS10 am I going to write about?‚Äù @CAPS11 hand starts to ache, and @CAPS11 head will pound because of everyones pencil running as if @CAPS9 were in a horror film. @CAPS2-@CAPS1, scribble-scribble, eek-eek, bom, bom, then you have to read over and over, make sure you have a title and read hand writing. The most nerves working of all, is the math segment. There are question I forgot. All the math teachers seem to cram all of @CAPS9 in @CAPS11 head at once. @CAPS9 is absolutely terrifying. Then while your testing, there is someone who can sit still and their desk starts rattleing. Well, if anyone could not tell, one, I am very impatient and two, I do not like the meap. @CAPS2-@CAPS1 is the most annoying sound. Along with many others, I am trying to get a good score. @CAPS2- @CAPS1, little, beams of sweat, libom bom, eek, eek scribble- scribble. All of these things contribute to my overall dislike for the test, but I’m determined to push through and do my best despite these distractions.
1032	18976	7	3	One time I was patient was when me, my dad, @ORGANIZATION1, and @CAPS1 were going to @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @LOCATION1. Me, @ORGANIZATION1 and my dad wanted to ride the Millennium Force. So we waited in line for two hours in the hot sun. Some of the difficulties were that the ride was having some problems, causing delays. So, after the long wait, when we finally got to ride, it turned out okay.
1033	18977	7	3	On October 26th I was with my dad at 6 am. I was sitting watching hoping something would come & all of a sudden I grew tired & I fell asleep for an hour. When I woke up I was watching but nothing came for an hour as I was waiting & waiting & waiting. Then from many night I heard leaves cracking & I thought is it really true. On my first day I would shoot one I saw one. I was a little too excited! I reached to get my gun too quick & he ran away. On another day we came out I saw another dies but to my left this time. But I got my gun even slower this time & BAM I aimed & fired! Well thatís what I thought but no it was jamed and BAM I had to unload it. Then my dad called me over the walky-talky, & asked ìwhat are you doing.î BAM I said ìI see a doe,î BAM he said ìthen shoot it,î & it stood there BAM I shot again & then it ran away, ìI missedî I said all that patience for nothing. It was a frustrating day of hunting, highlighting the challenges and disappointments that can come with it.
1034	18978	7	3	I walked into the big open room. The smell of crayon, animal crackers and dirt overcome the air and hit my nose like a big wave rolling in from the sea. I take my first nervous steps into the room. The floor is covered with toys and a lot of crayons. The kindergartners are running around screaming like little animals that heard they were about to be eaten for dinner. The teacher is standing right in the middle of it all. She has a distant look in her eyes and she looks like she’s about to cry. When she sees me and my name tag her face lights up a little bit. She practically runs at me with arms open. The teacher introduces herself then says they’re all mine. I never would have realized student teaching would have me doing so much teaching. I knew I’d do a little but as the teacher introduced herself, then said she was leaving and I had to teach them the alphabet. So I was stuck with 25 kids and a “war.” I eventually, with some grabbing and pulling involved, get the kids to sit down criss-cross apple sauce on the floor. It’s too bad I underestimated how wild they were. As I begin, one of kids starts throwing toys at me, so as calmly as possible I half growled, “NO BILLY, that’s not nice, please stop.” Billy stops for about two way too short seconds. So this repeats and I end up doing this with all the wild eyed, crazy haired dwarfs. It took a lot of stinking patience to get them to finally sit still. We got to about H when the kids got fussy again. At that point I was feeling more like a babysitter than a teacher. I was gradually understanding how that teacher was willing to leave. Finally I get that light bulb going off in my head feeling I run to my purse grab my bag of candy and say, “when we finish learning the alphabet A-Z, anyone who can say the whole thing will get a piece of candy!” I realized to them that’s like gold to an adult. I was amazed and couldn’t believe my ears. Every kid learned A-Z, I actually ran out of candy, although it took a lot of patience and pointless bickering. When the bell rings I hastily leave to go home. It took a lot of patience but I did it, and reward myself. I slept! The day was a challenge, but managing the chaos and successfully teaching them the alphabet, even with the help of sugary incentives, felt like a significant accomplishment, making the exhaustion well worth it.
1035	18979	7	3	A day that I was patient was, one day I was really happy about my birthday coming up. I couldn't wait to see **what gifts** I was getting. I thought about it for about a week begging my mom to tell me **what** I was getting. The days passed and it felt like they got even longer and longer. I tried and tried day and day to try and take a peak at **what presents** I was getting, but I always got caught. So finally my mom told me to just stop thinking about it and be patient and it would **come** faster. So I waited, it seemed like it was taking forever. The next day I woke up my brother came and jumped on me and said “ah-ah I know **what presents** you're getting and you don't.” And I jumped up and said “**What presents**! How come you know and I don't? “That's bad tell me please” And he said no “then I got up and walked out the room and went to my mom and said “I give up” she looked and said just be patient and it will go by faster you only have four days left. “then I walked away. Then days started to go by faster and then my birthday came up I was so happy to finally see **what gifts** I was getting. And that was the day I was patient, learning that sometimes waiting makes the reward even sweeter.
1036	18980	7	3	A time when I am patient is when I want something really bad, like a phone or to get on the computer. But that is not the only way to be patient; you have to be patient in church and in the doctor's office, so there are many ways to be patient. Showing patience in those situations can be challenging but rewarding in the long run.
1037	18981	7	3	I was patient when I had to wait in a very long line at leader SIX FLAGS amusment park! In CALIFORNIA I had to wait for THREE hours for the ride, The GIANT DROP. It went from ZERO to SEVENTY in SECONDS! When going SEVENTY the coast went strate up then, stoped at the top (FOURTY yard) we just sat their for like FIFTEEN sec! Then it moved and we went strate down at NINETY it was relly cool! It was werth the wait. That was the time I was patient!
1038	18982	7	3	It takes a lot of patience, especially when you are travelling for 24 hours straight. When I was 12 we went to Europe for half a year. Me, my mom, and my dad left at 4 am for the airport. We waited there for a long time. When we finally got on the plane, we took the hour-long flight to Chicago. Then a 6 hour flight to Los Angeles. We waited in those airports for a long time. Then came the 13 hour flights to Dubai. That was the longest flight I’ve ever been on. The plane was a huge double-deck 747 jet. Then we took the 3 hour flight to hawk bay. It was a really long trip. It took a ton of patience. Well, we went there because my dad was making a golf course. That takes a lot of patience too but, it's a lot more fun. That was the most patient I’ve ever had to be, but in the end, it was worth the wait.
1039	18983	7	3	"Last year I went to New York City with my mom, my step-dad, 3 of my brothers, my aunt Beth and, her 2 kids Peter and Jack. The first place we went was the Statue of Liberty. We got in line for the ferry that takes you to the island where the Statue of Liberty is. The line was huge and antic. I thought, ""Oh great"" because it was nearly 100 degrees outside and we were going to be waiting here for at least an hour. After about a half hour I noticed that the line goes into a building. What was in there? I wondered. All of the kids except me were complaining, and my parents were starting to get irritated we finally got in the building and guess what, another gigantic line! Yov what fun! At least the building was air conditioned. We had to go through metal detectors and stuff before we got on the ferry. The ferry ride wasn't bad but it was quite full. On the bright side we got to sit down. We all got off the ferry and looked up at Lady Liberty. It was actually really big unfortunately they closed down the part where you get to go inside it because it was so hot. Oh well it was cool enough seeing it. We walked around the entire island and were trying to find the ferry. We found the ferry and waited in the line again until we got on the boat. I was proud of myself for not complaining. Apparently my mom was too because when we got back to the hotel she pulled me aside and thanked me for being so patient, making it all worthwhile."
1040	18984	7	3	Patience is like waiting your turn to talk or waiting for something to load; it's also about enduring delays calmly. Patience can be helpful in many ways, such as waiting until you get to your destination while traveling or waiting for the person you called to answer the phone so you can finally talk. Patience also allows you to experience difficulties without complaining or becoming overly frustrated. Cultivating patience allows us to navigate life's inevitable delays and challenges with greater ease and composure.
1041	18985	7	3	A kid wakes up. He goes upstairs to get a drink. He goes back down and watches cartoons. He becomes very excited when he remembers he gets to go to a football game today. The Sharks are playing the Lions. His dad comes downstairs and tells him to get ready for the game. They drive about 50 miles to the Sharks stadium. They get there find their seats. The game starts. The Sharks kickoff. The Sharks stop them and by the end of the first half the Sharks are down. The score was 28 to 10. You can already see people leaving. Then comes the second half. Now at the end of the third quarter, the Sharks are down 35-17. More and more people leave. The Sharks are coming back. We are still here. Now down by 10, the Sharks get another touchdown. They are only down by three. 15 seconds left. Quarterback Culler throws a Hail Mary pass to the endzone. The crowd goes wild. We were patient enough to stay till the end of the game, and our patience was rewarded with an incredible victory.
1042	18986	7	3	This story a story about when I broke my ankle. It happened about @NUM1 years ago. I was at swim practice and was about to dive off of lane @NUM2. When I lost my balance getting on the block, I realized I was about to fall and tried to catch myself, but, I ended up falling in to the water and twisted my ankle backwards from the swim block. I was really hard to get out of the water. My mom called the doctor and found out that I couldnít got an x-ray for nearly four days. So she came to the pool to get me and brought her old crutches. Those four days passed of laying in my bed felt like forever, when I come to find out that my ankle was broken. So I ended up spending @NUM5 weeks not going to swim practice, I was so bored. That was the time when I had to be patient for four days until I got an x-ray. It taught me a lesson about patience.
1043	18987	7	3	Ok it was atime wen I was on a bus to got texas. My mom, and my family was going to see my great grandfather. The bus smelt good but same lady kept spraying perfume so i had to just sleep and snack on a couple snacks. I kept gettting woke up by a baby crying. Everytime i hold to go to the bathroom there was always someone in the bathroom. Also when i was trying to sleep every one seems to get louder. So when it was time to catch some z's my bus driver would wake us up us and we would have to get off the bus to another bus. It seemed like we were never going to arrive on that bus. You had to have alot of patients or you wouldnít be able to to just relax when the day is done. I finally got there in three days. It was worth it because we went to six flags. If I didnít have patience then the experience of being on a bus for three days would have been a horrible experience, but in the end, it led to a fun vacation.
1044	18988	7	3	"One time I showed patience was when my friend said they saw something that I wanted for a long time. As soon as I got home I charged towards the computer to see if it was still available. ""@CAPS1,"" I said triumphantly, it was still there. It had taken me such a long time to save up for it. As I quickly went through the order info I was thinking, ""@CAPS2 is will be so amazing once I get @CAPS2."" @CAPS3 I pressed the confirm order button @CAPS3 and sighed; now for the hard part, the waiting. I went to school the next day and the next, and for a week @CAPS2 continued to occupy my thoughts, how cool it would be to finally get @CAPS2. I took the long bus ride home. @CAPS3 I got off, waiting impatiently for it to come. I surged over to the mailbox to get the mail and I found a box. My heart leaped and beat faster @CAPS3 I ran inside and tore it open, and there it was, my @CAPS4, new iPad back! I was so, so happy, and all of my patience had paid off. I had got it."
1045	18989	7	3	"There was this day not too long ago that I had to wait. Nothing but wait. It was at basketball tryouts when we were finding out if we made the team. I had to wait, and wonder if I made it. I thought to myself, ""I wonder, I wonder if I pushed enough, I wonder if I messed up too much."" All I could think about were the mistakes I made, so that day, that time that I had been sitting down waiting to hear my name, I heard my name! ""@PERSON1 number @NUM1 tryouts please come get your paper."" I got it, took it outside, opened it, and read. ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 you had made the gold team."" I jumped up and down. That day I had my patience, and therefore, I made the team, proving that waiting can be worthwhile."
1046	18990	7	3	Two summers ago I went to Canada and New York. We had to drive for 10 hours straight. I mostly just sat in the back seat and listened to my MP3 player. That car ride was very boring. On the way I looked for licence plates with different states on them. We were half way there so we stopped at a dunkin donuts, That was early in the morning, my sister and I got donuts and hot chocolate. Then we got to a whole bunch of little booths were you have to show your passport to got in. And finally we were in Canada. We stayed there for 3 or 4 nights. Then we were on the rode again for 6 hours to go to New York. When we got there, all the patience paid off. And thatís a time when I was patient. The journey was long, but the destination made it worthwhile.
1047	18991	7	3	I was about 6 years old. It was a gorgeous day outside. The best part is that it was my birthday. All of a sudden I had a brainstorm. I was going to try and ride my bike with no training wheels. So I ran inside as fast as my little feet would let me go. I went straight through the front door and I yelled ìMum, Dad, come quickly I have something to tell you.î ìWhat is it buddyî my sister screeched as she ran down the stairs. ìThis is importantî I yelled. ìEveryone is coming.î ìHold on sweety you have gotta wait, your son wants us to here it, it must be important.î ìit is, it is, it is,î ìHold on mum we can meet him outside.î ìOkay, we will be outsideî ìokî ìHold on lets go.î My sister and my mum ran outside to wait for Dad and that was a time that I was patient. I waited for everyone to gather so I could share my exciting news.
1048	18993	7	3	"I don't have a mother who is busy all the time, but you do. For some reason you like to travel everywhere with her. One day you went to a place that you forgot the name of. You were so patient even though being patient is hard because you really don't have anything to do. @CAPS1 took her like @NUM1 minutes. You were happy when you left but you didn't say things like, ""Come on,"" ""Hurry up,"" ""@CAPS1's taking too long,"" ""@CAPS2's hungry,"" ""@CAPS2's ready to leave,"" and things like that, showing remarkable self-control and consideration for your mother's activities."
1049	18994	7	3	When I was patient I asked my mom to buy me a bike and I had to wait and wait for like two weeks for a bike. On my birthday I wanted a fish, and I asked my mom to buy me a fish. She didn’t say anything so I kept asking and asking and asking. So I stopped asking for three days, then she got me a fish, then it died. Four weeks later then I asked for a turtle and she said yea she will. Then I waited and waited until she got me one. Then I was happy; that’s when I was patient, and it made the reward feel even better.
1050	18995	7	3	One time my sister and my mom were impatient when I went to Dick's Sporting Goods because I wanted a new bag, Adidas sandals, and crazy socks. Well, it took me hours to pick out socks; there were zebra, stripes, blank, plaid, and dots. So my sister did not get to get anything because she did not have money. Finally, I just picked the zebra ones. Then I had to find the Adidas, but I could not find them, so like an hour later, they only had one left in white that were my size, but this girl took them right off my feet and took them, so I looked at my mom, and she was nappy as can be. So then I went to get a bag; they had one pink left, so I grabbed it and went home, relieved the shopping trip was over, even if it wasn't perfect.
1051	18996	7	3	I do not have much patience because this year I'm getting a laptop. Every day I look one up, and I can't download anything on my iPod. I keep talking to my family about it; I do not go a second without thinking about my laptop. I have everything ready for one, but I have to wait. Waiting for a laptop is not the only thing I had to have patience for. Last year for Christmas I got an iPod, but I had to wait till Christmas eve because my family pitched in; we bought it on black Friday. So I looked at YouTube videos on iPod Touches because I could not wait any longer. It is hard to have patience when you want something so badly, especially when you almost have it. Ultimately, learning patience is difficult, but it's a skill I need to develop to better handle anticipation and delayed gratification.
1052	18997	7	3	"A time to be patience is all the time; if you are not patience, you will run all the time (I have here there). You will never have time for your family and yourself, like my [mother] tells me when I'm eating, ""Slow down, you're not going nowhere."" If your food was about to go somewhere, you would not [catch it] because you are too tired to do it. Always take your time to learn how to be patience; it is easy, just take your time, and you will find the peace you seek."
1053	18998	7	3	One day me and my mom dad and sister were going to Orlando to go to unversual it is a attraction place. Me and my dad are walking he asking me if I want to go on this rollor coastor called the duling dragons. I wasnít to sure about this because it was my first time on a rollor coastor so I say no but I never knew if I liked rollor coastors so I said fine lets go. Waiting in line we waited to 1 hour and 30 minutes in that period of time I would just watch the other people that were haveing there turn and I look for the first time and the rollor coaster was going like 60 miles per hour from where I was looking so there is still like 4 people in front of us so I was like when our we going and it feels like the time is going slower ,and slower and slower so I was like finally our turn is ni 5 more times fanilly I group goes its ours I take my sun glasses and my dad takes his sunglasses and we sit in the front its ours here it goes climbing the track and I was like ok this is fun then we go like 70 miles per hour I cant even scream we our going so fast then we go up side down and twich and stuff then it ends I was like no no no I like rollor coastor and that is the time I was patience. Now I know I am a fan of roller coasters, and that experience taught me the value of patience.
1054	18999	7	3	On a morning recently when every one of my family members wake up at 6 or 7 oíclock am. Me my brother and my sisters told my mom ìcan we play the game and the labtop.í Mom said sure but you guys have to wait until each otherís turnî and we said ìok.î Then we played it. Each person had one and a half hour to play on both things .I let my brother and sister s play first because Iím the oldder one and I have to wait ptiencetly until it was my turn. Well until it was my turn we would have to take playing the game on the things, we wold do that until the day was done. Or until tomoro was done. That wold be it until next week or until we can play it again. And thatís what I say I do as being patience at home and the respect my brother and sisters, showing that patience and respect are important aspects of our family life.
1055	19000	7	3	There were many times when I was patient. There was a time when I was patient for a whole month. I was getting a new basketball video game, but it didn't come out until a month later. So I had to be patient. I could not wait until the game came out. It seemed like it took forever. It was the day before the game came out, and I lost the money that I was going to use to get the game. So then I had to save up @NUM1 more dollars to buy the game that I wanted. I had to get two @DATE1 jobs so that I could make the money that I lost. So two weeks passed by, then I went to the game store so I could buy the game. When I walked into the store, the manager told me there were no more copies of any basketball games. So I had to be patient for a whole nother @NUM2 weeks, and I got very mad. So I waited @NUM2 weeks for the game, and I finally got the game. I was so mad I had to be patient that long, but I got what it was worth. So that is my story about being patient, and in the end, even though it was frustrating, my patience was rewarded.
1056	19001	7	3	A time when I was patient was at my grandma's house in Miami. My cousins and I had to wait for my grandma to get home before we could go to the beach. After about an hour of waiting, my cousin and I started to play video games to entertain ourselves, and the time went faster. My grandma had probably worked for eight hours. At three pm, I decided to watch a movie. I had been patient for the whole movie, and in the middle of the movie, my grandma got home. We all waited patiently till she was ready to go to the beach, and it was a great relief to finally head out. This was a time when I had been patient.
1057	19002	7	3	I remember a time when someone I know was patient with me. It was near the beginning of the @NUM1 grade. I had enrolled in band that year, playing the trumpet. We played songs and had tests to see if we were playing right. But on my tests, my band teacher <@NUM2</PERSON> noticed something funny. I was playing the wrong notes. He told me I needed a long private lesson if I wanted to play my notes right. So one afternoon after school, I took the lesson. I started by playing my notes for him. He said they were wrong. Then <@NUM2</PERSON> broke down the notes for me one by one. He told me the correct way to play the notes. He had me play the notes again and again and together. When I messed up, he showed me how to play them being very patient with me. Then finally I was playing every note right. The lesson was about @NUM4 minutes and he was patient the entire process. Now I play my notes right; that’s thanks to the lesson and @PERSON1’s patience. Now I know that if I need more lessons in the future, I can count on <@NUM2</PERSON>’s patience to come through whether or not there are required classes.
1058	19003	7	3	This year I tried out for the @NUM1 grade volleyball team for my school. There were so many girls trying out that I was nervous for what team I was going to get on or if I even would make a team. So I worked my hardest and figured, I had had experience from the other teams I was on before and I was now confident I would make the team. After @NUM2 of tryouts they had grouped us into either The A, @CAPS1 or intermural team, according to your skill level. We got a letter that afternoon, and I made it into the A team! We then got right into practice and games, focusing on strategy and teamwork. Winning most of the games, and improving on working as a team. Then a couple days ago, we played against @ORGANIZATION1 middle school. As @ORGANIZATION1 middle school, we obviously were rivals and were determined to beat them. For ìbragging rigts,îwe joked, but most important because we really wanted to do our best. The first game was very close, but we won, and I played about half the time, serving, hitting and moving all around the court. I felt very confident, in the second game also, even though I didnít play as much as I wished. I still had fun! In the game of volleyball, you play @CAPS2 games in a match. The best two out of @CAPS2 wins the match. At that time we had won both of the games, which ment we won, however we still had to play the third game. Even though we won the match our coach wanted us to win all @CAPS2! Pretend like itís the winning point, and play your hardest, she would say. So as the third game started, I was on the bench with some of the other players. I waited till about half of the game and wondered when I would be in. Time had gone by and I was getting discoureged because I hadnít played yet. I asked the coach a couple of times if I was going in or not, but she was too busy watching and coaching. So I sat, and about I point before the game ended, she looked at me and said, îcan you do it?îI shot right up and subbed in. I whent to the back of the line, tossed the ball in the air, and hit it! i had made the winning point! In the end I learned to trust my coach and to have patience, because it usually is for the best! But boy did I have a great time serving the winning point, and it really taught me a valuable lesson about teamwork and perseverance.
1059	19004	7	3	The word patience means a lot of things. It can mean waiting for something and much more than that. It also talks a lot about enduring difficult situations. It takes time and effort to cultivate. I'm the type who complain a lot and I don't have patience. Other people, they don't complain; they handle it. A lot of teenagers have no patience. As you get older you develop patience, but some adults don't have patience; it depends on if you work at it. It also depends on what the person has gone through in life, as challenging experiences can shape one's capacity for patience. Ultimately, patience is a virtue that requires conscious effort and is often influenced by life's circumstances.
1060	19005	7	3	My mother is the most patient person I know. When she drops me off at practice she waits two and a half hours for me to cheer, fly, and dance the whole routine. When I go to science programs she waits at least two hours until it's over. Every morning she waits on me to finish getting ready, even when I take longer than expected. After school, she waits on me to buy something at the table in the lobby, patiently observing my choices. All that she asks is for us to return the favor, showing her the same consideration she gives us. She doesn't rush us unless we're late, understanding the importance of taking our time. And she always hugs us before we leave, a comforting reminder of her love and support, making her patience all the more appreciated.
1061	19006	7	3	"Patience I was patient when I did not want to go to Wisconsin. I was patient on my way there (driving). I was patient when I was fishing, not complaining how boring it was. I wasn't happy about sleeping on the ground. The whole camping trip I was patient. Story begins. Wisconsin, took 7 hours. In the car had a t.v. I watched that for a while and then I looked outside and saw a moose! I screamed, ''moose!!'' my roomate's boyfriend, Mike, stopped and backed up and that was my first time seeing a moose. Then when we got there we set up our tent and then went fishing. I was patient for the fish to bite my worm. I was so patient I got 2 fish that day. Then when we came back i had to sleep on the ground. There were bumps and rocks under me, but I didn't complain because that's how camping is. The next day we were on our way back and I couldn't find the t.v. and didn't have a drink. I had to go to the bathroom. A sign said, ""a gas station on exit 3"". I was patient, went to the bathroom and to get a water. Because of my patience during the trip, I was able to enjoy the experience despite the inconveniences, and that made the trip worthwhile."
1062	19007	7	3	One day there was a little boy named Timmy. He was really hungry and his mom was a slow cooker. She would take forever to get done cooking. Timmy was starving and he was getting real unpatient with his mother. Timmy went outside to play with has friends. He came back home and was wishing dinner was ready. He went in the kitchen and said “mom is dinner ready”. “Almost right now” said mom. It won’t be ready until another hour. Timmy was thinking what can he do until dinner is ready so he went to go to play his video game. It was a space ship game. The space ship was shooting other space ships to survive. Timmy got bored so he went in the kitchen to see was dinner ready. His mom wasn’t finish so Timmy tried to be patient and his mom was finish less than five minutes. He was so happy that he would finally get to eat.
1063	19008	7	3	Patience is when you wait for something without complaining. A time I was patient is when I was 10 years old. It was about 70 degrees that day but the winds were picking up just a little. I was being patient so I could go on a ride in Dorney Park adventures. It was Shivering Timbers. The line was very long, and when I mean very, I mean long. It took me about a half of an hour to get on the ride. Another ride I waited for was the STEEL FORCE. But that one was shorter. It only took about 15 minutes. All these rides have to show patience because if I didn’t show patience, I wouldn’t be riding the good rides. The last one is when I was 12. I wanted to ride the Thunderhawk, and the line took like a whole hour. I played my Nintendo as while I was waiting so I could be patient. An hour later, I got to ride that ride all because of patience. Ultimately, displaying patience allowed me to experience many thrilling rides.
1064	19009	7	3	Patient is when you are listening and tolerant of how someone feels. My mom and dad are very patient with me and my sister. My sister just came and moved in with us; she is 20 years old. She came to live with us. It's hard to have a new person in the family; you always have to get one extra thing like an extra plate, spoon, fork, pizza, supplies, and things she needs for school. Since we have to get stuff, we have to work harder; my sister doesn't do all the things that I'm used to, and my parents are more patient and forgiving to her, but I know why. Sometimes my mom and dad are always changing and mean, but then she would—I would get in trouble for—she's older than me but is not used to the way we do things around our home. I look up to my parents; they are so nice to everyone, and even though it's different now, they are still patient, showing me the importance of understanding and compassion even when things are in flux.
1065	19010	7	3	I do not have patience. It's a feeling many experience, stemming from a desire for immediate results. This lack of patience can manifest in various aspects of life, hindering progress and creating frustration. Learning to cultivate patience, while challenging, is essential for long-term success and overall well-being, fostering a calmer and more productive approach to tasks.
1066	19011	7	3	This is a story about a time when I had to be patient. This happens every year I’m pretty sure every one knows about it. It is called birthday. Every year I have to wait for @NUM1 days for my birthday to come. It takes a while, but I know I have to be patient. Being patient is hard work but usually pays off. Another way that I have to be patient is waiting for the @CAPS1 tests to get over. But I always remember it has to end sometime. So I have to sit there do the work and be patient. It is not always easy, but I know that eventually the tests will be over and I can relax. Therefore, in different ways, patience is a virtue that I have to practice.
1067	19012	7	3	I played soccer for a rec team called the Cheetahs. Rec means I was in the best division possible. Rec soccer was fun, but my two best friends and I were doing all the work; no one else on the team was contributing. So I decided to try out for a select team. A select team is in the second-highest division. When tryouts came, I was really nervous about whether I was good enough. After I tried out for three days, the coach said that if you were selected, you would get a phone call. It felt like it took forever to get a phone call; it felt like it took a country's worth of time. In between those days, I had to wait, and wait, and wait, and wait, and so on; when you wait for a long period of time that's called patience, and it was something I really had to practice during that stressful week. Ultimately, developing the patience to wait was a valuable lesson, regardless of the outcome of the tryouts.
1068	19013	7	3	I think patient is when some one is able to wait and not complain. I was never patient, so here is a story I have made up. One day there was a girl named Lily. She really wanted to go to the park. But she still had to do her homework, chores, take care of her sister and clean up the rest of the dinner. She was really busy. She started with her homework first because all she had was a math worksheet – 10 problems on each side. Which was easy because they were all addition and subtraction. That took her 15 minutes, (7.5 on each side) which isn’t that bad. Next she did the chores. Her chores were to clean up her room and the living room because her sister toys here all over the place from before. But luckily her sister was asleep. Now that she’s resting and not making more of a mess, it took Lily about 5 minutes to clean up all the toys because all she had to do was throw them back into the toy bin. Now , we go to her room. Ally's messy room you first couldn’t open the door. So she had to tug on the door until she could finally fit her self in. The door slammed shut from all the clothes but luckily didn’t wake up her sister. Lily first made a check list of what she needed to do she had to: vacuum, fix her bed , and put all the food away that were in her room back in the kitchen. That took about 1 hour and a half. So in all that’s been about 1:45 minutes. Now all she had to do clean up the rest of the dinner. Her mom couldn’t because she had to drop off her dad at the air port for work, so it was up to her. But the bad thing is that they had spaghetti for dinner and her sister spilled the sauce all over the floor so she had to mop. So right away she cleaned the table which took 8 minutes, mopped which took like 5 minutes, when she was finally done, her sister woke up and she had to feed her and then she could just take her with her to the park. She gave her some apples and then when they finally finished, she took her sister with her and they had a great time, proving that even without patience, things can work out in the end.
1069	19015	7	3	I have had to be patient a few times in my life. Some times we have to be patient at the doctors, waiting for new game and movie releases. But I am going to tell you about a time I had to be patient at an airport. One time I had to be patient at an airport. The problem wasn't waiting for the plane to arrive or the line for our ticket. We had to wait because all the planes were down. We had to sleep there overnight. I was being as patient as I could, but my grandma didn't like how we had to wait over an hour just to get into the food court and then another hour just to get our food. It was very crowded, and it took all my patience to not get angry at all the other people. It was a true test of endurance. Some examples of how I was feeling about my patience is picture being at the doctors, long car rides, or maybe even waiting for a test score, and there are many other things. Make sure you work on patience and stay calm; it will help you navigate difficult situations like that airport experience.
1070	19017	7	3	I think that my coach is patient because there are @NUM1 girls she is watching. She has to teach us stuff that we don’t know. Our coach has to teach us stuff like the @CAPS1 play and teach us how to do moves like cross overs. She teaches us to run fast, she has to be patient with the slower kids that can't ran as fast. Our coach had to be patient when she was handing out jerseys because we all had to try them all and it took a little of her time, so she had to be patient. Because of all these things, I believe my coach demonstrates a lot of patience.
1071	19018	7	3	We all don't like waiting, but we have to learn to be patient. @DATE1 @DATE1 @DATE1 when I went to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 I had to be patient for a lot of things. I had to be patient when waiting in the airport and using public transportation. Being patient means you are understanding and tolerant. Over my trip I had to do a lot of waiting in airports, all while still being patient. Being extra patient was important when waiting for your flight to be called. Another place to be patient was when I had to wait for my bag to come on the baggage carousel. Another long wait was at airport security, where patience was key. To sum up, you have to be patient waiting in airports. When I went to @LOCATION1 @DATE1 I had to be patient when using public transportation. When waiting for a train to arrive, it was rush hour and the train was full. When I was in the taxi, there was traffic outside, so I relaxed and was patient. To conclude, I had to be patient when using public transportation. I still don't like waiting in line, but I am patient when I do. I learned patience when waiting and being delayed, but it's something we have to do, and it ultimately made my trip more enjoyable.
1072	19020	7	3	When me and my dad were inline for the Kencer Hauck at @LOCATION1 adventures! I had to wait patiently to get on. The line was massive so many people ahead of us and it was shocking that so many others were in line for this roller coaster we waited for what seemed like hours but was only minutes, and as we got closer it was getting hard to be patient. Finally we got on the ride and it was insane so waiting for those minutes that seemed like hours was definitely rewarded with a thrilling experience.
1073	19022	7	3	"One time I at the @ORGANIZATION1 drive-thru. We had already got our food and we were waiting to get it so we could eat. We waited for about ten minutes. Then finally our food came! We looked at the food they gave us and we got all the wrong food and no drinks. So my mom had to give it all back to them. We had to wait about fifteen minutes this time. So we waited and waited and waited. Finally they gave us our food and this time we got the store we ordered. We finally left @ORGANIZATION2 and we got to eat our food. Also we got ice cream after we ate. ""@CAPS1 the good thing is you guys were so patience. Thank you guys for being good!"" is what my mom said to us wen we got home. that is how I was patience."
1074	19023	7	3	(waiting) (healt beatina ) ìGOOD MORNING MS. JOHNSON. HERE is your report cardsî. said Ms.Hemlock. I was the last one in line. ìYOU go MS. JOHNSON, keep up the good work!î said Ms.Hemlock. ìYES!!!!î I said screaming happily I ran home going straitght HOMEî ìHI HONEY MS. JOHNSON.î MY mom aya said . I called MY GRANDMA saying, ìGRANDMA. I DID keep up the good work! but can I order something from the internet for $20?î ìOKAY why not for a GOOD student. I placed MY order and I waited ONE week to receive it. It was worth the wait given my good grades.
1075	19024	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to a skate competition in California. The registration line was almost by the entrance. I stood there for almost an hour, but when I got up there & paid my fee, it was all worth it because I got to compete against my best friends. In the end, the lengthy wait faded in comparison to the fun I had skating with my friends.
1076	19025	7	3	A time when i was patient was at the @NUM1 birthday bash where i used to live. I was waiting in line, and the line was like a mile long, so I waited and waited. Then finally, I go to look for my ticket and forget I left it in the car, so I had to go all the way back to get it. So then I get back, which got twice as big as before, then I wait some more; it sucked. Then, outta nowhere, it starts raining, I didn’t got an umbrella, I’m still waiting. How could it get any worse? Well, it did; they shut down the concert because of the weather. So I went home soaking wet, my feet and hands freezing. So I just lay down, go to sleep, and relax. Despite the day's unfortunate events, I managed to find some peace in resting. P.S. Worst day of my life.
1077	19026	7	3	Me, I have very little patience. I mean nearly none. When I wait I get this weird feeling, almost like a tooth ache. Weird huh? Well you get the picture, let me tell you a story about when I lost my patience. It was the @DATE1, I was at my @CAPS1 safety course put on by the @ORGANIZATION1. We had just finished up taking the test that determined success, or failure in the course. They came out with the first group of peoples' names who passed and their certificates. By the way everyone is outside waiting. The first group was done @NUM1 minutes. It took about @NUM2 minutes to grade the tests and five to give out the awards. Unfortunately my group was last. We all sat on a bench for three hours! My patience completely were off, I just started rocking back and forth back and forth @CAPS2 my group finally got called up and we got our awards! My patience has thankfully gotten a @CAPS3 better since @CAPS2. I did pass the course and am becoming a good @CAPS1. I 've shot is partridge, and one @NUM3 point buck. That is my story, have a good night!  Me, I have very little patience. I mean nearly none. When I wait I get this weird feeling, almost like a tooth ache. Weird huh? Well you get the picture, let me tell you a story about when I lost my patience. It was the @DATE1, I was at my @CAPS1 hunter safety course put on by the @ORGANIZATION1 Department of Fish and Wildlife. We had just finished up taking the test that determined success, or failure in the course. They came out with the first group of peoples' names who passed and their certificates. By the way everyone is outside waiting. The first group was done @NUM1 15 minutes. It took about @NUM2 30 minutes to grade the tests and five to give out the awards. Unfortunately my group was last. We all sat on a bench for three hours! My patience completely wore off, I just started rocking back and forth back and forth FINALLY my group finally got called up and we got our awards! My patience has thankfully gotten a LITTLE better since FINALLY. I did pass the course and am becoming a good HUNTER. I 've shot is partridge, and one @NUM3 8 point buck. That is my story, have a good night! And I hope my patience continues to improve as I gain more experience.
1078	19027	7	3	I have to be patient when I’m taking the TEST EXAM. I’m patient because I have to wait for my classmates to finish their TEST EXAM. I sometimes have to wait forever. But that’s fine I can just take a nap. I sometimes hate being patient. It just frustrates me. Waiting for like 30 minutes just for people to finish a test. It’s good because you shouldn’t rush on the TEST. It just frustrates me that people take so long. It’s not just at school it’s at my house too. The doctor, dentists at a friends house and and at the library. Man this is so hard to be patient. But it’s not good to be in patient. I wish people were as fast is I am during a test. Then I wouldn’t have to be very patient. O well I guess I’m just going to deal with it man this really stinks being so patient, but knowing it's important helps.
1079	19028	7	3	Patience is a good thing to have. Good things come from patience and bad things dont happen. But what is patience? Patience is being able to handle problems without whining and complaining about them. Patience is being able to wait while others can’t. Some people are very impatient, such as my dad at some times. For a month or so he had been saving up his extra money for a new TV. Once he had enough he got a new “42” flat screen TV, but if he had waited only about another week he could’ve gotten one about a foot bigger for the same price. Lets say your little sister is bagging you and you beep nicely asking her to stop but she just won’t. So instead of totally flipping out on her which will get u into tons of trouble just wait for a parent to get home so she gets in trouble and you dont. Therefore, patience, though difficult to practice sometimes, ultimately helps us make better choices and avoid unnecessary conflict.
1080	19029	7	3	Once upon a time there was a girl named Lily. She had always dreamed to be a princess. Every present she got was either a dress or jewelry. She loved to try on dresses. She had two sisters both one year older than Lily, there name were AMY and Sarah. Amy’s house is an old house located in the woods. One day Lily went out to get the mail, and a man with a tuxedo on gave her a letter that looked very fancy. Lily opened the letter and read it aloud, it said “DEAR Lily, your invited to ball at the castle on December 25th at 8 pm.” Lily screamed in exitment. Lily decided to go to the mall to look for a ball gown. She found a beatifulgown but it was to much money. She asked the lady at the front desk if there was any way they could lower the price was I she helped around the store for a couple of days. She accepted the offer. She worked and worked for hours for two days. And fonaly her patients paid off. She could take the dress home. She drove home and put the dress on. She only had an hour so she had to hurry. She put her makeup and jewelry on and looked at her self in the mirror and said I did it. She got in the car and drove to the castle, it was so beautiful the way the moon hit the gold paint. Lily got out of the car and walked inside the castle. She walked down the stairs and every one stared. It was Amy’s best day of her life to have everyone think she was beautiful. She went to the dance floor and danced with some guys. The prince came up to introduce him self and when she turned around he fell in love. Lily couldn’t believe the prince talked to her. He asked her to dance. They danced all night. When the prince went on stage he called her name and she went on stage. He asked her will you marry me, she said yes. She had become a princess! Sometimes dreams really do come true.
1081	19030	7	3	One time when I had to be patient was when I had to babysit. My family friend has a one year old, And I have a six year old brother. I had to babysit both of them because my mom and her boyfriend were going to have a double date with our family friends. Things were great until they left .My brother was in preschool at the time and they gave them these paper books and worksheets to do and I had to help him. I thought ok this will be easy, I had him read the book and my mom told me that he knows the words so I wouldn’t have to sound out every single one. But I had to because he wouldn’t do the work, and the baby wouldn’t quit crying, and the dog wouldn’t stop barking (he hates when babies cry) and the house was crazy! I started to panic. What was I supposed to do? And I didn’t want to ruin my mom's plans and I definitely wanted to prove her wrong. I calmed down and remembered what one of our friends said; he told me to be patient. I let the dog outside and picked up the baby and headed back to the table where my brother was playing. First I read the book aloud; it got both of their attention. Then I told and made a game out of doing the work and it was all good. Then dinner time came. I made some food that we all liked and set the baby in his high chair with his food and gave my brother his plate. I turned around and he threw his plate at me and food was everywhere! I got mad and told myself be patient. I cleaned up the mess and fed the kids and put in a movie and they all fell asleep! I quietly cleaned up the house and my mom and friends walked in and were surprised I did it. Patience is a big part of life; if you lose your temper it just makes things worse, so remaining calm and composed is crucial for navigating difficult situations successfully.
1082	19031	7	3	One day my mom came home from work. She came in and said “Son, do you want to go shopping for your clothes now or later?” I chose later. So my mom changed her clothes and we were off to the store. It was around 5:00 PM so it was rush hour. It seemed like it was taking forever and I was getting mad. Then my mom said be patient and it will be over soon. This is a time when I was patient. After ten minutes, things started to clear up. It still took a while but it was getting better. In less than twenty minutes we were pulling up in the Macy’s parking lot. There was a few cars in the lot but it didn’t seem like much. When we got into the store that’s when I really was mad. The lines for you to purchase your items lead all the way to the back of the store. Then my mom said “Now look. The lines are long as you can see. Are you sure you can handle this and have patients?” “I’ll try”. I said. After we got in the store we were looking for my clothes, we were looking at the long lines also, to see if they went down some. We got my clothes, then got in line. We spent about an hour worth of time in the line and it made me mad. Not only did it make me mad, it made me hungry because I skipped lunch. When we got out of the store, we were happy and hungry. We left the store and went to McDonald's. When we were down the street from McDonald's, there was this traffic line we got closer and closer to McDonald's and then realized that line was the McDonald's line. We got in the lot and I knew for sure that I was going to have more patients. So we waited and the line went really fast. We got up to the speaker and my mom ordered a fish sandwich for her and a chicken sandwich for me. We got to the next window and they gave us our food. When we got our food, the lady said “Thank you for your patients”. Then she asked us would we like a free frie of any size for our wait. We told her yes and we will take a large frie. My mom turn to me and said “Do you see what happens if you be patient?” I said yeah and patients is a good thing to have. That was a time when I was patient.
1083	19032	7	3	The time I was patient, I had trouble with football. I needed help doing everything. But my dad helped me. He taught me how to throw, kick, run, and train. I was patient because I watched them and then I did it. I saw one help my dad playing, and we went out to join them. The stuff he taught me was hard, but it helped, and patience made the learning process much easier.
1084	19033	7	3	Patience is probably one of the most important things in your life. If you are patient, most people will probably like you more, for example, if you are in line for something at school, and you were patient, you will probably get a “thank you” from one of your teachers for being so patient. You always have to be patient, whether or not if it is at school, an amusement park ride’s line in front, and behind a bunch of people, you will want to be patient, because if you are not, you wouldn’t want to lose it in front of all of those people and cut in front of them, and possibly get thrown out of the amusement park in front of all those people, then, you would be embarrassed. This is why I think patience is important.
1085	19034	7	3	"Fishing is a great sport, but it takes a lot of patience. My first fishing trip was at a lake about 50 miles from my home. I had loved fishing ever since then, but the trip wasn't easy. I think that fishing is fun because I was patient; accomplishing what I did took every ounce of patience I had. When my uncle visits from Chicago he always brings his fishing rods and fishes in a different way. I never went with him until about one year ago. He decided that I should bring a friend, so if I got bored, I would have someone to talk to. The patience started when we were about half way there and BANG! We hit a fence. The car had broken down so we called a tow truck. The wait was about 2 hours, 30 min and my friend asked, ""So are we there yet?"" My friend sucked. We finally fixed the car and drove the rest of the way. Once we got there, we had two problems to fix, and we had no bait. We found a nice spot at the other side of the lake. We had to scavenge for some bait, which took about 4 hours for enough bait. We were finally ready to fish. We got the rods, sat the chairs, cast, and waited. There was no way to make fishing faster so we sat, hoping for some bites. In the end my uncle, my friend, and I caught 8 fish! We had eat three for lunch and went home with 5 fish left. I love to go fishing because it relaxes me. I felt like anything could have happened, but we went fishing, relaxed, and brought a couple of meals home. That's why I love fishing because it requires patience."
1086	19035	7	3	One time when I was patient was my birthday I was turning @NUM1. I was very excited because I knew that I was getting a cell phone and that's all I wanted. All of my friends had them I just wanted one because if my mom had to pick me up for something and didn't know where I was, it is just a need right now because they are very helpful. My birthday was on a @DATE1 so the night before I was at the football game everybody was asking if I was going to get one and I kept on telling them yes I'm getting it tomorrow. I woke up the next morning and ran downstairs. The first gift that I got was the cell phone and I was really happy and I started to get all of my friends numbers. I learned when you're patient and not constantly asking, you will get what you want eventually.
1087	19036	7	3	"One day, my brother and I asked my dad to take us to GameStop so we could get a new game controller. He said ""in a little bit,"" so we waited, passing by riding our bikes for about 45 minutes. Then we went swimming in our pool for a while. He still wasn't ready, so we played with my dog, Macy, and then he was finally ready to go. So we went to GameStop to get the controller, and they didn't have it, so we went to Best Buy, and they had it! So we got the controller and went home and played the game on two player mode, and that is how I was patient all day. And the best way to be patient is to keep yourself occupied for a long period, so you don't focus on the waiting."
1088	19037	7	3	My grandma was patient for @NUM1 months because she had a big check that kept having mistakes with it, like they spelled her last name wrong, so it had to be called back and retyped. Every time they retyped it, they would make mistakes five times in a row, and it takes a long time to process. We needed to pay our bills so we wouldn’t get kicked out. We also needed a new car and clothes because our car was ready to break down, and our clothes, we outgrew. When my grandma finally got her check, we went straight out and got a brand new car and clothes. I think my grandma was pretty patient after they had to redo it over five times; I know I wouldn’t be able to be that patient without losing it, and it was impressive that she remained so calm.
1089	19038	7	3	The story is about a time I was patient. I am being patient right now. I am being patient about waiting for @CAPS1. I'm not a person who likes to be patient. When I want something I want it that second. Christmas is my favorite holiday. There is so much good stuff about it. There are cookies, family and presents. There is always a problem and my problem is I like to try and figure out what my present is. That is what stinks about being patient, you are always waiting for something good to happen. All my family knows not to put anything in a bag for me because I will look in the bag easily and if they don't wrap it very good I will find a little slit in the wrapping paper. The worst time to be patient is the night before you can open your presents. I really hate that you have to go to bed and your presents are yelling not to leave them unpackaged. Something also it seems to be all holidays are like that. Well I guess we all have to be patient on something, I'm being patient on @LOCATION1 football winning the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @ORGANIZATION1 and Florida Gators. First @ORGANIZATION1 has got to get out of the @CAPS5 bowl game thing, so it seems patience is needed even when cheering for your favorite teams.
1090	19039	7	3	"Have you ever seen someone lack good patience? Well, I have. My neighbor had just one thing on his mind. He couldn’t wait till the soccer try outs to score. He practiced all day juggling, passing, and moves. The day came for tryouts. He went and juggled, talked with the coach, showed off some moves and went home. ""It will be a couple weeks to see if you are on the team or not,"" the coach said. ""I can’t wait that long,"" he said. After he got back he told me all about it. ""I hate to wait a couple of weeks,"" he said. So I told him about patience. The more you complain, I said, the worse you will dwell on your disappointment. So he went home and practiced a move he couldn’t make. A few days later, I was walking outside when suddenly, ""I made it!"" My neighbor came screaming outside saying, ""I made it!"" I just smiled as I said, ""Patience works."" Patience truly helped him achieve his goal."
1091	19041	7	3	"One time that I was patient was when I was 8 years old when I caught my first fish. Me and my dad went fishing on my uncle's boat. My dad stopped the boat where we were going to fish. My dad helped me put on my life jacket and then he baited my pole and then casted it out for me. My dad was catching them like crazy, in like the first hour he got about five fish. He told me to be ""patient,"" that it was my first time. So as my dad was reeling them in, I was sitting there waiting, and then all of a sudden my bobber went down. I yelled out to my dad; he said, ""Reel it in!"" I tried and tried and almost fell off the boat. My dad came over and helped me. When we got it on the boat, I asked my dad what kind of fish it was. He said it was a blue gill. He said it was a good catch for a first-timer, so me and my dad released it and went back to fishing. That was a time where I had to be patient."
1092	19042	7	3	At my old school before this school, I was patient all the time. In some instances, there were people trying to jump others. I told them to leave. Then, they wanted to fight me, so I was holding onto my patience while the teachers were talking to them about it. Later, I saw them outside, but they did not do anything to me. How I know they were trying to make the school a better place to be is that they did not cause any trouble.
1093	19044	7	3	Patience, everyone knows what it is, and how we all can stay focused is like if we're waiting in an unemployment line. We wait because patience keeps us from getting angry, but if we're waiting for a long time, there's a better chance of getting angry. When you wait, you also show care, acknowledging someone is ahead of you. You wait, wait, wait until it's your turn because waiting and being patient lets you absorb the things around you and look at things you've never seen before in your whole life. You study what you saw to see what it is, even if you already know it. When you're patient, you show gratitude to the person in front of you, and gratitude shows respect and trustworthiness; that's a way of being polite and patient to the person in front of you. When you're patient, you don't have to rush anything because you have a lot of time, and you shouldn't complain at all when you are or are trying to be patient, no matter how long your patience lasts. The maximum time is for you, and you bring up that time faster by not being patient. Patience is a big thing because patience gives you what you want or need in a lot of time; I think patience is important because you never know who's patient with you, so you should be patient with someone else, showing that you appreciate their consideration as well.
1094	19046	7	3	"The first time I ever was patient before is when I had to wait @DATE1 years to get @DATE1 film out of my camera. My mom always promises me to get the film, but since her money was used on necessities, she told me to wait @DATE1 @DATE1. So I waited; @DATE1 @DATE1 have come up, and this is what happened. I asked my mom again, ""Can I get my film out of my camera?"" She said no because she used her money on school supplies. I happened to wait another @DATE1 @DATE1, so @DATE1 @DATE1 came again. I asked her, and she said no because once again, she spent her money on paying people back for them helping her out, like any dad. So I had to wait until next @NUM1 @DATE1. So I waited, and waited, and finally, @NUM1 @DATE1 has passed, and she forgets, so she had to get groceries. So @DATE1 I asked her one more time, and she said yes, but she had to pay my dad back for helping her. After that, she said, ""After school, I am bringing my film out to buy."" So, I have now told you how I have waited to do that and also had to get a new digital camera because it has been dropped too many times, highlighting how long I had to wait and the eventual need for replacement due to damage."
1095	19047	7	3	Every day at launch I have to be patient while waiting to get called up to get my lunch. Especialy when your waiting in line, then you really have to be patient. But sometimes your lucky and you can go to the other line to pay for lunch. And then when you finish lunch you can go out ride and play. But you must finish your food and throw it away and wait patienty. And thats a time when I was patient. It's hard waiting, but worth it to play outside. So being patient at lunch has its rewards.
1096	19048	7	3	I was patient in a plane ride going to New York. All I did was stare at towers and buildings as I passed them. I was also patient when my little brother got a flu shot and I had to wait in the lobby. The biggest time I’ve ever been patient was with my brother and him going through my things, breaking all my stuff, biting me with his toys, and his constant whining or crying over stuff that he wants. Indeed, practicing patience with him has been a continuous learning experience.
1097	19049	7	3	During the @DATE1 my family and I went to @LOCATION3 for a couple weeks. In the beginning of the second week I did something i have never done before. My two older sisters (@LOCATION1 and @PERSON1), dad,cousin (@PERSON2), @PERSON2ís uncle (@CAPS1) and I were on our way to the boat. I was excited, this was my first time fishing in a ocean. A few hours past and we didnít catch anything,but we still waited while drinking coffe, telling jokes, doing little pranks like pulling each others line to make them think we caught something. We left at @NUM1 am and now it was @NUM2 pm. We still didnt catch anything but dad and @CAPS1 go fishing all the time and said we just had to be patient. About @NUM3 minutes later @CAPS3 line started pulling @CAPS1 helps her reach it in, it was a clam the size of my thumb. Everyone was so patient but no one caught anything else. Now it was @NUM4 pm and we decided to go home. @PERSON2 was happy. Everyone was just being patient and waiting to catch something but @PERSON2 was also very patient because she had to use the bathroom for most of the time we were on the boat. I think most of us on the boat had to secretly use the bathroom after being there for so many hours. When we got home we told evryone what we caught,which was nothing for everyone besides for @PERSON3 and her tiny clam. I know lots of people who wouldnt last on that boat for an hour. So i was proud of how patient everyone was and i hope to do it again next time i go to @LOCATION2 with my family, because even with no fish caught, the experience and the company made it worthwhile.
1098	19050	7	3	Being patient is not an easy thing to maintain. It takes self control in order to have patience. Having patience is very important because if you have a goal and you're not patient, you might not wait your turn. People are not going to hire you, they are not looking for an impatient person. First, my family and I were going on a trip to Orlando but we had to leave at 4:00 am so I couldn’t go to sleep. I woke up at 1:00 am so I was tired. I couldn’t take a nap because if I did the nap will turn into a deep sleep. Next I had to finish packing clothes so I was really tired and that's how I was ran because it was a hour left. When I was done packing, I started to watch t.v to keep me awake because I can’t go to sleep under a television. Then my cousin had to have his diper changed so I was to change it, but right when I was about to get comfortable my mom called and said ìletís go.î I was happy because now I get to go to sleep in the rental van. In conclusion, I had to maintain my patience, but it was really hard to do when your really sleepy. I tried different things to keep me awake and it worked. What really was about to make me angry was that I had to change a diper but some how I maintained my patience, and it proved beneficial in the long run.
1099	19051	7	3	"One beautiful day in July, my sister and I were outside. My mom said that she'd be right back. She's going to the store, a couple hours later she is home back with a hot. She said the gift was for my sister but she said couldn't don't open the gift till her birthday. Her birthday was in a couple of weeks. She said she couldn't wait that long and stormed off. After a couple of days, she decided to be patient. She thought days would go by radius. They did to her stick, but not fast enough. My mom told her body to be waited of just target about the boy. The gift is hard for her to ignore in her house she is home. I was going to laugh. I had decided to help her. We got ice cream and said on the way home. Finally, the gift's birthday was here and she was screed lad. She had opened all of her gifts excepted one. The hot was sitting want I her. She dosed over to and ripped the gift. One When she opened the gift .She just stared. In the break of silence, she said."" The gift's just clothes"". I could tell she didn't like the gift."" I can't have that I was patient for so long for clothes."" I bursted out in laughter. I thought the gift was bananas. After I stoped laughing for told me don't get used to the being patient house you might never be again, which made me realize that patience, while difficult, can sometimes lead to anticlimactic results."
1100	19052	7	3	CAN'T control yourself? You ask your parents, “when” and they say, “soon just have some patience!” Well this has happened to me multiple times, such as when we were going to Disneyland or Disneyworld, but on this special occasion, getting our new dog. I decided to be a mature teenager and be patient. It was December 12th, 2015 at 3:00PM, the day my family was getting a dog and I was so excited. My stomach was filled with butterflies, trying to fly out and explode in happiness. Everyone else in my family was the same way, but just then, I remembered my goal about being a mature teenager and patient. So I carried on with my normal, everyday life. Eat breakfast, comb hair, get dressed, brush teeth, and go to school. Later, when I came home, my mom announced that my dad will arrive with my puppy in 30 minutes. So I sat on my chair, in my room and watched the clock tic and toc for about 20 minutes. Then, I walked in to the living room, where the rest of my family was sitting and waited till I heard a door slam. Suddenly. Boom! The door slammed on my dads truck. My mom, brother, and sister bolted to the door as I simply walked to see the puppy. “aww!” everyone screamed. “LET me hold her,” and “she’s my dog,” and “let’s name her” also came in the conversation. Then, my dad glared at me, standing their quietly and handled me the dog. “you are being so patient, you CAN be the one to hold her first!” I was so proud of myself. I was patient and I was the one that got to hold her first. Being patient DOES pay off!
1101	19054	7	3	I was patient when I was at my friendís house in the winter shoveling a sledding spot so we could put water on it to make ice. When we were shoveling, it was hard because we had to get through lots of snow just to get to a nice layer of snow to put lots of water on it. I am not a patient guy when we do something for hours to get it fully done, but I kept telling myself to just be patient. The only reason I was losing my patience was because it was getting dark and I had to go soon. But before I became impatient, we got it done, and I was so happy we got the icy trail done. It was tough because we also had to wait for the water to turn into ice, but that didn't bother me at all. That's how I was patient that day to get a great and fun thing done. But we couldn't go on it that night because it was too late. That's my story about patience, and it shows how focusing on the reward helped me stay calm.
1102	19055	7	3	Patience is an important part of life and I learned that November 2022 during hunting season. Most of November 2022 we sat and saw everything but deer. We were getting to the point where we didn’t want to go anymore but we did anyways. As the days went by as it got colder we started to see some does. My step dad John said we will shoot one on the 25th if we don't see bucks. After a few days it was the 25th and we were going to shoot a doe but we didn't see anything most of the 25th. When there was about 10 minutes left of 25th light the perfect buck walked into the field, showing that patience can indeed pay off in unexpected ways.
1103	19056	7	3	One day me my mom and my brother were driving in our car. We were going to a beach when suddenly our car wouldn't move. The battery had been run down and didn't work. My mom called a tow truck and said he wouldn't be here for two hours! Me and my brother complained all the time but my mom just sat quiet, so when the truck finally got to us, we loaded the car with some difficulty. I was amazed by my mom's patience.
1104	19057	7	3	One time I was on my way to the bus stop, and I had got their @NUM1 minutes before the bus came so I sat their and I looked at my watch it was @NUM2 minutes past the time I was support to get picked up so I waited and waited so I looked at my watch again it was @NUM3 minutes pass the time I was support to be on the bus. So I was growing in nation but I had thought well buses are??? late sometimes, I sat back down and I wanted because I really was going to make it to school and I grew very patient and after @NUM4 more minutes the bus had came, and it had let me on free because I was the only person who stayed at the stop? So when I got back home my mom asked me how did it go I said the bus was late @NUM5 minutes she said what did you do I said I waited and they let me on free she said that is what you get for being patient, which was a good lesson to learn.
1105	19058	7	3	I was waiting in line at @LOCATION1 adventure for a ride. I was becoming impatient just waiting there. But suddenly I saw the line move. So then I calmed down and waited, when it was our turn to ride. I just realized it was an hour we had been waiting. Understanding impatience means you know why you have to stand there waiting, because you can't push or shove your way to the front of the line. Tolerance means you can't do or get whatever you want unless you trouble others. You can't hit, cut, push, or shove to the front of the line; you just have to wait your turn, which is ultimately a fairer and more respectful approach for everyone involved.
1106	19059	7	3	"Being patient requires a lot of tolerance. For most people it's hard to be patient but sometimes it's very important. A few weeks ago my neighbor really needed a break from her 2 year old daughter, Lily. I gladly offered to babysit because I love being with her. I definitely didn't know what I was in for. She came over at around noon and we played for hours. But then she got cranky. I gave her a snack but that didn't help. She started crying and I had no idea what to do. My mom came rushing in the room in panic mode. ""What's going on? Is everything ok in here?"" she asked. I told her that everything's fine but Lily is just really cranky. My mom replied ""let's take her to the park she will have fun there!"" I agreed and off we went. I noticed Lily likes to do things herself. She insisted on getting in her car seat done, getting on the swings and putting together puzzles. That requires a ton of patience because she takes forever. I love watching Lily but if I didn't have patient it would be extremely difficult. Therefore, patience is essential when caring for young children."
1107	19060	7	3	It takes patience when you are out hunting. After about three deer seasons my patience paid off. I was using a bow and an eight point walked out. He was about 40 yards from my stand and I called him closer. Then he was 20 yards from my stand. I took the shot and he buckled and the 30 minutes I waited to find him felt like a lifetime. Then I got out of my stand; he ran about 60 yards and dropped. When I got to him, I was so excited because he wasn't an eight point; he was a ten point buck. Do remember, use the Rage broad head and be patient; you could shoot the deer of a lifetime.
1108	19061	7	3	This is a story about patience. Patience is needed in life. Sometimes when you get very frustrated, you need patience. One reason is if someone or something gets you mad, you need patience or you can get in trouble. For example if you get mad because of someone and you start a fight, you’ll get in huge trouble with the law and possibly hurt someone. Or if you try doing something and you can’t, you need patience or you can break something and get in trouble with your parents or others. Another reason for patience is if you are working with someone or teaching someone, you need patience so you don’t hurt their feelings if they can’t do something right, such as a new skill. They might get mad and not want to be with you or learn from you. A third reason for patience is if you know someone who keeps getting you mad or keeps humiliating you, you need to have patience with him/her. Just ignore the person so you both don’t get in trouble at school or work. If you wouldn’t have patience, things could end drastically, with broken relationships or worse. So that is why you should have patience. Without patience you can get in trouble, lose a friend, and a lot of other things could go wrong, making life difficult. That’s why you need patience to navigate challenges and maintain positive relationships.
1109	19062	7	3	I have a lot of patience. For example, I really wanted to know if I made the volleyball team, but I had patience and did not complain. I believe having patience is very respectful toward yourself and others. Once I had a test and really wanted to know when we were going to receive it, but I had patience. Others did not have patience; both were complaining because they did not have patience. Another example is when we were going to go to the beach on Sunday, and though we still hadn't planned the day, I tried to be patient. I did not have a ruler here that time, and it made it worse; losing patience and thinking about it only made it worse. Men sometimes are more patient and sometimes not so much. Maintaining patience, even when circumstances are challenging, can lead to more positive outcomes.
1110	19063	7	3	I woke up at around @NUM1 am not feeling very good. I was at my friend @CAPS1's house. I tried to wait it out until he woke up, but I just couldn’t wait so I woke her up. I told her I wanted to go home so I called my mom, and in about @NUM2 minutes my mom had come to pick me up. I told her that I thought I was getting sick. I had to wait and wait until finally we got home; it took about two hours until I threw up. It was horrible, making for a very unpleasant morning.
1111	19064	7	3	My mom have patience with me and my brother with all the fighting going on. People getting killed around here; she don’t like us going places with that going on. We come home late, and she worries a lot about our safety given the circumstances. It’s hard on her, but she still tries to understand us.
1112	19065	7	3	There was a time that I didn’t want to be patient but had to be. We as a family were going to go to @PERSON2's cabin for a holiday. On the way, while we were on the highway, about @NUM1 yards ahead of us, two cars were nurcharged and both pulled over. They were beside the median with anger. Soon after that the cops came. Keep in mind that we were waiting behind all this. The cops investigated everything and called in something. @NUM2 minutes later a truck came around the traffic jam and started fixing the road. I don’t know why there was nothing to be fixed. Finally, around an hour later we were let past, and continued our ride to @PERSON1's house. The delay was frustrating, but we eventually made it to our destination.
1113	19068	7	3	Lots of people are good at being patient Iím not so good at it. But when your traveling along distance, you have to learn how to be patient. Several times a year, my mom, my sister, sometimes my dad, and I drive up to my grandmaís house. She lives about 8 hours away, near Canada. My grandma loves when family visits, so we donít mind taking one weekend every few months to go and see her. Iíve had to have been there at least 20 times in my life time. My mom works the night shift at a well known hardware store. Usually, she works 10 PM to 6 AM. So when she gets off work we would pack up and leave. I always bring my phone with me to keep me entertained. But most of the time I sleep. One time, I had drunk lots of pop and was very hyper. I was annoying my mom a lot. So, I put in my phone with me to keep me entertained. But most of the time I sleep. One time, I had drunk lots of pop and was very hyper. I was annoying my mom a lot. So, I put in my phone and started acting like an idiot, singing along to the songs. Until, my phone died. I felt my heart break a little. I couldnít fall asleep now. I was still hyper. I started listening to the radio, but all we could listen to was country. Since, we were going north, we were traveling away from the control tower of the cool radio stations. Finally, we reached, ìThe up north storeî where we always stop to get gas and food when we go to grandmaís. I got snacks and even more pop. I gave a tiny evil laugh to myself as I handed the items to my mom. In the car, I finished my food and was bored once again. There was nothing to do in that car. I was angry at that point. I looked out the window and sighed. Soon enough, I had fallen asleep. I woke up to the sound of us pulling into the drive way, and my grandma running to come greet us. Finally, we were there. I had survived yet another, ride to grandmaís house. Then I remembered, we had to drive home too. Even though I make this trip several times a year, Iím almost positive will never stop getting bored during the ride, and I suppose that's something I'll have to come to terms with eventually. Being patient, is not one of my favorite things to do.
1114	19069	7	3	I want to go see a movie. There are no movies here at home I want to see. “Dad, can I go to the movies with someone?” I asked. “Sure!” Dad answered. I looked up what movies were in and there was a pretty good selection. I pick the movie I wanted to see. Then I realize I need someone to go with me. I called up my friend Sarah and asked her if she wanted to go see the movie I wanted to see. Ended up she wanted to see it too so, she said yes. After that I got something to eat and relaxed. All of a sudden, it time to leave. I was running behind. I ready really quickly and went and picked up Sarah. Unlike me she was calm and patient. In her place I wouldn’t have been. That’s one of the reason why I like Sarah as a friend. I was so glad she was willing to go with me to the show.
1115	19070	7	3	Do you have patients? I am very patient. I will wait for anything for long. Where you have patience, you have to wait on what you wait for, or need.
1116	19071	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to the glasses place, and I had to get approved to get glasses. So the next day my grandma called and asked did @PERSON1 get approved, and they said “@CAPS1.” My grandma asked how long do I have to wait, and they said four weeks. So a week went by, and they called and said my glasses were done. So the next day we went and got them, and that was a time I was patient because I waited even though it was shorter than expected.
1117	19072	7	3	“Ugh!” I fell on my butt, again. I was trying to throw a front-full for cheer. A front-full is a big twisty thing in the air. I almost had it, I just couldn’t land it. My gymnastics coach has been very patient with me, he has been working with me for about a month, on this one trick. I wanted to make him proud, he is like a brother to me. His name is Mr. Thompson, I have known him since third grade. Whenever he sees me he says “my baby!” and gives me a hug and kiss on the forehead. Mr. Thompson can do many amazing things, he has competed many times. He taught me my back handspring, the first trick I had. His patience helps me, but sometimes it doesn’t. I am happy he is patient but sometimes he is too patient. Sometimes I would rather have him push me harder. Whenever I think he gets disappointed in me, I feel really bad. I always give it my all when I feel like that. It is an amazing feeling when you get it for him. “Ugh!” I fell on my but, again. Instead of the normal, enthusiastic “try again”, it was flat and bored. I went to the edge of the floor. My adrenaline was pulsing. I was going to get this! As I ran and jumped everything was good. I did the trick, and landed! For about a second anyway. My feet slipped and from under me, Mr. Thompson came running to me smiling. He was proud of me, even though I didn’t stick it perfectly. We kept working and eventually I got it right! I was really happy to tell my cheer coach, but even happier that I did it for Mr. Thompson, and that made all the falls worth it.
1118	19073	7	3	Last summer my mom ordered a PS5 and I was patient for an entire summer. One summer, few months and four months and five months to be exsact. Why? Well, the game came out this summer, on August 15th and I had to wait for. How did I pass the time? Simple, don’t think about the game, try not to talk about the game and only write when it comes out on daily calenders. Even though I beat the game exactly thirty two times on every difficulty without any help. (heh,heh!) I still have to wait for another month or so for callop duty: Modern Warfare 3. So this, ah, stinks because now I can’t stop thinking about it. It seems like the waiting is the hardest part.
1119	19076	7	3	Everyone should have patience. Living with patience will help you because you are going to have to be patient sometimes. Sometimes some people can be patient, and some can't be patient, and which I am one of these people. Quite some time I can be patient, and sometimes can't be patient. Being patient was a hard thing for me to overcome. Well, I didn't! But for once I was patient in my life. That time was when a lot of elderly people were coming through the door, and I finally held the door for all of them. It wasn't easy because I had to be at a DOCTOR appointment in about 10 min, and there were a lot of them. It took about almost 2 min to wait for all of them to get through the door. But I still continued holding the door, and after holding the door I was late for my DENTAL appointment, but it was still okay if I was coming. Although it was difficult, that moment made me realize the value and reward of exercising patience.
1120	19077	7	3	One time I was patient was last year when I was at an amusement park in Ohio called Cedar Point. I was standing in line to get on an amazing roller coaster called the Millennium Force. It was a very tough ride and delightfully thrilling in the air, but the wait was ten hours long. Standing in the hot, unbearable line hurt, was horrid, and usually when in situations like that, I lose my cool.
1121	19078	7	3	When I went to get my new phone I had to be patient because my grandma likes to work with a spacific person. The man named @CAPS1 who my grandma and me were waiting for finally came to us so we went to the phase I wanted and he talking for long time, but my grandma said if I wasnít patient I wouldnít get my new phone that day. We make it up to the counter and heís showing thing about the phone, I want to get out of there so I could look at it myself. Me and my grandma finally leave and I have my new phone with and I like it. One time I had to be patient was when I was learning to drive; waiting for the right moment to merge onto the highway felt like forever, but being patient prevented accidents and helped me become a safer driver. Me and my grandma finally leave and I have my new phone with and I like it.
1122	19079	7	3	A time when I was patient was at the doctors. The doctor took too long, and I was patient for the doctor to come back to the room. It was @DATE1 at @TIME1, and my mom and I went to the doctors because I had an appointment. I got there, and the doctor called me and took me to a room, and like @NUM1 minutes later, he came back. All of that time we were waiting, me and my mom were talking about things. I wondered what was taking so long, and my mom said she didn’t know but to just wait. Then the doctor came and started asking me questions, like what I eat, and what I do for exercise, and I said I didn’t know. Then after they finished asking the questions, they said sorry for keeping us waiting and gave my mom some papers. Then we went downstairs, and I had to go to a lab to take my blood. There were a lot of people, and I was patient. Then they called me down and took my blood; that was a time when I was patient with my mom at the doctors.
1123	19080	7	3	Iím patient and Iím in the middle; patience is all about waiting or juss sitting with someone you donít like. One time when I was little I was not very patient. My mom wants say had on a couple of seconds and I would say 2. But when I got older I was more patient. Like, I was patient with teachers and peers and parents but there are times that I still have a unpatient side, I will try not to get unpatient but sometimes it juss happens. I love having someone to talk to but some times I canít talk to them because Iím unpatient. My friends are really good about it first though some time they donít; my mom is really patient but my dad is not so maybe get it from him. I donít really talk to my dad though; although Iím unpatient Iím really out going and funny. I have a lot of friends because Iím outgoing; sometimes I get in trouble because Iím outgoing and that has a blown side. I love talking and having fun; maybe if I was more patient it would be more fun. I working on my patience. I think I can do much better than what I have been doing and maybe if I get more patient I will get better in school but I know I will try my hardest in the patience defortment. In conclusion I need more patience but patiuence is a thing I can defiatly work on.
1124	19081	7	3	Patience. Wow, you want criticism; are you sure? Well since you asked for it, it looks like I'm going to have to give it to you. Patience is what my cousins, uncles, aunties and even you and I need in these days and times. We about need it every day. What does the key word patience mean? Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. Also it means you experience difficulties without complaining. Or in my own words, long suffering and also are able to wait until what you want is done. Being patient is something that I am not all the time but, need to be. Like my daddy say to me all the time you are not going to always get or receive everything you want to so you'll have to learn patience. That is one word I do not like when its something I really want. So that is my story about patience explained my way, highlighting the challenges and the necessity of cultivating this virtue.
1125	19082	7	3	A time I have to have patience some times is in class I have to have patience. I don’t have a lot of patience. I have to have patience in math class. Math class is rough. We as the students have a teacher. Mr. Smith talks all the time. He talks till lunch which is about for a half an hour. So I have to wait for a while till he gives us work. That how I have patience. To conclude that when I have to have patience in class, it is during math. Though I don’t have a lot of patience at all, but in class I do.
1126	19083	7	3	"ì@CAPS1 were gonna be late!î yelled my baby cousin @PERSON1 from across the room. She had her big, blue snowcoat and cute red boots on. She began to jump around and it made me laugh easily. ì@CAPS1 were gonna be late!î yelled my baby cousin @PERSON1 from across the room. She had her big, blue snowcoat and cute red boots on. She began to jump around and it made me laugh easily. You see, I was going on a skiing trip with my parents, my cousin @PERSON1, and her parents. I was ecstatic. My parents were spending a lot of time talking to @PERSON1ís parents before we left, so @PERSON1 was a little whiny about not going right away. I tried to distract her. ì@PERSON1, do you want to play @CAPS3? I asked softly, tapping her shoulder. When I said that, her eyes seemed to grow twice their size. ì@CAPS4! @CAPS4! @CAPS4! Madison yeah! I wanna play, I wanna play!î @PERSON1 yelled excitedly, though she made it sound like ""Madishun"". I smiled and we began to play. She would guess and I would let her win. She was so happy and I think I made her more patient to leave by helping her play a game. Finally my parents walked outside and we began our ski trip. Patience had paid off."
1127	19084	7	3	One time I was patient when my little brother was taking a shower and I had to go to the bathroom really badly. So I waited outside the door and of course he locked it. Impatiently, I tried to pick the lock with a toothpick, but it didn’t work at all. Then I told my dad about the situation, and he just laughed and said “be a man, you can hold it in!” so that didn’t work either to solve my problem. I was so desperate at that point I was just about to take the door off the hinges when he finally walked right out and smiled innocently at me. So then I rushed into the bathroom, but it was soaked in water, with puddles everywhere. That’s when I was patient, or at least tried to be, as I yelled at him for making such a mess.
1128	19085	7	3	I’m always having to be patient. It’s because I have an older brother that doesn’t do what he is told. Let’s say my dad tells him to clean the bathroom, well it takes him ten minutes to get up, then I have to go when he’s cleaning and he won’t let me. So that’s one of the reasons. Another is my older sister; she’s always on the phone so I barely ever get to use it. I wait until my parents get home so they yell at her to get off, which is why I am very patient. It's frustrating, and I often wish things could be different, but waiting is just part of my daily life. Therefore, my siblings are teaching me patience, even if they don't mean to.
1129	19086	7	3	It was @DATE1 and I could see the snow pouring down as I drank hot chocolate. I saw our @DATE1 tree is was full of presents, I couldnít wait till I could open them. Iíve been wanting a wii since @DATE1 but I never got one. But that didnít stop me from hoping. So I wish I got one this year. After a while my parents said @CAPS2 can open our gifts. ì@CAPS1î I screamed, I quickly tore the paper off the presents and saw that I got a makeup set, a digital camera, and many more. But not a wii. I was frustrated. So I asked my mom if @CAPS2 could buy the wii tomorrow. But she replied ì@CAPS2 canít afford it. @CAPS2 will buy it when @CAPS2 get enough money. Well I was very patient so I guess I could wait. As @CAPS2 all enjoyed our @DATE1 @CAPS2 watched tv. Then after a week or so my parents got their paycheck, so my mom said @CAPS2 could go out and buy the wii. ì@CAPS3î thank you ìmomî I screamed. When @CAPS2 arrived at the store, I got the wii and it cost @MONEY1. I couldnít believe it, my patient finally paid off. Now I got my new wii, and @CAPS4 enjoying every second of it.
1130	19087	7	3	A lot of people in the world are patient. However I think that my Grandma is the most patient person in the world. I think this because she was born in the dimension she had to be patient for food, money, and water. She couldnít just go out and buy food at the grocer store. She had to be patient to go and make her own food. If she wanted popcorn she would get some corn shells then put them into a pan then start a fire and who knows how long that could take. Then finally wait for the shells to pop. That is war hinder then putting a bag in the mircowave and pushing a button. That is how she is also fooled with technology even with me. That is why I think she is the most patient person in the world.
1131	19089	7	3	Being patient is one of the many important things in life that we have to deal with; if you are impatient, then people will say that you are impatient and need to calm down. Being patient also means that you are a polite person and that you will not complain about anything; whatever happens, you will be understanding and wait. Let's say somebody is in line to get food; you would have to wait your turn to get your food while the other person is getting theirs. That is being an understanding and polite person, sometimes even a role model for little children/kids because you are setting an example and being considerate of others around you. Therefore, being patient takes understanding and consideration, ultimately showcasing respect and empathy.
1132	19090	7	3	Me and my brother have been asking for a dog for a while, every month mom and dad said were going to get one every month ve dog @CAPS1 a fish. Mom would look online for dogs and dad would look online for dogs and dad would look trought the paper. Colin and I told them dayliey well feed it walk it give it water the month of my birthday like @NUM1 days befor the @NUM2 they said that we were getting a dog! tommorrow!

We named her vary patient. and our patiens wore of it was well worthit.  Me and my brother, Colin, have been asking for a dog for a while. Every month mom and dad said were going to get one, every month we'd dog @CAPS1 a fish. Mom would look online for dogs and dad would look online for dogs and dad would look through the paper. Colin and I told them daily we'll feed it, walk it, give it water. The month of my birthday, like @NUM1 days before the @NUM2, they said that we were getting a dog tomorrow! It was at @NUM1:00 at night so we couldn't fall asleep because we were so happy! The @CAPS2 morning around @NUM4 we got in the car. Mom said the place was in Howell so it couldn't be that far. Colin and I were so happy. We got to the house and there were @NUM5 dogs, small fluffy dogs, one white @NUM6 black. I told my mom I wanted her. @CAPS3 told me it was up to dad. Dad loved her so that means @CAPS4. We named her Vary. Patient and our patience wore off, but it was well worth it, because having Vary was such a joy.
1133	19091	7	3	A warrior named @PERSON1 was waiting patiently for his sword, he was waiting for an hour. He just sat quietly while every one was yelling. He was happy. All he could think of was his @CAPS1. He loved swords so much. He had @NUM1 as swords. So he was patiently waiting to get his sword. Then he battled ninjas. He went after the ninjas because they took a boy named @PERSON2. Then he turned them to dust. The sword was made of magic. Then the warrior and @PERSON2 went to school. The warrior was the teacher and @PERSON2 was the student. It was a happy ending.
1134	19092	7	3	My story of when I was patient was when me and my family were going to the Monster Jam. It was one of the most exciting things of my life. But the trip there was almost a disaster! then it took half an hour to find a place to park. Then at least fifteen minutes for my mom's friends to show up. And finally, an hour in line. Last but not least, ten minutes to find our seats! Thank you for listening to my report about patience and sitting through it!
1135	19093	7	3	"There was a time when I really wanted to go somewhere, and my mom said “no, not tonight,” because it was a school night. So I said “okay I know it’s a school night,” but at least I said it with manners and loyalty! That's a time when I was loyal to someone. Here is a time when I stuck up for someone: my best friend was in a fight with this other girl, and it was in person. I went right up to my friend's ""enemy"" and said why don’t you just go home and leave my friend alone. She backtalked me, then finally, we started ignoring her, then she left; that’s a time when I stuck up for my best friend while she was in a fight, showcasing that loyalty can manifest in different ways."
1136	19094	7	3	When I had to go to the doctor, I had thought that I would be in front. There were over @NUM1 twenty people there in line when we got there, and more people were still coming. I had to get my shots, so we had to wait patiently. But my mom could not wait because there were so many people there in front of us. So I fell asleep. She was still walking around. So when I woke up, five people had already gone by. She still could not be patient, still walking around making me nervous; then another @NUM2 three went by—it was going really, really slow. Then she finally cooled down. She was so patient because they said they were going to put her out if she continued. I have never seen her so patient; it was unbelievable how calm she became.
1137	19095	7	3	When I was in the sub line and in @NUM1 grade I waited patiently. If you cut infront of me, I would not care. Than when I waited for @NUM2 minutes and the line was still big. My patience meter went down after @NUM3 minutes I finally got to get a sub. I waited @NUM4 minutes for a sub that is like waiting to get pizza. Once I got to the check-out center I had no money in my account, so I was really angry, angry as in you not being paid any money for a year. I just walked away, not wanting to deal with the embarrassment or the hunger any longer, feeling defeated.
1138	19096	7	3	One time I was patient was when my brother broke his arm. It was a fine day and I was playing outside on the playground during lunch recess. He said that he was on the monkey bars. His hands got all sweaty, and he slipped. Eric fell on his arm. He screamed. The recess ladies brought him to the office and called my parents. Then my parents called my school to tell them they were picking me up. They picked me up and then got my brother. We drove to the hospital, and they did x-rays. It took forever. I sat there quietly for two hours! My parents told me that they appreciated how patient I was. That was the time I was patient.
1139	19097	7	3	My story in my own way about being patient is when there are like @NUM1 people in front of a line at a center point. You have to be patient in the lines because others were before you, so you have to wait your turn in line before you go, because that's called cutting. You will get kicked out of places if you do that; you don't want that to happen. Like, say that you want something to eat, you have to wait your turn in line so you don't get kicked out of the rides; you have to wait your turn so you don't get the security on you. Therefore, being patient ensures you get what you need without negative consequences.
1140	19098	7	3	A time when I was patient was fishing with my grandpa up north and we were siting out there all day and we had to have trolled up and down the chanel at least 6 times. And each time we got bites but we never caught any fish. We tried our usal routine but that wasnít working out so well, so I decided to change it up a bit. I gave my grandpa the idea of turning the boat around and heading towda shigle bay. He agred but the only problem was there were a lot of rocks were we were going and thats the last thing we need is for the prop to get broken off. But we took our chances and modered or we to were were were I direted him to go and as soon as we enter the bag bam! We see the pale bend down so far it was hard to believe it was a fish so I got the net and my grandpa grabed the pole and started to real we evently go it to the surface and it was a 28î wallege we smiled and said looks like were having fish to night, this is the story of when my patients were being tested by fish and then I caught the biggest one in the lake!

1142	19100	7	3	One day in the beginning of foll, @PERSON1 was watching @CAPS1.V. As she was watching, a commercial comes on and says that the final movie, of a very popular series, is coming to theaters tomorrow night. The next day of school, everyone was excited. They all couldn't wait to see the movie that night. Finally the time come to go get the tickets. When @PERSON1 got there, a huge line was already formed. @PERSON1 was waiting, then she realized her best friend, @PERSON2, was in front of her. Then the rich popular girl showed up her lime. Her name was @CAPS2. She walked up to the ticket booth and cut everyone in line. She tried to pay extra money for a better seat and because she cut people in line. The ticket seller said that she would just have to get in line like everybody else. That made @CAPS2 mad, and because she didn't get in line when she got there, more people got in line. But all that time @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were talking. Since they were patient, time flew by and the next thing they knew they were buying tickets. But @CAPS2 thought it took forever to get her tickets cause she was not patient, proving that patience truly is a virtue.
1143	19101	7	3	I was patient when I went to Cedar Point. I had to wait in line a long time for rides since there were a lot of people at Cedar Point. The longest wait was for Dragster. I had almost an hour wait for a ride that lasted only a teen minute, but that is the experience.
1144	19102	7	3	One day my family and I all went to Six Flags. I was so excited. When we arrived I rushed out the car. We got our ticket and a map then we decided what ride we wanted to go on. We were gonna go on the Iron dragon, there was such a long line. It felt like it wasn't even moving. I was as patient as can be. I was so excited to try this ride, the family finally moved up bup bup finally!!! We were next. We all got in our seats and made sure we were buckled in nice and tight. The roller coaster was about a couple minutes long it was worth the wait. That was the time I was patient.
1145	19103	7	3	One day on August 12th at 6:30 I was at the locked Dairy creem store frastyís The line was huge. There had to be over 30 people there and I was in the back of the line siting there waiting. Thinking what I am going to get. One by one they took the orders. Until one short old lady hadnít decided what she was going to get yet I sat and waited as she blaberd on ashing the prices if it was suger free, what toppings it had on it, and so on, and so on, and so on. Finaly she orderd. I am at the front of the line and all of a sudden a group of people come up. I guess they were ìholding there place in lineî. There had to be 6 of them yelling at the person behind the glass dire a roches ship going off. Finaly the order was done and I was up before I could talk this sweet old lady asked ìcan I cut in front of you deer?î I had to say yes it wouldnít be nice if I didít. that is my story about Being patient.
1146	19104	7	3	My brother matt has never been the patient type of guy. He always gets very frustrated whenever something or someone takes too long. We always have to have patience with matt but that all changed one day. Me, my mom, my nephew, matt and his girlfriend decided to go get something to eat. While we were there and waiting in line, I made a bet with matt's girlfriend. The bet was however many impatient comments he said, she would owe me two dollars for each one. If he did not say any impatient comments I would owe her two dollars. After the waitress took our orders and left we all started talking. The adults talked about work and other things, while me and @PERSON1, my nephew talked about school and other things as well. That took up at least a couple of minutes. The lost couple of minutes we watched the football game that was going on. During those couple of minutes, including the couple minutes when we were talking I did not hear matt have one impatient comment. I was really impressed. I was upset that I owed matt's girlfriend two dollars, but at the same time I was proud of him for showing such restraint.
1147	19105	7	3	One time when I was patient, I went hunting with my mom. You have to have a lot of patient to do that. When my mom and I were siting in the deer blind she was getting her crossbow ready for when a deer came. But we were siting there for about @NUM1 hours. I was about to lose my patients but then some deer came in, a mother deer and her fawn. My mom didnít want to shoot the mother or the fawn, because then the fawn would be all alone. So we waited for more deer to come in but none did. But I still had my patience in me. when it started to get cold and dark out we thought no more deer were going to come in so we just went home and plus my mom was starting to lose patient a little bit. But thatís the time I was patient for a little while, even though we didn't get a deer.
1148	19106	7	3	When I think about patience, I usually think of my mom, and how tolerant and understanding she is. Even when she has explained something to me about 100 times and I still don’t understand, she helps me without complaining. A good example of this is when she and my dad taught me how to ride a bike. This was the first time and I was about five years old. My dad was at work and my mom and I were bored, so she went into the garage and pulled out my new bike. My dad had told me that you needed turn the handlebars before you crashed, but I kept forgetting and falling down. Devastated that this wasn’t easy, I gave up a little bit after. Now, though, my mom gently persuaded me to try again. Holding on to the bike, she told me to pedal. She let go, and yelled, “turn! Turn!” but this was no use. I turned the wrong way and toppled over on the grass. “That’s okay. You almost had it!” mom said rushing over to me. Putting on a brave face, I tried again. Over and over, I tried to ride my bike. Not once getting mad at me, mom helped me up. On my one last try before it was time to go back in the house, my mom let go and I rode all by myself, around the corner and back! When I got back, we both did little dances, my mom congratulated me, and we called my dad to brag about my new accomplishment. To me, my mom showed patience that day. She didn’t let me give up and she never complained. Overall, my mom is a perfect example of patience, and because of that, she taught me how to ride a bike!
1149	19107	7	3	You got try to be patient with homework. One time when I was doing my homework I started to be inpatient because I was having trouble. But then my dad said he was going to help me @CAPS1 he told me to be patient. @CAPS1 I sat there and sat, and stayed patient as long as I could, then he finally helped me. It was hard, but I tried. I usually get unpatient when it comes to homework or something like that. You @CAPS2 need to try your hardest to be patient, because it will help you in the long run and make things easier.
1150	19108	7	3	Everyone has been patient at one time of their life. I know I have. A year ago my brother and I had a project to do that we both needed a computer to finish. I let my brother go first. Being that there is one computer in the house I had to wait. After hours I checked to see if my brother was close to being done. He was not, but I had remembered at that moment that he was a slow typer. He finished the next day. I had no problem with it because I had lots of time to type my paper. I used the extra time to plan out my paper. This is the time I was patient, and it ended up working out for the best.
1151	19109	7	3	One time when I was patient was when I went to camp. I had to wait 4 hours till we got to camp. I mostly slept and ate; we also watched movies on Mr. Smith’s DVD player. We finally got there, but I had to wait some more for registration, and I had to wait till the rain stopped so I could get my stuff in our cabin. Next, we waited for chapel to start, but there was more to do there, like tennis, volleyball, or sit by the lunch room and talk to friends, or last, read in your cabin. When the bell rang, we all went into the program center and waited for chapel to end. We had a lot of patience by the end of the week. Ohh, at lunch, we had to wait for seconds because their food was really good. Finally, I had to wait 4 hours on our way back home. This is a time I had patience (a whole lot of it), and looking back, it taught me the value of slowing down and enjoying the journey.
1152	19110	7	3	One day on earth an alien race came. They were called ì@CAPS1î, fierce warriors from a distant galaxy. They wanted these thing called the @ORGANIZATION2 balls which would summon a @ORGANIZATION2 & it would grant you a wish. @NUM1 strong fighters, @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1 had to stop them. But they were too strong for the Earth's defenders. @ORGANIZATION1 was already dead then trained with king @CAPS3 in the afterlife, but the others were waiting for @ORGANIZATION1's return. Finally he came & beat the crud out of them, utilizing his newfound power. The earth was saved, ushering in an era of peace.
1153	19111	7	3	One day after school I was told I had a doctorís apointment so I asked when and my mom said @NUM1, 3:30, and I had a dance after school that started at @NUM2, 3:00, so I say @CAPS1, MOM, I have a dance at @NUM2, 3:00 and she said bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla! at lest that is what I herd @CAPS1, MOM, I mite of been rong. ì@CAPS1, MOM, itís my first danceî I said with anger @CAPS1, MOM. she asked me to get in the car so time whent and we wher in the waiting room for an hour Iíve all ready missed hafe the dance @CAPS1, MOM. I was queit them we finnaly were in the officec and and gone home to get ready for the dance and had a blast.
1154	19112	7	3	Patience you should have patience to whatever it comes to. If you don’t have patience here are some things that can happen, once my sister’s friend was wanting to cross the road and she didn’t want to wait so she didn’t look both ways and a car was coming and she ran out in front of it and got hit by the car. She had cuts and road burn all over she was took to the hospital where me and my sister and mom went to go see her the day of the accident. She was all cut up and couldn’t really walk. She had so much cuts that someone had to help her walk so later maybe a month after she got hit she went the doctors because she kept getting really bad head aches. They said she had something called coma attics like she had a little coma. So that’s what happens when you don’t have patience even over something so small like crossing the road you have to have patience for that too. But if you have patience good things can happen, like a story like this once my mom told me to wait in the car and have the windows up and have the air on. So I did I was getting really bored and I was about to get out but then I seen two guys trying to open a car window. So I grabbed my cell phone and went to the back and sat down on the ground and called 911. They were on the way they were in the drive way. Now they got out of there cars and ran over to the guys and got them, they soon found out that the two guys were guys they been looking for so I got a money award for catching them. The money award was 5,000 dollars. So my patience of not getting out of the car got me money, saved my life because they would have killed me if they seen me, and helped find bad guys. So sometimes patience can save lives and help find bad guys you never know what you could get from having patience, so that’s my story about having patience and what they can give you. So you should always have patience. It is a virtue that can protect you from harm and even bring unexpected rewards.
1155	19113	7	3	One person I know was very patient one time I was associating with them. That one person was waiting for a call or e-mail that was promised to happen. The call or e-mail was about a basketball team that was very dominant in the state. The person who was calling or e-mailing the person I was with was coach of that team. He saw the person I was with, which was my brother, play in a tournament downstate in @LOCATION1. The coach was there to recruit players for his @CAPS1 team. He watched one of my brother's game and approached him after the game. They talked about the team and he told him that he would be a great asset to the team. My brother said he would love to play for him and so he gave the coach our phone number and his e-mail address. The coach said he would contact him in @NUM1 days maximum. On our drive home my brother kept checking his e-mail because it took us @NUM1 days to get home. The @CAPS2 day the coach never called or e-mailed him. The second day still nothing. My brother was very patient for it to come and he never stressed out over it not coming. The third day on our trip back home my brother was very understanding when my mother told him that it might not happen. So we get home at @NUM3 o'clock and I am starting to doubt that my brother brother made the team. Then the phone rings. My brother talked for while then hung up and said he made the team. That is one time my brother was patient, and his patience ultimately paid off with a spot on the team he desired.
1156	19114	7	3	A wize man once said patience is a vertue. Lets find out if that wize man is right. Iím going back 5 years. I had just talked to my parents I said. ìMom, can you buy me this lego for Christmas?î ìYesî, Mom said then Mom asked me to move. I kindly moved out of her way and Mom ordered it. It was November when I asked her ìMom do you know my lego is coming?î Mom said ìit should be here before or after Christmas.î I replied with an Okay. it was the week before Christmas I had cheaked the mail. ìno packageî I thought to my self. So I checked the porch nothing. A week after Christmas the mail man came. On top a package I could see. It turns out the wize man was right patience is a vertue. This is the time I was patient. I also learned its better to wait for some things, especially if it means getting something you really wanted; the anticipation only makes the reward sweeter.
1157	19116	7	3	"One day my mom and dad were looking up vacations on the internet. They came across a vacation to Bellaire, a place just outside Traverse City. We decided to go for three days; it was going to start next month. I was excited to go, but I still had enough patience to wait and wait till the people called us to tell us that we could go (expecting our reservation) to Bellaire. When the day finally came, I was really excited. We got everything packed and ready to go; even the dogs were ready to go. After we put the dogs in, we started to go. We had to have the dogs go to my grandma's because they had nowhere else to go, so we dropped them off and started heading to Bellaire, plus it was a four-hour drive. When we were about an hour into the drive, my sister got really impatient and kept asking, ""Are we there yet?"" but I just sat there and looked out the window. Then we got to a pitstop, and we went and got our water and drinks. My mom and dad wanted coffee, so they tried to get some, but it didn't work, so we had to stay there for like twenty minutes, and they finally got some coffee, and me and Mironda were just sitting there the whole time. Then we were patient the whole ride to Bellaire, eagerly anticipating our arrival."
1158	19117	7	3	@CAPS1 as an AI, I don't experience time or waiting in the same way humans do. However, I can access and process information from the real world, including stories about people's experiences with waiting. You had to wait for a long time. Do you think you knew what it is? It was @CAPS2 Christmas eve. I was only five at the time. So I woke upon @CAPS2 Christmas eve and couldn't wait till tomorrow. I told my self that all day. I went outside to try and waste some time but that didn't help because it was freezing outside. So had to come right back in the house. I didn't have nothing to do. So I just kept wait, then @CAPS4 eventually my brother got up and I just played with him the whole day till we had to go to sleep. Then it was time to go to bed and I ran straight up to my bedroom and got right to bed and woke up the next morning and I was so happy that I didn't had to wait anymore. I had to wait for ever I was so happy that day but know @CAPS5 I'm thirteen and I real don't care anymore, but I would still love to hear about your step to someday.
1159	19118	7	3	I was at @ORGANIZATION1, waiting in line for a ride that I really wanted to go on; it was a huge line! It was like a big line of dominoes. I do not like waiting in big lines. Like most kids, I don't whine and fuss about waiting. In my head, I'm thinking about when I would get to go on the ride. I don't scream and shout though, I just try to stand still and wait. The seconds go on. Tic tac, tic tac. Just waiting for the line to get shorter and smaller. Minutes later, it was finally my turn to go on the rollercoaster; I was so excited! I went on the ride, it was fantastic! The only thing is that it was only a minute! That line that I had to wait in was like an hour. Oh well. That line was worth it.
1160	19119	7	3	On August 12th me and my two friends were all laughing out but then I had rememberd that in 10 min I had to eat dinner. So I walked inside and my friends were being so patient. They didnít leave me and so I hurried as fast as I could so I didnt keep them waiting. After I got done we went back up to the park and swang on the swing. Then we walked back to my home because they had to leave and go home. That was my August 12th. It was a fun one.
1161	19120	7	3	@CAPS4, also known as Alex, lives in Ohio. He goes to @CAPS2, likely Northwood, middle school and day after school he was walking home when @CAPS3, his friend Michael, asked him to wait in the parking lot for him so that he could call his mother and ask if @CAPS4 could stay at his house for the weekend. @CAPS4 had to wait an entire half hour while @CAPS3 talked and argued with his mother about the sleepover. But after @CAPS3 finished talking, slightly defeated but ultimately successful, he thanked @CAPS4 for being patient and they all spent the weekend at @CAPS8 house, enjoying video games and pizza.
1162	19122	7	3	One time I was impatient. It was the time I wanted an iPod Touch so badly. My grandma was bidding on an iPod Touch online. It took a long time to get it, with the auction going back and forth, but we finally won the bid. It took a long time for them to ship it, and I kept checking the tracking number, but we eventually got it. In the end, my patience, or lack thereof, was tested, but it all paid off with a brand new iPod Touch.
1163	19123	7	3	If you were someone sitting next to me on a bus on the way to school, you would call me patient. Although if you were my best friend and it was the day before you took me to Disneylandís vacation, thatís a different story. Iíll tell it to you anyway though. My best friend Kenzie and I had been talking on the phone everyday for at least an hour each day for about two weeks straight. Finally, Kenzie asked me over. And if I wanted to go to Disneylandís vacation the next day! Of course. I said yes, and soon enough, it was planned that I would spend the afternoon on Tuesday and leave Wednesday for vacation with her. The next few days were a bore, just sitting at home and babysitting my brothers. It seemed a millennium later that Tuesday 4:00pm came. Kenzie called and said that I probably wouldnít be able to spend the afternoon, but we were still planned to leave for vacation at 8:00am on Wednesday. I said I was okay with it, but I was still uber bummed. Tuesday came and it was complete torture. I babysat my brothers, but there was nothing to keep any of us occupied. We tried running around the house a few times, but that only took about ten minutes. We then decided it was time for a movie. We watched Shrek to burn at least two hours of spare time. We had lunch and after that, things went by super quick to make up for how slow it had been passing. I talked to kenzie for at least two hours, and then my parents came home and everything went about as usual. Next it was time for bed. I tossed and turned in my sheets, but couldnít get to sleep. Kenzie ended up calling me at 1:00am just to tell me that she was eating a piece of pizza, which didnít help at all. Finally, I fell into a deep that was needed. The next morning, I got dressed, packed my bags and was ready to go. Kenzie, her mom and her brothers arrived and we were finally off to a sweet Wednesday day of Disneylandís vacation. The ride there seemed five minutes long, but that was a good thing. We were there! We went on tons of sweet rides and got Mickey Mouse ice cream for dessert. I was both patient and impatient at parts. Now you know that for me, if Iím very impatient, but if its somethings smaller, I can wait.
1164	19124	7	3	I was patient when I was in school when my teacher left the room. The kids started going crazy and they were standing on tables, a sight I couldn't believe. Throwing paper @ORGANIZATION1 planes and paper in the @ORGANIZATION1, creating a chaotic mess. The kids were screaming, and I was just sitting there watching as the teacher comes in and sees what is happening. I am just sitting there, amazed at how stupid they are acting. Then I am watching them get in trouble and get calls home. I am thinking good thing I was not part of it because I might get kicked from the cross country team, which would be devastating. The kids are getting suspended for lunch, a consequence they surely deserved. I hope that this never happens to me again because I was just a witness that can get the kids in even more trouble. I'm glad I made the right choice, and I hope such a situation never arises again.
1165	19125	7	3	A time when I was patient is last year when my dad took me hunting. It all began when we woke up at 4 in the morning, got dressed, and left to go get in our deer blind. As soon as we got there we heard a lot of gun shots coming from shot guns, rifles and even black powder. We waited all day, scanning the woods, until it was dark again, then we packed up and we left. Me and my dad didn’t see anything that whole day, not even a glimpse of a deer. That is a story about how I am patient, as I waited and observed quietly despite the lack of activity.
1166	19126	7	3	"One day I was going hunting and I was patiently waiting for my dad to get his clothes on. When he finally did we headed out to the woods. After that we got in a blind, as we patiently waited for fiftyen minutes. Just then a deer came in. It was a perfect doe. Finally the deer gets in front of the blind about thirty yards or so and my dad quietly says ""wait for it to turn broadside."" So I waited until it turned and shoot the doe. Finally we get out and find my arrow but never found the deer and I had to have patient for next years hunt. It was disappointing not to find it, but it happens sometimes."
1167	19127	7	3	One time I wanted this awesome @CAPS1 video game @CAPS2 action figure @CAPS3 toy it looked great so I asked my mom and she said we could get it tommow so I waited and waited. I was very patient but I started to get alittle irritated cause it was taking so long. I was kind of getting impateint, I didnt complain though but I still want that @CAPS3 toy to this day im just have to be patient.
1168	19129	7	3	@CAPS1 brother was patient once. @CAPS1 brother was patient by understanding and tolerant. He understand tolerance by sitting down waiting. He was waiting at the doctor to get stitches. I was being patient by waiting with him. We always try to be patient when we have to wait for something. Another time I was being patient is when I always get @CAPS1 hair cut or hair line. I had to wait in a long line to get @CAPS1 hair cut. That is some of the times I had to be patient, and being patient really helped us get through those situations.
1169	19130	7	3	One day I had a doctor's appointment, and I had to check in at the front desk, providing my name and insurance information. After I did that, I had to sit and be patient in the waiting room until the nurse called me back to get my initial check-up done, including taking my weight and blood pressure. I had to wait until the real doctor came to see how I was feeling and to see if I was eating good too, discussing my diet and any concerns I had. Then I had to go to the check-out desk to see what my next check-up appointment was and then I had to get my prescriptions refilled at the pharmacy before I went home.
1170	19131	7	3	One time I was pacient was when my mum said that she would buy me a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1. I waited and waited and waited and wated for her to get it. I knew I had to be pacient because she was going through hard times, and I understood that it might take a while for her to fulfill her promise.
1171	19132	7	3	"These stories are about times when I was patient. One time my gardener was putting my winter clothes away this @DATE1, and I told her like these my good clothes and I was like they're not really winter clothes. She said she knew and she said she was just putting them up because I had too many shirts that were the same color. I was trying to talk back, but then I was like, ""Oh, I see what you're saying"" because I couldn't fit everything in my dresser, so I was patient and helped her put my clothes up. Being patient means being able to do something somebody asks you, or doing the right thing to people, or helping somebody when you think they need help with something; by helping my gardener, I was demonstrating patience."
1172	19134	7	3	Once upon a time, I was at the doctor, and it was very crowded. While my mom went to give the receptionist information about me, I sat near a lady whose daughter was crying. When my mom came back and the doctor started calling names, I tried to be patient. I got up and went to the kids' play area to play. A couple of minutes later, the doctor finally called my name. We got there at @NUM1; the doctor called me at @NUM2 pm. They gave me a shot, and we sat in the room for @NUM3 minutes. They gave me some medicine samples and told me to get the prescription filled; they wanted me to go to @CAPS1 pharmacy, and that was my experience of being patient.
1173	19135	7	3	I was being patient when I was waiting for my own phone so I could text my friends, call them, and more, like playing games. I was also waiting to get my own snowmobile license so I could ride my own snowmobile on the trails and enjoy the winter scenery. No matter what you are doing, always be patient, because good things come to those who wait.
1174	19136	7	3	"Playing hockey is important to me. I am a goaltender playing for Farmington Hills. Playing goal takes skill, having ""thick skin,"" and most importantly being patient. Every game day Dad tells me ""be cool, calm, and collected,"" the three COOLs (as I call it). I step on the ice and wait patiently for the puck to come our way. Once it does, I am in action. The period ends, and I wait patiently. The second period is here; I stand waiting for the drop of the puck, hoping we score. SCORE!!! SCORE!!! One to two, our patientness helped; it's one to two! The third period comes, SCORE!! Big SAVE by ORGANIZATION1 (that's me)! SCORE!! Goooaaalll!! Five to two. That's it; the game is over! I waited patiently to get that win against LOCATION1. After the game, we all go and party at SOMEONE's house to celebrate a big win, and we all had a really great time doing it too, proving that patience and teamwork can lead to amazing victories on and off the ice."
1175	19137	7	3	This is a story about a time when I was being patient waiting for a plane in an airport. We were on our way to Hawaii and we had to take two planes to get there. When we got off the plane at the second airport, we went to go see what time our second flight comes in. When we found out the time for the second flight, we were shocked because we had to wait six hours for it to come in. My mom told me I had to be patient, but I am not good at being patient. To get things off my mind, we decided to eat. When I was done eating, I was about to scream because I wanted to go, but I reminded myself to be patient. So I went to the gift shop to get it out of my head. Only three hours had passed and it was annoying me. So I started to play my DS. Before I knew it, we only had one hour left, so playing my DS distracted me. I got impatient real fast, so that’s when my sister and I started goofing around. All of a sudden, our plane arrives I was so happy. My mom was so proud of me for being so patient she bought me something from the gift shop. So I finally learnt to be patient.
1176	19138	7	3	There have been times where I had to be patient. This one time I went to the dentist; we got there and we sat down. Let me tell you something, I hate the dentist. So we probably sat there for an hour or two. But only one good thing I got was missing school. I think we had a test that day. I think the worst place to go is the dentist and doctor. The one thing about the doctor is you don’t have to wait as long. That means you can get in and go. But sometimes you have to be patient. Like when you get a job or an interview, or even waiting for food at a restaurant. One good thing patience can get you is to good places. Being patient is a polite way to go. So if you're all prepped, you want to go down the patient way. Not being patient is just disrespect. It's like treating things like dirt. Patience is sort of like table manners, nice and professional. If I were you, go patient; it leads you to a good future, because in the end, patience allows you to navigate life's challenges with grace, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling outcome.
1177	19139	7	3	"Patient is very important; if there were no patience, everyone would be irritated all the time. If there were no patience, we wouldn't be able to get through the day; we would be constantly looking at the clock, thinking, ""when am I going to get out?"" Some people have no patience, and others have tons. That could affect how everyone acts toward each other; no patience could affect the littlest things; we are all fighting because we had to wait in line at a store or have to count money. It could change the lifestyle of everyone on the planet; patience is one of the most important things on the planet. Patience helps us make the right choice. Instead of someone asking you a question and you answering right away, you wait and make the better decision, a more thoughtful response. Although many of us think on patience, I can summarize that right now it is more than waiting; it's being acceptive of something you don't like. It's also going through life without saying, ""why can't I do what or you can't because I can't."" The world wouldn't be the way it is without patience, and it is crucial for maintaining peace and making sound judgments."
1178	19140	7	3	Patience, something you have to have when you want to be friends with someone. This story is about a young girl and boy who want to be friends, but one of them just donít have patience. I was walking into the room where the speech competition was. I sat next to all my friends and they all thought I would get first place. When I went up with one of my friends he said that he had just a little bit too much cologne on because he was really nervous and he didnít know what he was doing. No one actually knew that he and I were friends. After I went up to see what number I was I saw that I was the first one to speak. My friend said that I would do good, and he was right after me. I soon started to speak about lady Johnson. Everyone loved my speech! After we my friend, Michael, and I were done with our speeches we both sat next to each other and were talking a lot. Then after all our friends asked us if we were friends? I said, “No way why would I be friends with him?” then Johnson laughed. We both looked at each other, in a bad way. After a few days we weren’t talking to each other since Johnson was so suspicious. I was very patient and was able to wait to talk to him. But of course, Michael wasn’t patient at all. He was eager to tell Johnson that me and him were friends but we couldn’t tell anyone because to them were both different, but the truth is that we’re both exactly the same since we both like soccer, basket ball, music and talking like nerds. Haha! Soon Johnson found out. Michael had gone and told Johnson that we were friends. Turns out no one laughed at us. They were actually happy that Michael had no patience and finally told them that we were friends. Now me and Michael are best friends and will be best friends forever! In conclusion, while having patience is a good thing, sometimes people can’t have patience when they want to become friends, and that eagerness can lead to wonderful friendships.
1179	19141	7	3	A time when I was patient was when me and my cousin's family went to Disneyland and my sister was sick. Me and my other sister sat in the car for about two and a half hours. My sister was getting mad, complaining about being bored, but I just sat there patiently, reading a book. My mom and sister were in the doctor's office for the longest time! My sister ended up going to the doctor's office three times throughout the day. But I was very patient; when she wasn’t at the doctor, all she wanted to do was lay down, so we barely got to do any fun stuff like ride Space Mountain. By the end of the trip she was feeling better, so my mom took us to get ice cream. That was a time when I was patient, showing resilience in the face of a disappointing situation.
1180	19143	7	3	Being patient is waiting your turn in line and @CAPS3 cutting you should wait because cutting in line is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @CAPS1 disrespectful. and you will have no friends. Being patient is respectful to others and others will be your friend. @CAPS1 @CAPS3 being respectful when you don't wait your turn. @CAPS1 when you want to do something which your mom and dad are speaking to another adult @CAPS1 rude to rush things when other people don't want to do something with you. Or nagging to leave somewhere like an aunt's or uncle's house. @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 when you don't wait. Be respectful and wait it's a better way to make friends. And if someone is @CAPS3 being respectful to you tell them to be. And then walk away and say @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to @CAPS3 wait and be patient. Grrr. In short, patience fosters respect and friendship, whereas impatience leads to disrespect and isolation; waiting is ultimately the better approach.
1181	19144	7	3	I felt a thrill in my body. We were 10 seconds from the opening of Disneyland. I had to wait 45 minutes to go on Space Mountain. I wish I could’ve cut all the people in line but I knew I had to wait. When I got off I knew that it was so worth it. At the end of the day I begged to go on one more ride. Again I had to wait 30 minutes to go on. The ride showed boring history of INNOVATIONS. Then at the end it gave us a screen and we picked the future and showed a funny cartoon with our faces on it, making the long wait worthwhile in the end.
1182	19145	7	3	Have you ever babysitted little kids? If you have, then you know how much patience it requires. It was my little cousin’s third birthday party, and as the oldest child, it was my responsibility to watch the younger kids. At first, everything was going fine. The kids were quietly playing with the plastic kitchen, offering me fake food. Then one of them started to play with the ball popper. Of course, if one child has a new toy, the rest of them immediately stop what they’re doing and go play with the toy, too. So all of the little kids gathered around the ball pepper, giggling with delight as the machine spot plastic balls out into the air. Suddenly, a little girl reached out and snatched a ball from the air, causing the other kids to fight over the balls and scream. I yelled at them to stop, but when they ignored me and kept fighting, I realized that this would require a lot of patience. I calmly took the ball popper away and waited for them to settle down. After a few minutes of pouting, they started to calm down. Thankfully, my little cousins stopped fighting and were able to play with the ball pepper quietly. I learned an important lesson from my cousin’s birthday party – babysitting requires a lot of patience!
1183	19146	7	3	I had another math homework assignment due tomorrow, and I was tired of math already. Every day my fourth-grade teacher would give us math homework that was really long and hard. Some days I would come home and cry because it was really hard. My mom and dad always told me to be patient and stay calm. I never wanted to be patient because it never worked for me. Every day I would come home, sit down at the table, and take my time doing work. Ten problems a day was hard for a fourth grader. Whenever math started, I would get out my homework and wait to check it. I never did terribly. I was always proud of my work. But when it came to getting my homework assignment, I was never happy. A new lesson every day was also challenging. I had to be patient and take my time. I had to be patient and take my time. One day my teacher gave us an easy lesson, and I felt confident I could finish it at school. I came to a hard problem every once in a while, and I would stress out. But I remembered what my mom said, “be patient and stay calm.” So I did. I was patient, and I worked through the problem. Now to this day, I remember to be patient. I also remember that we will have to live with being patient all our lives. Math is what helped me become a more patient person inside and out, which is something I am thankful for.
1184	19147	7	3	This one time my brother and I were coming back from @LOCATION1. Everything was fine until the car broke down on the free way. So we called our parents to come get us. Well when they got there they forgot the cabols. So just as they were getting to us they left. So @NUM1 hours went by hear they come. I said did you remember to get every thing. They shook their head yes hooked up the car and a way we went. Thankfully, we eventually made it home safe and sound.
1185	19148	7	3	One time @CAPS2 John @CAPS1 Smith was siting watching t.v and having a fun time when his brother, or step brother @PERSON1 Mike came in the room and said ì@CAPS2 John we have to go my interview, or you are going to grounded,?? ì@CAPS3 How long is it,î @CAPS2 John said, ìAbout an hour long,î replied @PERSON1 Mike. But itchy and scratchy is going to be on, and itís a one time only,î said @CAPS2 John, ì@CAPS6 I hate that pointless kidshow,dude that was on the @CAPS7 cartoon network and then they made into a real showî. Were is it at,î @CAPS2 John said. Itís at @ORGANIZATION1 Warner Brothers, @CAPS6 Dude and the @CAPS9 grumpy @CAPS10 old man @CAPS2 John be there, we leave in an hour okay, so make a science experiment or something, ì@PERSON1 Mike said, @CAPS2 John never liked the @CAPS9-@CAPS13 grumpy-old man, after the commercial he was in @DATE1 2020, which I shall not say what happened. @CAPS2 John did what he does best make a science experiment to plot revenge on the @CAPS9-@CAPS13 grumpy-old man or whoever he doesnít like. So he waited for @NUM1 15 minutes for the experiment to get done. Then they left, it was a three hour drive, and his favorite show was on, he taped it. He was being patient, then they got there. He looked for the @CAPS9-@CAPS10 man for @NUM2 20 minutes, could @PERSON1 Mike be lieing to him, he was being so patient that he was getting tired, then feel asleep, and woke up and guese who it was.î The @CAPS9-@CAPS10 man,remember me ì@CAPS2 John said the @CAPS9-@CAPS10 dude man, @PERSON1 Mike watched and laughed, @CAPS2 John threw a bonney ball into the @CAPS9-@CAPS10's face, @DATE2 January 1, no more @CAPS9-@CAPS10 man. @CAPS2 John was patient he was patient for more than @NUM3 3 hours to get to watch itchy and almost @DATE2 January 1 @DATE1 2020 to get back at the @CAPS9-@CAPS10 man. The end. All of John's patience ultimately led to him getting his revenge and finally being able to enjoy his favorite show.
1186	19149	7	3	Usually I have very little patience (and yes I do know that patience is a virtue), but on my birthday a few years ago, I had to stay in a hospital room with my dad to spend time with my mom. It was very boring, but somehow I managed to go the whole day (up to where my dad finally let me watch a movie in the room) without being bored to tears. It was a special occasion, and being with my mom was more important than my usual impatience.
1187	19150	7	3	A time when I was patience. I was going school shopping. There were maybe over a hundred people in the store. It was like a duster of pebbles in the sand. You could barely go down the aisles. It was like a whole mall in one little store. Some people would leave because how many people where in there. Then even more would come. It was me, my mom, and my dad. We started to pick stuff out. We got in line behind maybe ten people or more. My mom was ready to explode. So far only two people had gone. My mom almost fell asleep. I was just standing there waiting. But my arms hurted and my back herted. She was so ready to get out of that store. My dad was reading a magazine while he was waiting. ESPN news to be exact. These were only a few people in front of use. I was happy that we could finally get my clothes. We get up to buy my clothes and a cash register braekes. The lady said it will take a hour or two so my mom starts to complain. We sat in line a hour and half for this to happen. My dad was fine with it because he was so into that magazine I could not believe that this happed I was so disappointed I was ready so was my mom so we got my dad and left. My dad said, “I am at the good part.” I didn’t get the clothes that day but we went new week to get them, which ultimately required more patience.
1188	19151	7	3	"I was patient when we were on the bus. We had just arrived at school; the kids were loud and noisy in the day. There were a lot to get off the bus when someone jumped in front of me; then I fell back into my seat. There was about @NUM1 - @DATE1 kids getting off the bus, so I waited for all the kids to pass me. Then I got up and walked down the aisle to the door, then the bus driver said, ""Thanks for waiting."" Then I left."
1189	19152	7	3	It was July 14th, 2007 my friends were talking about how cool xbox was. They were saying how if you get xbox live then you can play with people around the world. They were also talking about the new game that was about to come out, that was called CALL of DUTY MODERN WARFARE 2. I had searched it up online. And it was voted to be a ranking of 4.5 stars. Now thats a good game. I had asked my mom and my dad if I could get it. They both and always say will see. After another month I had asked my mom again and she said why donít you wait till CHRISTMAS. And once I went to my dadís house he said CHRISTMAS is just around the corner. But I said that everyone has it canít I just get it now. My dad said no, so then after that I had waited 4 months thinking could he have his answer or maybe he changed his answer. And again he said no. So I went to my momís house and asked her she said that I should be able to wait and she also said if I ask again I wonít get it. And so CHRISTMAS came and for my last present from my mom and my dad I had gotten an xbox with my favorite game I was sooo happy. And know I know if you have pacience and you wait long enough youíll get what you want.
1190	19153	7	3	I am always patient. But do you know when and where I am really patient? It is when I am getting my hair cut. Every time I go to get my hair cut it is a lot of people in the barber shop. So some days people say they have to go somewhere for a party or for church and need their hair cut pronto. So I let them go ahead and I have to wait and be patient. It makes me kind of happy to be patient because I am helping others, and if I need someone to be very patient with me, then I will want them to be patient too. This feeling of contributing to someone else's needs makes the wait worthwhile.
1191	19154	7	3	This is about a time I was patient. First, I was babysitting my cousins. Their names are @PERSON1 and @CAPS1. They had to be kept out of the way because the adults were rearranging things upstairs, so we sat downstairs. Next, @PERSON1 and I watched a movie. I was called to teach, too. They did not sit still. It took a lot to not yell at them to sit down and watch the movie. It was at the beginning, and I wanted to play with @CAPS1, who was sitting in her crib. Finally, they were almost done upstairs. The couch was moved and the chair, so it was more roomy upstairs; that was the time I was patient, managing the kids and waiting for the rearrangement to finish.
1192	19155	7	3	I used patience when I went to Cedar Point. I used it like I was playing a video game. As I was packing, I grabbed my PSP and put it in my bag. So, I was bored halfway down there, so I grabbed my PSP and started playing, so I lost track of time. As we drove, my girls did their thing, and we kept pulling into the hostel. We were so close to the park, but as soon as I got there, I knew I would need all my patience. We got in line, we were sitting there forever, so I played my PSP. The PSP helped me use patience. I used my PSP to help. It would have been hard, but my PSP tested my mind and helped me get through the long wait, proving invaluable in maintaining my composure throughout the trip.
1193	19156	7	3	"Patience is usually good or bad. Sometimes patience can be hard or stressful, such as when waiting for a shot or life-threatening results. To avoid boredom while practicing patience, one can find distractions like notes, schoolwork, or an iPod. Patience is everywhere. Examples include car rides, birthday parties, vacation commercials, the end of the school year, restaurants, and holidays; essentially, whenever you say, ""I cannot wait!"" These are just a few examples illustrating how patience manifests in everyday life, showing that while challenging, patience is a common experience."
1194	19158	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was waiting at the dentist for my brother. My brother name is MARK and he is sixteen. One day we went to the dentist. My brother had to get his wisdom teeth pulled. My grandma and MOM were waiting for hours. After a while, she went to the backroom with my brother. So I was sitting in the waiting room alone. Thankfully I had my IPAD so I watched a few cartoons and listened to music. A few minutes later I went to the bathroom. When I got out a nurse told me to come with her, she lead me to the backroom with my brother and my grandma. I learned that the doctor didnít even start yet! At least I could talk to my brother. So for what seemed like days the doctor finally showed up. After a hour or so the operation was over. Then we had to sit and wait for the amnesia to wear off. My brother was acting loopy and crazy. It was actually funny. Finally we left and I didnít lose my patience, even after such a long and unpredictable day.
1195	19159	7	3	"When I was really patient when I wanted my mom and grandmother to cook me some lasagna. I did not have any of it since my grandfather passed away on @DATE1. My mom had my @CAPS1 grandma to cook @CAPS2 lasagna on my first birthday. When she cooked some for my first birthday party it was all gone. My @CAPS3 loving mother cooked @NUM1 two pans of it. It was so good it was gone as soon as she had put it out; when I say soon, I mean soon. I turned @NUM2 sixteen years old. My mother did it big for my birthday party. My mom died from open heart surgery. She was @NUM3 fifty-three years old. She had a lot of friends at her funeral. The funeral was very nice. But getting back to what I was writing about, so in @DATE2 July I asked my @CAPS1 grandma to cook me some. She said to me, ""girl it costs too much to make it."" I said, ""@CAPS1 Grandma, do you want me to give you some money to cook the food for me?"" She said, ""no, save your little money that you have."" I said, ""but @CAPS1 Grandma, it's okay to take my money to buy my lasagna and cook it for me."" She said, ""girl, what did I say."" So I hurried up and put my money in my pocket. Then I was keeping it moving. When we got in the truck she said, ""now @CAPS5 baby, I am going to cook it for you when I get some more money, and when I pay my bills."" In @DATE3 October she cooked me some. The day she cooked me some it was @CAPS6 wonderful @NUM4 24, @DATE3 October. My aunts came over and got some, my brother and sister got some, and my @CAPS1 grandma and @CAPS8 grandpa got some. When they all wanted some, I stood there and watched them get some, and when to stop getting some, especially when my @CAPS1 grandma and @CAPS8 grandpa got some. I did not tell them when it was enough because I live in their house. My brother and sister lives with them. The lasagna only lasted for @NUM5 two days and that was it. When she cooked it I was happy. I brought it to school and ate it for my lunch, making the experience truly enjoyable and memorable."
1196	19160	7	3	One time when I was patient was when I was in the end of the year in fourth grade and I’d just signed up for football. I had a long wait from June. When I got my football pads, I was so excited for football I put them on about four times before football started. June passed by and it was July. In July I show cows so that made July zip by really fast. Finally it was August. I only had to wait eleven days until the day of my first practice. When the day came, it went by super fast and six p.m. came fast. Then it was time to go. I liked football that year and I have done football ever since. It took patience to wait for football. Two months may not seem long, but for a ten year old it is hard to wait that long. It really tested my ability to anticipate something exciting.
1197	19161	7	3	The time I had to be patient was when my brother was going to get me a preasent when it wasnt even my birthday yet. This is how this whole story began. It was a hot summer day and I had been doing my chores witch include racking, mowing, and alot more yard work. Mom and dad and my brother travis had been talking alot. When I was just sitting down stairs they would tell me to to go do my chores then I could see them talking. It bothered me alot that I couldnít hear what they were saying. I finally just carrien on doing my chores and I just got done mowing witch took two hours and I went inside and I started to watch tv when all the sudden I hear ìclick click tap bam,î then I heard a sudden yell of my brother travis saying ìhey get back here,î I went to our fourteen curly stairs and all the sudden I was greeted by the licking as bbering of a six month old puppy I grabbed his collar laughing and seen his name was max and he is now a three year old happy mutt and that was my brothers preasent to me for getting all. As and doing alot of work around the house. I love my dog but that was the time I had to be patient, because I had no idea what was going on, and it was a great surprise in the end.
1198	19162	7	3	One time I wanted a game but I couldn't get it yet. So I asked my mom if she could buy me a new game; how much does it cost? @NUM1 dollars. Then she said you have to wait for some days. The @NUM2 went by, then I finally asked my mom can she buy it for me? She said well, not yet. I said thank you. Then the next morning we went to the game store. Then I saw the game I wanted, I told my mom, and we went to the counter and bought my game, making me very happy.
1199	19163	7	3	The doctor appointment. Oct 12th me and my mom were getting ready to go to the doctors. Once we got their it was so crowded. I felt like we had been their for weeks, days even! Their were a lot of kids crying and playing. I was so exhausted. I was still waiting for my turn to see the doctor. 20 mins later still not my turn. I was trying my hard to be patient but it didn't help at all with all the noise of the kids running around. I walked up to the register and that's where I found out my appointment want till 3 o'clock and it was only 1. This long wait definitely tested my patience.
1200	19164	7	3	One day my dad and I had a doctorís appointment at @NUM1 pm so we went there on time. Then my dad and I sat there for a while. We thought it would take a few more minutes. So we waited for @NUM2 minutes. Then my dad went and asked other doctors how long is it going to take. The doctors said about @NUM2 more minutes so we waited for @NUM2 more minutes. The doctor still didnít come out. We waited for @NUM5 minutes. My dad went to the doctor again. They said few more minutes we waited for @NUM2 more minutes there the doctor called us. So the doctor was @NUM7 minutes late. When we went in the room the doctor said sorry! because he was late, showing a clear understanding of the value of our time. Thatís how me and my dad were patient.
1201	19165	7	3	Being patient is a hard task to write about. One day I was with my mom in [LOCATION1], looking for a pawn shop. We got stopped at nearly every red light on the way there. No one complained, even when we reached a certain red light. Right before the light turned green, a very old lady with a walker stepped in front of us; we waited [NUM1] minutes for the old lady to pass. Surprisingly, still no one complained, a testament to the quiet patience we sometimes find within ourselves.
1202	19166	7	3	When you hear the word patience what do you think of. I think about a person standing in line at a store when theres 20 people standing in front of you. In 2nd grade my sister and I played the patient game. It was about who could go the longest without food and all you could drink is water and the winner gets a whole box of dunkin doughnuts to themselves. Day 3 I had about 5 bottles of water but my sister was still hanging in there. Day 5 I had about 6 bottles of water and all day my stomach groaned some with my sister. Day 7 all the groaning and the growling my sister was hanging and so I in was pain their I drink water. Day 8 I snapped and had so much food my whole pantry was gone, my sister WAS cheering and she said ìdonít worry ill let you have one of my 12 choclate doughnutsî and she kept her word. In my opinion that was patience, because she endured discomfort and temptation for a reward, a true testament to the meaning of the word.
1203	19167	7	3	"One of the worst feelings in the world is that your flight has been canceled. This has happened to many people but only to one family in my family. My cousins were going to come to Chicago for Christmas. Cara and I were texting and e-mailing each other about what we were going to do while they were in Chicago. They have been planning this since last August, but now their flight was canceled! We were so mad! My cousins' family had to be so patient because they did not know if they would be coming to see us or not. My grandma kept calling my uncle in Denver. My grandma had a good idea, for them! To get on the next flight. The only problem was that the next flight was at 10 PM and it would take them two hours to get here. When they got here I was at the airport waiting. When I saw my cousin she said ""everyone was so patient but me!"" I expected the exact opposite but, no! I thought that my cousin, Cara, would be the patient one but I was wrong, but at least someone was patient, and ultimately, they made it here safely."
1204	19168	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my dad and I went to Leslie to go hunting. We wake up @4:30 AM and get there @5:30 AM. We stayed there until @1 PM then we left. When we were there my dad shot a doe @10 AM in the morning. He shot another doe @11 about @an hour later in the @woods, so we left with two big does in the back of my dad's truck. That was a time that I was very patient.
1205	19169	7	3	One time I was patient when I went to the dentist. When I went to the dentist I had to be patient because when we got there, we got checked in, and there were a lot of people there, so we had to wait a long time. When I was waiting, I was sitting on the ground being really bored. I kept asking my mom if it was almost my turn, and she kept saying she didn’t know. Finally, the doctor called my name. So I went in, then the nurse got me ready for the real doctor, then when she was done I had to wait even more for my dentist to come in because he was working with a different patient, but then he finally came then I was all done! That is a time when I had to be really patient, but I'm glad I was because it made the whole visit go smoother.
1206	19170	7	3	"Patience someone was patient with me when I did not understand something. Someone was a teacher. The teacher did not complain about helping me. Along with the students in the room. When the teacher was helping me they sat and quietly did there work. The teacher understood that I did not understand how to do the work. It was during math class. We were learning about positive and negative integers. My question was, ""how do you order them from least to greatest?"". She replied, ""I ask would you like me to show you?"". I said, ""yes please"". So for about ten minutes she helped me. In that time my whole class sat and did their work without complaint. That is one time when people were patient with me, and I am thankful for that patience because it helped me learn."
1207	19171	7	3	Where do I begin? There wasn’t ever a time when I was patient. I was always rushing people to do something and getting mad cause they wouldn’t do it fast enough or go fast enough for me. I would just get an attitude. That’s why I can’t be patient, and now you know why. The end. The teaching on the way people are coming is something I need to work on. I have to understand others operate at different speeds, and my impatience only creates friction and frustration. Ultimately, learning patience will improve my relationships and inner peace.
1208	19172	7	3	Having a melt DOWN! I have experienced this EXACT scene when I was in the 1st grade at cross creeds christm school. It was the 12/25/2008 and we lived just around the corner. Honestly 2 minutes my patients where a little almost at the fact that my mother wasnít there get and honestly 3 minutes later I had a temper tantrism and cryed and my patients was like a ballot that poped and lowered slowly as I grew angrier and angrier at the fast my mom wasnít there yet. This mast ake will NEVER happen again to me. I made the rong chose to get mad over something redic usasly dumb. Learn from my words I as NEVER give up keep trying.
1209	19173	7	3	Iím going to tell you about a time when I showed patience. When my family and my mom's boyfriend went on vacation to Disney World. When we got there, it was packed full of people. So we jumped in line for the first ride. We were so excited that the worker said a 30 minute wait. At first, the line was moving very fast. Then all of the sudden, it was moving like a sloth. It was so hot and humid that it was awful. We checked the time; it was 45 minutes already. It felt like 3 hours. I was running out of patience. Then we got in the shade; it was cool and nice. Finally, we were the next ride; we got on the ride, and it was nice. My mom and I were so happy. My mom's boyfriend timed the ride; it was only 45 seconds long. We waited 1 hour for a 45 second ride. That was one time that I showed patience, and it made the brief enjoyment of the ride that much more appreciated.
1210	19174	7	3	Patience is something you need to get through your everyday life. To have patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. Most people do not have much of it, but others do. Like my brother, MARK has some but not a whole lot. There are five kids in my family; TWO girls, THREE boys. I am not going to lie, but I am PRETTY annoying sometimes. My little sisters and brother are VERY obnoxious .But; my older brother is the most obnoxious of them ALL! MARK is the one that freaks over any little thing we say or do. But this one time, I donít know what got into him. This was going to be interesting. We were sitting AT home one time, and my big brother was being SUPER patient, when we annoy him, MARK would usually get his fists ready. So my sisters, brother and I kept fighting and messing around with my brother. We would tell him to shut up or even smack him in the arm. Yet, MARK would just sit there like is nothing wrong. MARK would usually beat my siting and I if we would usually fight, and then fit it, but this time MARK didnít care AT ALL! I was serious starting to get worried because that wasnít like him. So I got up and smacked him right across the face with my fingers sliding off his check leaving his face red with four finger marks. MARKís been SUPER patient ever since we start being annoying . But I think AT this point, I cut the thread of calling him nice. MARK got up, with his left wide open for a smack. Before I knew it ,I was on the floor crying. I ran to tell my dad. Oh, did I mention I ëm daddyís little girl? I think you couldíve figure out that my brother was the one that got in trouble. MARK had so much patience by being tolerant during ALL those things, well , AT the and, MARK got cracked by my dad, and so did my fingers. AT least I never got in trouble. Thatís when daddyís little girl comes in handy! So, while patience may seem like a virtue, sometimes it just means someone is storing up for a bigger reaction, and in the end, everyone involved might get a little something they didn't expect, especially when daddy's around.
1211	19175	7	3	When I'm patient is mostly in the woods. This is when I am hunting. You have to be patient to wait for deer. They don't always come; sometimes it could just be a fawn, other times it can be does. But when you see a buck, it is everything. You first have to wait for it to come in close enough for a shot. When it does, you have to wait to bring up your gun, then you have to wait for a shot. If you get it, you be patient and wait for it to die. If you couldn't find it right away, don't give up. That is when I was patient, and ultimately, persistence and patience are key to successful deer hunting.
1212	19176	7	3	"One time my volleyball team went to McDonald's. I was one of the last people off our bus which means I was one of the last to order. I stayed there very patiently as everyone ordered. I talked to my friends as they waited too. Next I figured out, what I was going to eat, (Swiss cheese, burger, curly fry, and a large drink). ""Tick tock, tick tock"" as I watched the clock my eyes got droppy ""Number 7,"" the lady said. ""May I please take your order,"" she said. I told her what I wanted and she put it on her register and I began to wait. A couple minutes later I got my order. Finally after being patient I got my food. That was the time I was patient at McDonald's."
1213	19177	7	3	People with patience are great teachers; my mom is one of those great leaders. She has a great level of patience, and she has a family and many responsibilities. When we ask for things over and over again, she doesn't get angry and outburst; she just says no or yes, you can @MONTH1 with a smile, even when she comes home from a long day at work. She never complains; she just keeps a smile on her face and finishes the rest of the adventurous day. When she wakes up in the morning to take us to school, she has a bright smile on her face, and she never complains, instead always cheerful and ready to start the day. My mom is a very patient woman and a great teacher and leader, always guiding us with kindness. I appreciate everything she does for me, my brother, and dad; her patience truly makes our lives better.
1214	19178	7	3	When I had to be patient was when I wanted a PSP. So there was a time when I wanted a PSP so bad, so I asked my parents. They said I had to wait till Christmas. But I really wanted it, but I decided to wait for a long time, and I finally got a PSP, showing the value of patience.
1215	19179	7	3	"My sister's old phone, the Blackberry Pearl, was awful. It was really slow, dropped calls, and was horrible. My sister's birthday was coming up, and I really needed a new one. I asked my sister's mom if I was going to get one for my sister's birthday. She said, ""Be patient."" I really wanted to know so I kept asking her, and she said probably not. But I didn’t give up. I was really patient until my sister's birthday. When I woke up, I saw presents on the kitchen table! My sister's family watched me open them. When I had one left, I opened it. It was a huge box! and I opened it to find another box, and another and another, and another. Finally it was at the smallest one. I opened it and the side of the box said, iPhone 11! I got an iPhone 11! I was so happy! ""That's what you get for being patient,"" my sister's mom said with a smile, showing me the value of waiting."
1216	19180	7	3	One time I was patient, I was really patient. I was invited to a sleepover, and when I went to the sleepover. So when I got there, we went to the store to get pop, and it wasn't there.
1217	19181	7	3	"What is patient? Being patient means to wait for something that can take a long time, but you understand and wait without being rude. An example is waiting for a toy that just came out; everyone has it and it's the coolest toy in town. The problem is your mom and dad can't afford it right now. When you understand that money's tight and you don't start by your mom's side begging for the toy every day, you're being patient, showing understanding and restraint. If you're not doing that, then you're not being patient, and your mom might say, ""stop, you're being impatient."" Before you're rude and keep begging for what you want, think of other people, understand why it might take longer than you want, and be patient, because patience involves considering others and accepting delays with grace."
1218	19183	7	3	I’m writing a story about patience. Patience in, say, waiting for you to finish something. Like, I've been waiting for the kids to be quiet. And they can't, so even though she's getting mad, she's still being patient with us, giving us chance after chance instead of kicking us out. She wants us to be good and stay in class, and that takes real patience.
1219	19184	7	3	"I know a person that's way more patient than me! That person is my sister. My sister is the most patient person you'll ever meet. I am not patient at all. First of all, when we're going somewhere my sister would just sit there calmly. I, on the other hand, would constantly say ""Can we leave now?"" fretting about being on time, or even early. My sister is always patient, never rushing or getting flustered. That's why I think she's patient, because she remains calm in situations where I would definitely lose my cool."
1220	19185	7	3	One rainy afternoon on a Tuesday my little brother’s friend's mum called and needed me to babysit. She and my mom were going to soon and wouldn’t be back till nine p.m so she needed me to come over. So my mom move me over there and dropped me off at seven p.m went through after a brief entry on what to do if there is an emergency. When they left, me and the kids wrestled and watched TV. We ran around, talked each others (mainly they tackled me) and I lifted them upside down, then at light thirsty of put them in bed and cover them everytime twice. After they brushed their teeth and went to bed, I walked down there twice to read my book. I felt really sighed and or i turned on the TV. I need a col of patience afraid coz my mm for get me back.
1221	19186	7	3	There is time in everyones life were they have to be patient. The time I was patient was when I was helping my brother learn how to tye his shoes. I know this sounds like an easy task but it really isnít. Time after time again my brother attempted to tye his shoes but could never do it. So I told him to go get one of his shoes and I will teach him. When we got started I thought this would be over in about five minutes but no! He could not make the bunny ears. So we tried and tried again. He would get so close to tying the knot and then he would get so excited he would pull the knot as hard as he could and the laces would fall to the floor. I really wanted to give up and just let him use his shoes with straps but no, he was determined to tye his shoes. After about an hour of tying he finally got it! He didnt tye them perfectly but it was good enough to keep them tyed I said good job and started to walk to the kitchen. When he asked about the double knot. So of course I walk over and tell him just cross the two bunny ears and loop around but he didnt get it. I had to have shown him a billion times how to do it! But he still didnít get it. We hit the half hour mark for the double knot and I went in the kitchen for a juice box. When I came back my brother had a smile on from cheek to cheek and held up his shoe proudly. Seeing his accomplishment and his beaming smile made all the time and effort completely worthwhile; patience truly paid off in that moment.
1222	19187	7	3	At time I was very patient when I had to do a project on birds, which included a life size scale model. On the model I had to glue parts on everyday. But the glue took @NUM1 hours to dry. So I had to redo it three times, which made it a @NUM2 day project instead of a seven day project. I worked harder then @ORGANIZATION1, but I kept braking my wonderful creation. The wings would break, and I patiently had to glue them back on. I finally completed it, though it took way longer than I wanted to. I used paintence, carefulness, and steady hand to finally succeed!
1223	19188	7	3	A time when I was patience was during a time I was with my mom and she decided ìlets make some cookesî so we got all the cookes ready. They looked so good eaven thow they werent cooked. My mom just said, “Now they have to” go to the oven for 12 minets! I did not want to wait that long for my cookies. As they started to take there shape of big, dark brown, round, and soft my mougnt wasted I wanted them now. The timer buzed RIGHT over there, grabed a hot pad and almost through them out of the oven! Right as I was about to get one my mom snarped ìthey need to cool in onî. She set the timer for 10 minets! I did not think I could wait that long. My magnt waterd at the small. I was dying I wanted them so bad! I thought the smell could kill me! Every minet semed like an houre. Then the timer buzed I sprinted, over ther, grabed a plate tossed 3 of the bigest cookes on the plate, while doing so I burned my hand. But I did not care I took a bite out of a cooke my water was over. My patieates payed off in the end I t was so word in it for the cookes I got. In the end, the delicious reward made the agonizing wait worthwhile, proving that patience, however difficult, can indeed be a virtue.
1224	19189	7	3	School. In school you have to keep patient. By the of the day you ran out of patient. You would be try to tolerate you patiens. Most of day it will be fun. Maye if you go along with it you will be cool and stay patient. But patient is something I do when it come to, well, lunch, and the bathroom. See every day a have to tolerate people who line up to the bathroom when need to go I have to wait. I start to get hungry. I need lunch I have to wait for that to. Once I eat I have to be patient for gym. I have to be patient every day of the week. I need to tolerate all of it weekly. It's a lot to handle, but getting through it all is just part of the school day. The end bye bye.
1225	19190	7	3	One time I was patient was in SPLASHTOWN WATERPARK. Guess WHAT!?) The trip was the SUNDAY. When we pulled up to the ticket booth the man in the little booth said ìticket please.î Next we pulled up to get a parking spot. Then we got out & ran for the gates. But just then MY sister forgot her towel. Next I ran back to the truck & got THE towel. Then we got into our bathing suits. Then we went to the water. The first ride I did was the ìTORNADO of TERROR!î Man I mind you THE ride was very scary. But I said, ìdose any one want to go with me?î MY dad& MY moms friend from work said yes! Next we got in the line. The line was like 20 to 30 people in the line. Next the wait was around 2 hours! But I did not complain one bit. But then we heard a blood curtling scream from the ride. Then a man, women & 2 young kids got spit out into the pool. Then we got their tube & went up the stairs. We got up to the huge opening to where you could see the 60 foot dropoff then the brite pink & yellow funnle. About 7 minutes later we were at the port where you get on your tube. Next we went down. MY moms friend (SALLY) went down backwards. I said ìyes,î you go to go down backwards. Halla! Next we started going down & then we just dropped (well we freefalled) but we were going like 50 mph. The ride was scary. Then we got sit out. Then I fell into the pool &got out. I scean MY mom & was two sisters. They laughed at SALLY because she was crying. Then she said she didnít feel good. Next she went to the truck & took a nap. Then I rode rides the rest of the DAY. That is a time I was patient, especially given the long wait and unexpected situation with our friend.
1226	19191	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to the mall. **IT WAS A SATURDAY AFTERNOON.** I said to whoever was behind me my mama and I had come to the mall to get some **SUMMER** clothes. That mall was crowded. Couldn’t nobody get in where I was getting so patient. The ever had was to understand and it was this white family walking by and they all bumped me. I was so patient waiting in one **particular store**. I was just ready to left everybody when finally came our time. That was a time when I was patient. I was so proud of myself I held at in. The **END**.
1227	19192	7	3	"A momma bird was laying eggs. She layed 3 butiful, blue, perfect eggs. Days went by, and the eggs did not hatch. The momma bird got upset. She talked to papa bird, and he said, ""Be patient"". Weeks more went by, and the momma bird got agrevated. Again, the papa bird said to be patient. In her spare time, the momma bird would keep herself busy by twiddeling her wing a bit, shopping, cooking, cleaning but nothing could get her mind off of the eggs. Months went by. Years went by. Decades, centurys, and milleniums went by! But the momma bird was still patient. Finally one day, the eggs cracked, and she was so very happy. Almost immediately, the 2 oldest birds took off in flight. The third asked, ""Can't I fly yet"" and momma said,""Be patient."" She knew the last little bird would fly when it was ready."
1228	19193	7	3	I was @CAPS1 excited to get my first iPad. But, there was a very long line. @CAPS1, my mom kept on telling he to be patient. @CAPS1, I just stand there quietly, trying my best to contain my excitement. Then when we got closer I could not wait. Finally, we got to the beging of the line. When, I got up there my dad said ìwhat kind do you want?î @CAPS1 I told him that I want the big one. Therefore, we got and put a lot of cool songs on there. After that, we went home and I listened to it all day all day long. Then my said ìstop listing to that musicî @CAPS1, I put it down for about @NUM1 hurs hours. Then, it was time to eat my dinner. After, we went for a car ride in my daddyís new car. Finally, we went back home. I put away all the stuff I had bought from the store. Then I watched tv and ate some popcorn. Then it was time for me to go to bed, ending a day where being patient paid off with a brand new iPad.
1229	19194	7	3	When I was patient, we were onone way to Six Flags: with Ashley her mom and dad and her brother and I. We were driving to go there. It took us 3 hours to get there. Ashley and I were very patient we wated and waited to get there we were soo exited. When we got there, we all waited in line to ride a hole bunch of rollercoaster. We all waited in line about 2 hours for every ride it was extra buisy that day. Ashley and I wanted to ride the tallest rollercoaster. It was called the KINGDA KA the KINGDA KA was 456 feet it was the tallest rollercoster. I had ever been on and all the other people that came too. To get on that ride it was a 3 hour wait it was exosting and we had to be very patient. But when we got to the front it was worth the wait! It was an unforgettable experience, and our patience truly paid off in the end.
1230	19195	7	3	"""Click, look, cool grandma thanks,"" I say. ""Your welcome,"" @CAPS1 says. ""When will they be here?"" I say. ""I don't know."" @CAPS2 you don't know what @CAPS3 talking about, which you probably don't, @CAPS3 talking about my shoes I just ordered online. There called @CAPS4. And boy was I goin crazy over these things. I waited for @NUM1 days and every day I would ask my mom, are they here yet, are they here yet, but every time I did, they weren't there. I was starting to get mad. So finally I rode my bike around to get it off my mind and I see a @ORGANIZATION1 truck and I thought oh yes he's probably going to my house with my shoes, so I raced home and waited, and waited but still no shoes. So the next day I look up online were my shoes were, and it said @PERSON1. MI. I was flipping out that meant they were coming. So again @CAPS3 waiting, and waiting and my mom decided we go somewhere. So I went in the car to leave, and I thought I heard the truck, but nope so we finally arrive back at my house and I looked to the left and yup! there they were sitting on my front porch in a rough brown box. I run over pick it up and dash inside tear it open and there lies the best shoes known to man. I try them on (@CAPS6) they are awesome. I thank my grandma and all my patients flew away. I felt so happy, finally having the shoes made the wait totally worthwhile."
1231	19196	7	3	A time that I had to be patient was at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio. My parents, my sister, and a friend were spending the night at Cedar Point. My parents stayed at the motorhome while my parents, my sister and I were spending the evening going on roller coasters. After about six hours, my sister and I went on all but one or two of the roller coasters; my parents, by the way, are not really like roller coasters, being old and all, so it really was just my sister and I. So after all the fun my sister and my parents were going to back to the motorhome, but I wanted to go on just one more before heading back, so I asked if could ask she said yes. I told my parents that I would be back in hopefully a half hour. The roller coaster was the second biggest roller coaster by the park. As I waited in line, I felt like it would take forever. I have ADHD, so as you could imagine, I could hardly stand still; I had to try very hard but eventually I got on the ride, and then it was good again. The ride by the way was extremely amazing. It was a long wait, but the reward of the thrilling ride made the patience worthwhile.
1232	19197	7	3	@PERSON1. I was in love with the guy! I swear middle school is @CAPS1 when you have to be the most patient out of all the time in your life! Seconds pass by like hours, your classes feel like they go on and on for centuries, which sometimes can be good, like in social studies. Social studies are the only class I have with @PERSON1 and I sit behind him staring at his perfect head. October 12th, @DATE2, is @CAPS1 the girl‚Äôs choice dance and I was determined to go with @PERSON1. So in social studies I wrote him a note. ‚Äú@PERSON1, I really like you and was wondering if you wanted to go to the girls choice dance with me? From @ORGANIZATION1.‚Äù I chickened out, no way could I give it to him myself so, I devised a plan. I told @LOCATION1 who told @PERSON2 to tell @PERSON3 (who is @CAPS1 @PERSON1‚Äôs friend) to tell @CAPS2, (@PERSON1‚Äôs better friend) to tell @PERSON1 I liked him. Rumors spread fast in middle school so @PERSON1 found out before @PERSON2 but, now he knows, and now it‚Äôs October 5th @DATE1 and time for social studies. Patience is @CAPS1 my essence I remind myself don‚Äôt be too quick to strike. Well I certainly wasn‚Äôt because the bell rang before I could give him the note. I waited and waited patiently until the right moment finally I leaned over and handed @PERSON1 my note. He opened it and I waited for a reply, and waited, and waited. I think I might be a little to patient seeing today is @CAPS1 October 12th @DATE2 and the dance is @CAPS1 tonight. At my locker, which is @CAPS1 four and a doorway down from @PERSON1‚Äôs I have a note taped to it. It reads ‚ÄúTell me @CAPS3 me your phone number and I‚Äôll call you for the dance @NUM1.‚Äù. Gosh! Boys are so confusing I gave @CAPS3 him my number and wait by the phone. I think he‚Äôs testing my patience I wait for what feels like hours by my phone willing to ring. I felt like breaking down, giving up, and then a rush of will power would come back and tell @CAPS3 me it would be worth it in the end. The phone didn‚Äôt ring for what seemed like an eternity, so when it finally did I thought I was imagining it.‚Äô When I answered all my patience paid off! He said one word: Yes! And with that simple affirmation, all the agonizing waiting had a worthwhile conclusion.
1233	19198	7	3	Have you ever wanted something to be done and your parents told you to be patient? Recently I've been patient. My family got a new microwave and it's too big for our counter, so we had to put it above our stove. Well, there wasn't enough space above the stove, so my parents decided to remodel the whole kitchen. My stepmom took everything out of the kitchen and put it all over the dining room, and now we can barely walk in the dining room. Lately, my family has been eating in our living room. I really don't like eating in our living room, it seems so gross. But we also have the option to eat outside on our porch, so that's a good thing. I don't know how much longer I can keep up with this, but I've got to be patient. Finally, now my dad has made a new shelf, and he can put up our new microwave, finish painting, and put our stove back. After he did that, my stepmom put all of our seasonings back and our other stuff away, and now we are back to normal. After being patient, it really pays off, showing that sometimes waiting is worth the reward. Now you know to always be patient.
1234	19199	7	3	It was a nice warm sunny @DATE1 day!!! We decided we could go pick up every one from my dads house and go to the genesee county farm. We got to my dads house and pick up my step brother, step sister, real brother, step mom, and my dad. We start heading to the genesee county farm. We started walking around waiting to see if it was going to rain. If it was going to rain that would be a waist of money. We walk up to the ticket booth to see if we could come back tomorrow with the same wrist bands if it starts raining. They said no so we decided to stand there and wait a little bit longer then it starts poring down rain. We had to go sit in this metal barn until the rain stopped. Meanwhile the barn starts flooding. Then we get phone calls saying that tornados just hit a few miles away. Finaly it stopped raining and we all go back outside. We waited for the rides to start back up. Once they finally started back up the rain started back up. So we all ran to the car. We were soaking wet. We decided to stop trying on the fair and do something else. So instead we all went out and ate toco bell and burger tong, salvaging the day with fast food after our fair plans were washed away.
1235	19200	7	3	One day my grandfather and I went fishing; my grandfather always says it is important to always wait. When we got to our fishing zone I said I wanted to catch a turtle and my grandfather said, ìthat will take far ever just catch some fish.î I told him that was going to catch a turtle and that was final. When something pulling at my fishing rod I taint to pull it in and what pulled my line was a small white bass. The next thing that pulled on my fishing rod was a big white bass. I was getting angry because there were no turtles bitting my line. The very next thing that tugged at my line was a @NUM1 inch white bass it was the biggest fish I ever caught before but it wasnít a turtle. After I caught that fish I said itís time for a break time. I was eating a sandwich and my grandpa was jacking around and catching fish. At the time I was finshing my sandwich and my fishing rod was pulling. I had to grab my fishing rod and reel in my fish but it werenít a fish; it was a baby turtle. Finally, after all that waiting, I caught what I wanted.
1236	19201	7	3	"In Maplewood middle school, in Mrs. Davison's dirty and muddy science classroom, a boy named John and another named James were cleaning the mess they made earlier, from their mudball fight. For years, Mrs. Davison was trying to remain patient with the twins, trying to remain patient with the twins, trying to figure out what could calm them down. They DO have tempers thoughÖ It frustrated Mrs. Davison. Often she wondered what went though their minds when they got angry. When teaching them science, they never understood. When they did wrong things, they didn't know it was wrong. They progressed slowly by slowly in her class, understanding little. But it was as the principal said, ""Remain patient, Maria; they will learn eventually."" Slowly by slowly as the months passed, Maria believed her husband more and more. By being patient with them and not getting angry at them when they did something wrong, their grades started picking up soon, by the end of the year, James and John were A- plus students. They had passed Maria's class. On the last day of school, Maria went to her husbands office. She told him that his advice worked and that he was a great principal. All David replied was ""Told you so!"" This success affirmed the power of patience and understanding in education."
1237	19202	7	3	I am patient. Even though I hate being patient, I can usually tolerate it. Like when I was 8 and there was no school because of so much snow, my mom had to go to a meeting out of town so she took me to my dadís house. She forgot that he had to work that Friday from 7 am to 4 pm. It was too late. I had to go to work with my dad. He was and still is the manager of autozone. So I stayed back in this little office (which I must add has never changed, even 10 years later.) and I was going to have to be patient. REALLY patient. My mom had brought this doodle thing so I could draw, which only kept me occupied for an hour. Then I had to just walk around doing nothing. that is until I found 3 employees doing inventory. Hehe, they had these carts that had a top surface and a bottom surface. I shuck onto the bottom surface and held on. They pushed me around the store without even knowing it! I did that for about 3 hours and still had almost 3 hours to kill. I found this old coloring book lying in the girls bathroom. If it were me now I WOULDN'T have touched it. But I did. I was only 8! I donít really remember all I did after that but I know that it was so boring because itís implanted to my brain. Is there ever a time when patience is fun? It's hard to imagine any situation where forced patience, especially as a child, could actually be enjoyable.
1238	19203	7	3	"Being patient is very difficult. I was at the store with my mom, and of course she was taking forever. ""Come on mom, let's go, do we really need this stuff?"" She just continued shopping. Grrr, I was so angry. I almost thought about throwing a fit. Finally, we were in line. As we got into the car my mom looked at me and said, ""Give me your phone."" ""But why?"" The way you acted in that store was horrible; now I know I will always be patient with my mom."
1239	19204	7	3	Every year I go to my dads. He lives in San Diego so we stop at the border. The border takes FOREVER! So my family has to be patient with them. On our way to San Diego one time the border was packed. Our family had to be patient, or there were going to be some argueing. With four kids it is bound to happen. After an hour every ones patients were running low, so my dad kept repeating keep patient, keep patient over and over. We finnaly past the boarder everyone cheerd. So keeping patience is not the easyiest thing to do. We all need to learn just a little more about how to keep it.
1240	19205	7	3	Are you a patient person? Well Iím not! Well, I can be patient I just wonít like to be. A few years ago my family got a gordon setter puppy. Since theyíre kind of rare in our town we had to go all the way out of state. A couple years later we bred her and ended up with seven outrageously cute puppies. The puppies crawled and barked within a matter of weeks. My dog had a tough time with them annoying her, but she lasted. Two particular puppies were trouble! Patience was needed to handle them. Itís hard to handle one puppy jumping in our pond and swimming across the deep end and another climbing chain link fences. We kept an eye on them constantly! They barked if you got them out of the water or off the top of the fence. The fence climber left our home first. I was so sad. When there was two puppies left (waterdog and his sister) they ran around the house like maniacs. My brother and I had to be patient with them. Then all of a sudden, they transformed into sweet little puppies. I didnít want to get rid of them, but we had to. Our puppies showed me patience always pays off no matter how hard the work is.
1241	19206	7	3	The bell had finally rang and it was time for lunch. It felt like math class would never end. I rushed to lunch without even stopping at my locker to grab my jacket. When I got there, there was a line for lunch that seemed like it stretched for a mile. I knew I was going to have to be patient. I got in the huge line, sighing quietly. I stood there and waited, shifting my weight from one foot to the other. Every minute felt like an hour, but I understood that it was a very busy lunch day, so I just waited. Several minutes later, I was near the front of the line, finally able to see the lunch options. All of the sudden, seven girls just cutted in front of the line because their friend let them. Even though that made me angry, I didnít complain and stayed patient, reminding myself it wasn't worth the drama. I soon got my lunch, a slice of pizza and a carton of milk. In conclusion, that was the time I was patient. I was understanding and did not complain, even when it was frustrating.
1242	19207	7	3	During the summer between forth and fifth grade, my family and I went to Six Flags Great America! Some of the rides had lines, but none of them had lines as long and the American Eagle. The line was huge! As my brothers, their best friend and I approached the American Eagle, I thought I would never get on. My dad said to just wait, but I didnít see the point. When I got about half way, one of the employees shouted, ì45 more minutes!î and I quickly became more excited. Eventually, I made to the front of the line! All I had to do was wait for the current trial was over! But then, the speaker came on, ìAll rides must stop until told to continue. A thunderstorm has rolled in and we must because of safety issues.î I had almost considered leaving, but had a feeling I shouldnít. I talked with some other kids I met in line. I played games like rocks, paper, scissors while I waited under the pavillion above the line. Once the storm rolled away, they allowed us on! The ride was a thrill! I had wind in my hair, a small mist from the rain, and a thankyou from my dad for keeping us in line. That day, patience certainly paid off, turning a potential disappointment into a memorable adventure.
1243	19208	7	3	The time I was patient as when I was getting my dog. I had gone to a jazz festival with my mom, my sister, and her friend. We were walking past a last chance rescue and we went to see the puppies. My mom didn’t want another dog but when she saw our future dog Boxter she gave in. He has grey fur with some black spots and a black line running down his forehead. At the center of the adoption event, he waited patiently. He was a grown short hair blue healer mix. We asked the lady if we could get him but she said they are going in sport and we could buy him there. We got in the car and drove anxiously to the location. We signed the forms and played with him in the store. But later we walked down town with him on the leash and we got some ice cream and went home.
1244	19209	7	3	A time when I was patient is when I had pink eye. I was patient because my family went on vaction to Myrtle Beach. The first night we got there my eye was starting to itch and became all red. So we decided the next morning that we would take me to the doctors office but there wasnít one around but we found an urgent care. So we went there. We waited in the waiting room. Finally the nurse called out my name. So we went into the room. We told her we needed eye drops for me. She said ok Iíll be right back. Then me and my mom and I were waiting and waiting for the nurse to come back. An hour went by and we were still waiting. I was getting really unpatient. Then finally she came back and told us that she was working on another patient and told us once again she will be right back and told us the doctor would be in there soon. We said ok. Once again two hours went by and we were still waiting. Finally the doctor came with us and told us he was gonna bring my prescription. Then yes he did come right back. Then my family and I left to go back to the hotel to gather our stuff to go to the campground. So that was a waste of three hours of my vaction. Even though it was difficult, I managed to remain patient throughout the long wait at the urgent care. Thatís a time where I was patient.
1245	19210	7	3	"I remember a time when I was patient. It was at my cousin's house. It was very boring though. I was also sad and lonely at the time, so I am going to tell you about it. It was not long ago, I was at my cousin's house. Everyone was there except me. There were not enough four-wheelers, so I was the only one left out. I felt so lonely. I couldn’t believe how bored I was. All I could do was watch with envy. Everyone was having fun except for me. Everyone was screaming with joy and laughing until they would cry because they were having so much fun. Then my dad came around a corner of the dunes for me. I smile to try to look like I am having fun, then he asks me if I want to go. I say yes! So I hop on the four-wheeler like there was no tomorrow. I knew it could just be a little while, and mainly thank you to my dad, and take off. I could not imagine how much fun this was. I felt the breeze hit my face, my shirt flapping on my back, it was amazing. ""I wish this day would never end!"" I said, screaming with joy. I had a lot of fun that day. I never had that much fun in my life. A lot can happen when you are patient. Even though I was bored at the beginning, it was worth it in the end; that was a time I was patient."
1246	19211	7	3	"Nana! Nana! Nana! Nana! @PERSON3 is hurt!"" I yelled. ""@CAPS1? How?"" ""@CAPS2 bleeding by the highway at the corner as the fence @PERSON1's with him."" ""@CAPS3 replied ""papa! Call @PERSON4 @CAPS4!"" nana yelled ""@CAPS5 get @PERSON1 and come inside!"" nana exclaimed. ""@LOCATION1, @CAPS6 we @CAPS7 leo!"" @LOCATION1, @CAPS6, nana, and popous carried @PERSON3 (Leo is a horse) to the car port and took a look at him. Hours later of trying to keep him warm @PERSON4 arrived. They got Leo on a talk. And started to bandage him up. They tried to get him to stand up but @CAPS11 wouldn't. @PERSON1 and I were wating in the house trying to wait and see if @CAPS11 was going to live. @PERSON1 decided that she was going to help out with her hourse. They carried the table with Leo on it to @CAPS8 his mom. @PERSON1 was behind @CAPS8 when she set the table down. And @CAPS8 kicks @PERSON1 to the tree. The next day @PERSON2 and I were putting a tent up in the back yard. So the horses could cool down. Nana called the vet to see @CAPS1 they could do. They got their @NUM1 minutes later they said that they will stich him up. And see @CAPS1 else they could do. They stitched him up for three hours. They said to watch him and see if any wounds would come out of their stitches. They also said they were going to check up on him the folowing @DATE2. That @DATE2 came and they took him to the statules and took care of him for a while @CAPS11 eventuly got belter. That's how I showed patince in the @DATE1. Ultimately, Leo's recovery demonstrated the importance of patience and care."
1247	19212	7	3	There has been many times I have been patient in my life before. But I think this one will interest you most. Finally we get to go to Aquatopia. Aquatopia is this big indoor water park in the Poconos, Pennsylvania. I have been wanting to go here for years. When we get there my first thought is “paradise,” little did I know that there were the biggest lines I have ever seen. And the lines were not just for the rides; they were for everything. In two days of fun it is already our last day at Aquatopia. So I wanted to ride all the rides one more time. My mom told me to go get my swimsuit on so we can go to the park. So I did. When we got to the park the shortest line I saw was probably an hour long. I was so disappointed I only got to go on, like, three rides. But I knew it was time to go and leave “paradise.” We left around 12:00 PM thinking we would be home by about 2:00 PM. And we were on our way back home. I was so bored it felt like it has been four hours but really it has only been one hour. It was taking us so long to get home because it was snowing really badly. I asked my mum when we were going to get home she said just be patient. So I just went along with it and sucked it up. “Finally we are home!” I say running inside. In my head I am thinking that was the longest ride ever. I look over at the clock it was 5:00 PM. Three hours longer then we thought. But I had to go to bed right then (darn it no video games). That is a time I displayed patience.
1248	19213	7	3	I believe that patience is a good characteristic in a person. Being patient is good because you have to wait without getting angry or frustrated. For example, if you were in on a ride, there would be a lot of people waiting in line for the ride; if you're patient, you would wait, but if you're not, you might leave the line and get out. People might like you more when you are patient. Impatient people get angry quickly and cannot wait, though waiting for things takes time, which is not nice. In conclusion, I believe that being patient is very important in life.
1249	19214	7	3	I have been patient a lot of times, but right now me and my friends are saving up to meet @PERSON1! That's a lot of patience just for one ticket, it's @MONEY1! So just imagine how long you have to wait to save that much money! It's hard being patient, especially when you are going to meet a celebrity that you have the hugest crush on! I have been patient a lot during this process of saving up money. No matter how hard it's going to be, I can do it with patience. My friends and I have been patient and still are. I mean, could you stay patient if you were going to meet your favorite celebrity that you love? Well, it's not that easy; first off, it takes a lot of patience to do chores and take care of your animals, plus count how much money you have. And when people borrow your money, that really sets you back. But like I said, no matter what, we are going to save up @MONEY1 plus tax to meet him, and we are going to be patient the whole time we save up. It is a lot of fun because you get to learn a few lessons, and you get to see and learn how to become patient. Overall, patience is everywhere, and you use patience in a lot of different things in life, so it's a valuable skill to develop and practice as we work towards our goal.
1250	19215	7	3	I had a friend well she is Amy's best friend and we know each other from first grade then in second grade she said she had to move to Florida. So she moved and she would call me all the like two time a week. I would always answer and talk to her for about three hours. I will always remember her. Until this one day came she called and I was kind of busy because there were people over are house. One of Amy's mom friend calls me and I told Lisa (Amy's best friend) hold on someone is calling me she said okay so I left the phone on Amy's bed while she was still o the phone. I went to the living room and Amy's moms friend said can you get me a glass of water and Amy's moms five other friends said the some thing. I went and got them water. After that Amy's mom said go take out the trash so I went and put on Amy's scarf and took at the trash out the like four mins I had her waiting. When I took out the trash Amy's best friend was and she said I can you stay outside with me and play for a little bit and I forget all about Lisa friend on the phone. I stayed outside for about ten min. then said I got to go back inside. I ment in and sat on the sof and Amy's moms friends that were over are house were talking and I sat with than talking laughing, playing, and watching t.v. After two hours and a half while I am watching t.v. I tell myself what am I forgetting. I knew I forget something, but I didnít know what so I get up and I walk around the whole telling myself what did I forget when I get to the room I was talking to Lisa in I seen the phone on the bed and I picked up and said I Amy Sarah Lisa I forgot about her. I said hello just to see if she was still there even if I had a feeling she didnít which did not. She told me you kept me waiting for the longest time ever. I told her wow your so patient I would never wait that long. She come on youíre Amy's best friend. I would wait forever for you so we continued talking, showing the strong bond that connected us despite the distance and the interruption.
1251	19216	7	3	Have you ever been patient? I know it is hard for me to be patient! I usually am not patient because I really like things done right then and there; I don’t really like to wait. I can be patient! I can be patient when I am waiting short periods of time. Usually I like to rush, not on my work, but socially, I rush! Being patient means to wait, usually without complaining or moaning. An example of patience is when you are going to a party at @TIME1 and it is @NUM1; you have to wait for a long time! Usually the time seems to go slow! Patience is a quality that is important, especially when things don't go our way immediately. That is why I am working hard to try to be patient, even when I'm eager for things to happen quickly. You should too! Cultivating patience can help us navigate life's inevitable delays and frustrations with greater ease and understanding.
1252	19217	7	3	Last year, December 25th it was my birthday, so I told my parents what I wanted for my birthday and out of everything I said ìparents I want a PS5î (PlayStation 5 station gaming console). So the next day we go out at three in the morning to get my PlayStation 5 and we were at Best Buy. So we walked up to the store and we opened the door and there had to be over 100 people in the store. So we walk over to the game. I she and their was two PS5 and their was five people in the section so we grabed one of the two. But when we got in line half of the people in the store were already in line. Then we waited in that stupid line forever it literally to us like hours to get through to the front of the line. We got home at 6:30 AM. This story is not about what I wanted its about patience. So I was patient for two and a half hours waiting to buy my PS5, werever you go use patience you will get thought about and treated nicer than you expect. Therefore, patience is a virtue that can lead to better outcomes and experiences.
1253	19219	7	3	One day my dad and I decided we would go fishing. He kept saying five more minutes, so I just sat there in the car, growing impatient. Finally I got out to find him asleep in his chair with a note saying 5 more min.
1254	19220	7	3	A time when I was patient is when I was at home watching my baby brother for my mama so she could go grocery shopping, and my brother was crying because he was sleepy and hungry. So I put him to bed, and I had to be patient because he was a baby, and my mama was gone for a long time. She had to do other stuff, like shop for clothes and shoes. When my brother woke up, he was crying, and I couldn't stop him from crying, but when my mama pulled up, he stopped crying and started laughing. That's a time when I was patient!

1256	19222	7	3	I am writing about a time when someone I knew was extremely patient. He was having to be patient with one thing: ME. When I was very young, once at a hotel pool, I had almost drowned. Since then I was afraid to swim. So, my patient friend taught ME how to swim at a pool in his trailer park. What he had to be patient about though was getting ME into the deep water of the pool. He wanted ME to go to the deep end of the pool but I was too afraid I would drown. So then he decided he needed to get ME into the deep end somehow. We got out of the pool and walked to the deep end. He just told ME to jump in, but he should’ve realized I wouldn’t just jump in. He did eventually get ME into the water of the deep end, but all I would do was hang onto the edge and not let go to swim or anything. So after that, I just got out and he began to get a little frustrated. He was patient though, and kept working with ME. After what seemed like hours, he pretended he was going to give up on ME. I told him if he stayed, I’d go in the deep end. So he did, and I jumped in and realized it wasn’t so bad after all. So now I love swimming, especially in the deep ends. That’s how my friend’s hard work and patience payed off for both ME, and him.
1257	19223	7	3	"It was the summer and I, John Smith, had applied for Harvard University. I had applied in April and was patiently waiting for a letter addressed to MR. JOHN SMITH from Admissions Office. From the beginning of the summer I had checked the mail box every day. Every day as I ran down the drive way I hoped that day would be the day the letter would come. I was afraid because two weeks of the summer had passed and still no letter. It was like waiting for that one moment at the climat of the movie when you think the main character will make his move. Friday was the first day in August and l was eating lunch. I thought to myself ""Today is the day it has to be."" I heard the sound of the mail truck pulling up to our mail bat and botted for the door. As I met the mail lady she smiled, everyday she sees me. Every day she sees my smile fade as I check the mail for that one letter address to MR. JOHN SMITH. She looks at me and says ""Today is that day."" Patience is a hard thing to get, but in the summer I had had my fair share of patience. It was a summer of anticipation and hope, and as the mail lady's words echoed in my ears, I knew my patience was finally about to be rewarded."
1258	19224	7	3	A time I was patient was when I really wanted a game called X-Men vs. Street Fighter Wolverine, and my mom said I had to wait until Christmas came strolling down the road. I can understand why she said that because we were a little short on cash at that time, so we had to make the rest of what we had last a little longer. After a few weeks had passed, I forgot all about the game; then on Christmas day, my sister and I got downstairs so fast. Then when we were opening gifts, I noticed a gift with my name on it. I go grab it, and I opened it, and it was X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom, and two other games that I wanted! After that, I go up to my room, grab my Playstation, and headphones, pop in X-Men vs. Street Fighter, and played it all day long, demonstrating the payoff of practicing patience.
1259	19225	7	3	One day, I had to be patient because I had asked my mother if I could go skate, but she told me to be patient, so we waited until she said yes. After waiting, we were mad because my mother had to go get the money for my sister. So always be patient, but if you do not be patient, you will not get your way. Like one day my sister Haven and I wanted to go to the movie with our friends, so we had to be patient for a whole hour because we had to wait until Mom got off of work so she could give Haven money and me money. Therefore, learning to wait and being patient ultimately helps you get what you want.
1260	19226	7	3	When my friend and I went to @ORGANIZATION1, it was very busy. We didn't have to wait a long time for entry, but @CAPS1 for my ride we did have to wait a longtime. To get on @CAPS1, my friend was very patient and I was not. I kept complaining about how long it took. @CAPS1 Eventually, we got on the ride and had a blast. It was horrible waiting, @CAPS1 but it was worth it because the ride was the @ORGANIZATION2. It's the best ride in the whole wide world, making the initial wait ultimately insignificant.
1261	19227	7	3	"Trying to write about a time I was patient is hard since I am not a patient person, but I am going to try. Three days before the trip to Cedar Point, I could not wait for it to arrive. I did try to make the time rush by, but it didn’t work. I had been off of school for @NUM1 weeks and had done everything I wanted to do. When my mom, sister, friends and I go, we always have a lot of fun (of course). Every night since I have known about Cedar Point, I would sit there and think that one day many kids would ask and complain to their mom saying, ""Can’t it come any sooner?"" But me? Never. I know that no one could make time go by faster. So I waited, did my chores, packed, and watched TV. Trust me, it was very long, very boring, and itching at me to complain, but I didn’t. I took a deep breath every time this urge would come, reminding myself it was only a little wait compared to other things. I would also think about how lucky I am to be going to Cedar Point. I know I am a very impatient person, and I am trying to fix it. This is what I try to do while waiting for Cedar Point to come along. This is what patience is to me, and a time in my life when I was patient, even if it was difficult."
1262	19228	7	3	Being patient is hard! Well, especially when I have a baby cousin coming from [City Name] and she was adopted from California, so I have never seen her before. I have only seen her in videos and photos. So, I have heard her voice on my phone before; she sounds so cute, and I’m missing my aunt and uncle too. I haven’t seen them in [Number] years. But I'm still being patient, waiting for them to come tomorrow or today. It’s a surprise! I'm being so impatient. It's difficult to wait when you're excited about meeting someone new and seeing loved ones after so long, but I'm trying my best to be patient.
1263	19229	7	3	It was a cool November 12th 6:30 AM. The sun was just coming up as I got into my box blind. It had snowed the night before but it was only November 11th. Then again I was in the upper penisaala of Michigan. I was hunting for a monster ten point with my brand new 30-06 and high power gun could kill a dear 300 yards. I have been sitting for an hour but it felt like a day. Iíve only seen a squarile and he was fun to watch in all but not the rush you get when you see a deer. ìGobble, Gobble!î I was looking in the direction the sound was coming. ìGobble, Gobble!î gun up quick time my adrenilen hicking in. ìGobble, Gobble!î I see move ment put my scope on it and I see it. Itís a itís a grouse? I glowered the gun calmed down and watched it eat some corn. It was 12:00 time for lunch and all I had was a turkey sandwhich, a apple, and a bottle of water. I started with my apple eating slowly while looking around when I  saw a brown figure move. I grabed my gun with my apple in my mouth. So picture quick time a guy with all come on. An apple in his mouth, and look in a scope. As I looked  I realized it was him the big ten point. Massive horns, a big body and he was proble five maby six years old. I put my crosshairs just be hind the shoulder and I diehed the safety off. Slowly pulled the trigger. My mind a blur and ìBoom!î perfect shot. Later quick time I found him and he was big 250 pounds. I got him mounted and thatís were he is now. The trophy serves as a constant reminder of that thrilling day in the Michigan woods.
1264	19230	7	3	I was patience when I had to wait in line for @NUM1 hours just to ride the rollercoaster. Then I got on, it took off @NUM2 miles per hour. I was stuck to it for five minutes then it went down a steep hill @NUM2 miles per hour. I got off and rode it miles cum force and I was faced to it. The drop is intense. The ride was @NUM1 minutes long with @NUM5 people. I went on the powa hour it was sence. My reaction was the reply it was fun to. I came home as it was in the @TIME1. I woke up and ate breakfast. The whole time is waied patience in everyone, making the day a memorable experience.
1265	19231	7	3	The time when I was patient I was about seven because I was in second grade, im twelve now but back to what I was sayin, I was sayin that I was seven in the second grade and I was standing in the lunch line and these kids just kept on cuttin me in line jus for some lunch and I just sat there, being patient and myself. But I just stood there so when we did something else I was patient; when we got up there I was ok it was ok ëcause I still got to eat. So, even though it was frustrating, I managed to get through it without getting upset.
1266	19232	7	3	One day when I was patient is when I was waiting for @CAPS1 JOHN @NUM1 23 to come out of GameStop. One day til @CAPS1 JOHN @NUM1 23 come out I kept looking at the signs of the game and I said ì@CAPS2 CALL OF DUTY must be a good gameî. So instead of waiting at GameStop I went home and played @ORGANIZATION1 MADDEN football @NUM3 24 on my Xbox @NUM4 SERIES X then I got tired, tired and more tired so I fell asleep on my pep game chair till the morning. My older brother woke up and said ìlets go to GameStop to get @CAPS1 JOHNî. So we went to GameStop and waited in a long line for like an hour and thirty minutes til in was are turn to buy @CAPS1 JOHN it cost like @MONEY2 60. I had @MONEY3 30 my brother had @MONEY1 30 he didnít wanna put no money in for the game and I said ìIíll pay @MONEY3 30 and you will @MONEY1 30î. So we brought the game and played it tell we beat it, enjoying the experience together.
1267	19233	7	3	is a way that I had to be patient, and we all know that **everyone** has to be patient with others. **It's a skill we all need to learn.** Yes, it was my birthday. I wasn’t thinking of my birthday party, my cake or ice cream, no I was thinking of getting the money, first present no money. Second present, yes, there was money. And so on until I got to the last present. It was a card so it had to have money in it. I couldnít wait until I could buy something with it. How does being patient the into this, well I had to wait, and wait, and wait. It took nearly five whole months! Could you believe **having to wait** so much there **that I wanted**, and have to wait that long? Well, anyways it payed off. When I finaly got it I couldnít believe it. It was the best thing in the whole world. That is why being patient is very hard to do, if its along time, but its also a good thing to do because it pays with every time. Ultimately, the reward that comes from waiting makes the difficult process worthwhile.
1268	19234	7	3	Tick, tock, tick, tock. Every muscle in my body urged me to run and look for my dad. Tick, tock, tick, tock. But I stayed put, my eyes scanning the crowds. Tick, tock, tick, tock. And then I saw him. Tick, tock, tick, tock. I ran forward and gave him a giant hug. The clock in my head stopped ticking. Hi @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 gonna tell you about a time I was patient. I think that I was really patient when I got back from a trip, with my friend to @LOCATION1. I was waiting at the airport for my dad to come and pick me up and I was so excited! You see I had been gone for two weeks and I was really homesick. It took everything I had to not go looking for him, but I knew I couldn’t just go running off, I had to be very patient. In the end it was worth it because it would have been harder to find him if I had went looking for him. As you can see, I think I was very patient when waiting for my dad in the airport. Thank you for listening.
1269	19236	7	3	It was the @NUM1 12th of @DATE1 July we were on the plane about to go on a cruise, when we got to the ship I was so excited I was thinking how much fun I was gonna have, think what my room would look like, and going to all these cool new places. So we got on the dock and there was a line and I was patient and waited to get on. @CAPS1 AND there was another line to check your passport, so I was patient and waited. @CAPS1 THEN there was another sticken line. It was to get our room keys, but I was patient and waited again and just stood there for a little bit and it was done, but wait you would never guess, there was another line. So like all the other lines I stood there on my iPod listening to music. They my dad said ìreadyî, I said ready for what another line he said ìnoî to look at your ìroom and relax .ì I was so excited. Finally we where done with the lines no more for a white. So I open my door with my very special key that we had to wait in line for and looked at my room it was amazing. But the bath room was a little small but it was great. I was so happy to final done with the lines no more! That is a time when I was patient, even though it involved a lot of waiting.
1270	19237	7	3	One time I was going to see my friend that lived at the end of the street. I walked there, taking in the scene of the sun going down and the young ones playing and laughing carelessly. A new boarder waved at me but I didn't trust him enough to wave back since he seemed like a weird o, not to be mean or anything. I finally got there and knocked on the door. She answered about thirty seconds afterward ''oh, hi Amy!'' she exclaimed and smiled kindly. ''I have to finish my homework and eat.'' I nodded. So I went to wait in the park. I sat on the swing and swang back and forth. An hour went by. I patiently sat there. I didn't know if she was coming out and decided maybe I should go home. It was getting dark. When I got up she was outside. I told her I had to go home because it was late I could come back tomorrow, though. That was a time I was patient.
1271	19238	7	3	One time, I was very patient when our flight got delayed. We were going to Hawaii that time when all of a sudden the delayed sign came up on the monitor. I was kind of sad but I said I had to be patient! Our flight was delayed by hours. So when we were waiting we did a lot of things! First we went to eat in the food court! We decided to go to Chili's. We also had to wait for our food! Got some good nachos & they were very good! Then we went to the gift shop! At the gift shop I got three key chains for my friends! Then I got myself two magazines & a reading book! I also got some peanut M&Ms! They were very good! Next we just took a little walk around the airport! Then we went and sat down & relaxed for couple hours. Then I fell asleep! when I woke up we were just about ready to board! I was very excited to finally get to Hawaii & enjoy all of the tropical weather! I learned that being patient really does matter! That was the Time I was really patient.
1272	19239	7	3	Being patient! Patience is a good learning skill. The three steps to being patient are being quiet, not complaining, and waiting a while if you have to. My mom and I went hunting with @PERSON1, my step dad. We had to be quiet so a deer could come. We sat there being quiet. I think it was the quietest I've been ever! All of us were getting sick of being quiet but we had to be in order for a buck could come. It was very cold and I was dressed warm but I was still cold. There was a little heater in the shead thing we were in. we couldn't complain being cold or tired, or just waiting, so we all sat there not complaining that was good. When I was about to ask if we could go in a ten pointer came out of the woods to find something to eat. We were waiting patiently for the deer to come closer. @PERSON1 loaded the gun and pulled the trigger. The buck jumped and ran off. Perfect shot! We got out of the shead and searched for a blood trial. We had to wait a while to find the deer but it was worth it. The right way to be patient is shutting your mouth, not wining and waiting. A good skill to learn is being patient, and learning to be patient makes difficult situations more manageable, which is why it is such a valuable asset.
1273	19240	7	3	Being patient is a very hard thing for me but one day I learned my lesson. It was a Saturday and my mom waked me up at 8:00 AM she say we had a lot to do. When we got in the car I didn’t know that I was going to have to be patient the whole day. First on our way to the local market we got stuck in a traffic jam for about 45 mins to an hour. When we finally made it to the local market we had to stand in line for about 30 mins. I told my mum I’m ready to leave but she said I have to be patient and that being inpatient is a bad thing. After we left there we had to take my grandma to the doctors it took them almost two hours just to call her name, then it take another hour to get checked out. After that we went shopping for some clothes and shoes and the mall was very crowded and busy. We were at the mall for like four hours and most of the time we were standing in lines. Finally, we went home because it was time for my mom to start cooking. I learned that I need to work on being patient because it is a part of life.
1274	19241	7	3	At one point in life you would have to be patient. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerate. Somebody thatís patient experiences difficulties without complaining. There was one time in life when I was patient. Yay! Yag! My mom is taking my friends and I to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I called many friends, and told them if they wanted to go. Meanwhile, we packed up some water bottles and hopped into the can. We were all looking out the window. OMG! Look at those big roller coasters. One of my friends shouted out. There we were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2; the first ride I saw was the @CAPS3. The highest and fastest roller coaster there well, it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. So we were all talking about it, then we decided to go on it. Wow! The line is huge. We all said. I shouted out its ok, I heard its an awesome ride lets just all be patient. Meanwhile, we waited and waited, until we were finally the next people to ride. We went on the ride, and then all of a sudden the ride start, we didnít know and it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. We waited about two hours but it was worth it. In conclusion, I really do think that being patient is a good thing in life, even if it takes hours. I learned so much from just going on the @LOCATION1, we should all be patient because no matter where you are, you will always need to be patient.
1275	19242	7	3	"I remember one time I was impatient, it was when my mom called and said she was going to send me $50. I asked her when she was to send it and she said next week. Today was Tuesday, so that meant I had to wait 5 days. The next day came and the mail truck came by and I thought I had money but it wasn't next week yet. I said, “Oh man.” Wednesday came, I was still waiting so I tried going to the park to let the day pass by ""quickly""! So, it was Thursday they had my favorite game on sale ""The Bully,"" the case had a yellow sticker that said $10 and no tax at all. I was mad and sadly went home. My dad woke me up and said “it’s next week!” I rose up, ate breakfast and checked the mail, it was bills, bills, bills and “my money!” my mom sent it in an envelope. At last I said I have money, so I bought some ice cream and I bought my favorite game “Bully.” That’s the time when I learned the value of patience and how waiting can lead to a satisfying reward."
1276	19243	7	3	Patience in basketball: Understanding and being tolerant is what makes up patience. In order to play on any sport team, you have to have patience. I say that because you might not always get the pass or score the point but you are still important to the team, your time will come. A time when I was patient was when I was on the basketball court. It was during our game; the Carman girls basketball team was going against Flushing. A young lady from Flushing got fouled (I didn’t even see it, truth be told I’m not even sure if it happened but you can’t argue with the officials) she was shooting her free throws. She was taking forever! I’m surprised her shot wasn’t took. What was she waiting for? New sneakers? I didn’t say anything. I just stood nice and patient! Eventually the girl shot (air ball, brick) she didn’t make either of them. Anyhow, I was so proud of myself ,I felt really happy for myself. I’m just now realizing that, that whole time I was standing there I didn’t make a face, or say anything or think something in my head! I was just standing tall for the first shot minding my own business and untelling to see if it would go in. Then on the second shot (you can now bar out) I just assumed the box out position. Sit down, butt down hands out and face the basket. I was really happy for myself and I even told the girl good shot. Hence, it pays off to be patient. One, I got the rebound and my teammate got the point and I also got an assist. Two, I was displaying the right way to act to the opposite team! Nobody’s perfect, you’ll have to wait and see who will score the next point! This experience taught me that demonstrating patience ultimately benefits both myself and my team.
1277	19244	7	3	"It was my first game. I was pumped, ready to go in, coach yelled ""big guy"" and I was by his side, helmet in hand. Then he said next play you're going in. Then the assistant said no, I wasn’t allowed to. The whole time I didn’t complain. I never said one word to anyone, not even a frustrated sigh. I helped other people get their equipment right. It was still fun to be part of the team. The whole time at least I didn’t complain and make it worse for everyone else. The whole time I was on the sidelines, bouncing on my toes, eager. Never went in not once. I was very patient, perhaps too patient. Not to say I wasn’t mad; disappointment simmered beneath the surface. At least I got some exercise standing there, shifting my weight and trying to stay loose. The whole time I supported my teammates, shouting encouragement and offering high fives. I helped in any way shape or form, handing out water and towels. I listened to them complain about missed blocks or tough opponents, but I did give support and positive feedback. There I was, so mad I could have screamed. I was ready, I felt ready, but my coach said no. It was my time to shine, or so I thought. That one stupid word stood in my way: no. But at least I learned something about perseverance and team spirit, even when facing personal disappointment."
1278	19245	7	3	Hunting when you are turkey hunting you need to be extremely still and quiet; you have to have a lot of patience. If you move even a muscle, all the turkeys will run away. Sometimes you will be sitting for hours and hours just waiting on the one shot. I remember when I was hunting with my dad, sitting under a tree for probably three hours, and finally a turkey came. Unfortunately, just about when I had a shot, my dad scared them all away, but I still had the patience to stay out there for another two hours, hoping another one would appear. That experience, enduring boredom and disappointment while maintaining focus, is my example of patience.
1279	19246	7	3	One day, two years ago I was going to visit the @ORGANIZATION1 train. @CAPS1 was a @NUM1 hour wait. Once we got to the front of the line we had to go back to the end because my mom forgot the tickets, so we had to wait 21/@NUM1 hours to get to the beginning. Once we got there, the guy told us that we could have told him our name and he could have found our tickets online. My mom got really mad, but we got to go on the @ORGANIZATION1 train which was really fun. That's the time I had to @CAPS2 patient for over @NUM3 hours, standing in extreme heat, a truly testing experience for us all.
1280	19247	7	3	In my opinion, being patient is when you're waiting your turn for something. And being impatient means not waiting your turn. In your whole life, you have patience because sometimes you might just have to wait. I have patience, and I know a lot of people who have patience too. I was raised to have patience when you're doing something; don't rush because you can mess up. Don't go way too slow because then people will think you don't know how to do it. You can just go at your pace so you can get it done right and the way you want to, finding a comfortable middle ground. People who don't have patience aren't always happy all the time, as they might struggle with frustration more often. Therefore, cultivating patience is vital for navigating life's challenges with greater ease and contentment.
1281	19248	7	3	Have you ever had to be patient before? I have and this story will tell you all about it. Last year on my birthday my uncle promised me a phone but I had to wait for him to get the money. I had to be patient. So I waited and then December finally came, more months passed and I still hadn’t heard from my uncle. I began to become frustrated with him because he promised me that phone. I told my mom and she said he has always been like that and to keep my patience so what if he got it a little late. I was thinking in my head A little it’s been almost a year! Then on November 23rd my uncle came over for my family reunion. Then he told me he knows that I thought he forgot about the phone. I knew he was right but just then a little light bulb went off in my head he couldn’t have forgotten about. Soon it was time to eat and that is when he presented the iPhone touch to me. I was so excited I just had to jump up and give a hug. He told me that whenever he promised me something he would test my patience to see if the wait was worth waiting and in this case it was, and he wanted to teach me a valuable lesson. So whenever your patience is being tested keep your cool it will all come to you soon. To conclude this story I want to say patience is important to have because without it you will never be able to wait for anything in life. The End.
1282	19249	7	3	I will say that you are board very fast. Most people are cause when you get out in the woods theres nothing you can do except watch and waist if you make one noise you will see nothing your whole hunt. Hunting is all about patients but it is a great reward when that doe, buck or whatever youíre hunting is rite in your sight. There are sometimes that I have been impatient and thereís times that I have been patient when I was younger I was very important I would got up and walk around but when I got older I got more patient like when. I got my first deer it was an eight point. Hunting @MONTH1 take patients but I like it and its fun, even though it requires a lot of waiting and quiet observation, the thrill of the successful hunt makes it worthwhile.
1283	19250	7	3	One time I was patient was when I had to get some HOMEWORK done and my mom was on the computer. I needed the computer for my HOMEWORK. She told me she would be only a few minutes. So I waited, I decided to watch an episode of Spongebob while I waited. As the episode ended I went back to the computer. She still wasn’t done! So I made some bagel bites which are pizza on a mini bagel. I ate 1… and so on I got to 6 and I started getting full. But I kept eating. I ate and ate. I was really hungry. I finally got stuffed, so I decided to stop. I went to check to see if mom was finally done yet, but yet she wasn’t. I went outside to go play some sports with my friends. We were out there for about 2 HOURS. We got tired and eventually we all went home. As I walked in the door I looked at the computer it was still in use. I went to go take a bath because baths are soothing. I took a while in there because it was so warm and soothing. I got out. I went upstairs to change. I came downstairs and surprisingly my mom was off! I went to get on but she came in and said time for bed, so I woke up early to do my HOMEWORK. This took a lot of patience because it was hard to wait so long. In the end, waiting for my turn on the computer demanded a significant amount of patience from me.
1284	19251	7	3	One time I was in patient. We was an are way to see the point. The had family was with us. We all was in @NUM1 car and vans. I was like and the van @NUM2 and the car and @NUM3 in the car. It was like a @NUM3 hour drive. I was in the car with my mom and @NUM1 sister. We was and takere for like a hour. First I was on the fane then I was just having a family talk bye like an hour I was so in patient. And all I could here was my mom like be patient we gone get there. Iím like no no I want to be there @CAPS1. She like we got all day. Then we stop to get something to eat, stretching our legs before continuing our journey. Then we was there, finally reaching our destination.
1285	19253	7	3	One time I had to use patience when we were driving to Disney World. It was in a minivan with my mom, dad, baby sister (6 months), and my aunt. We were in the van for about 2 to 3 hours. By the time we got to the hotel it was 7 o'clock PM Disney time and, in California it was 4 or 5 am. I was very tired of being patient, I'm not a very patient person so my mom was very proud on how great I did with the baby crying and being stuck in one place for hours. It was very difficult but the outcome was great!
1286	19254	7	3	"Being patient is hard. I hate waiting. For things, days to come up, mail or packages, people, anything. Patience requires effort that I don't have. I really have never been patient. I don't know many people who are, either. There is my mom who ""claims"" to be patient; she is not! I think one of the least favorite phrases is ""be patient""! I tense up and get frustrated when I am impatient! When I am waiting to call someone I am tempted to call them a hundred times. I am patient when I want to be (which is never), when I want to be and when I don't realize if I will be impatient in about three seconds because I am done with the writing page and time isn't up yet. It's a constant struggle, and it feels like a virtue that's simply out of reach, leading to frustration in many everyday situations."
1287	19255	7	3	When I was @NUM1 yrs old my mom started making my @DATE1 present. She was going to make a blanket. Sadly she didnít find the blanket. I have to be patient. I had birthdays and it wasnít done, then Christmases. My @DATE1 was almost @NUM2 months ago and still nothing. She hasn't found a time to sew that she can find peace in @NUM3. I have been patient and every year on my @DATE1 and on @CAPS1 I ask if it is finished but I’m not. I suppose I can be patient for alittle while longer; hopefully, someday the blanket will finally be finished.
1288	19256	7	3	"One time when I was patient was when I was fishing. We were fishing on a cold night and no fish were biting. I was just out ther being patient eating sunflower seeds. My dad was getting mad, and I was still listening to the backyard Celtics games. We were only catching little fish that night, nothing to eat or keep. We left at like one in the morning and went to get the boat on the trailer, and it was pitch black and cold. I eventually had to get in the water and put the boat on and strap it down. On the way home, one bent trailer tire popped ahead five miles away from home. I was still patient, but my dad wasn't. We stopped and went out to look at the tire. We didn’t have a spare, so we drove home on our rim. That is the most patient I have ever been. To improve this writing sample, she could have explained what a millennium is, which would make things more clear. Also, she could stop using ""I"" to start most of her sentences, that would make it more interesting. In the third sentence, she put ""where"" instead of ""was"". That would make her sound smarter and get a better grade. In the second paragraph, I don't know if she meant 1:00 a.m. or 1:00 p.m. If she specified whether it was a.m. or p.m., it would make the story more clear. If she corrected all those errors, this would be a good sample, ultimately making the narrative stronger and more effective."
1289	19257	7	3	When I was patient, I was sitting at a restaurant. I ordered my drink, and Mike was the first one served. Then, when we got our food order in, they said it would take about five more minutes, so I sat there. It was fifteen minutes later when she came back and made the wrong food, so I was losing my patience. So then, I just relaxed. She came back with my meal, and this time it was the right one, so I was very happy. And I was really hungry, so I ate it very fast. When I was done, they gave me a free discount because of the mix-up they had with my meal. And my mom bought me something from a store for such great patience I had. And that's when I was very patient, showing that sometimes, patience is rewarded.
1290	19258	7	3	We were going to Cedar Point. Me and my cousins were so excited! We were waiting to ride the skyline. After we ate, me, my cousins, and my sisters headed for the skyline. The skyline gave you the whole view of Cedar Point. ìIím so excitedî said one of my sisters. ìYaa me too!î said the other. We were walking towards it. It took really long. When we saw the line we gasped! ìThis will take so longî said my sister. I was so surprised my 8-year-old cousin heard us. ìWow it look really highî said my cousin. ìDonít worry, we have Mom with us. Sheíll take care of usî said my younger sister. Finally it was our turn. There were two small kids behind us, wanting to go on so badly. ìWhy donít you go aheadî said my cousin. I was shocked my cousin had so much patience. Usually sheíd start wanting to go first for everything! I was so proud of my cousin. We had a great time there. I hope we come back again! It was a truly memorable experience for all of us.
1291	19259	7	3	"Patience is a hard thing to have, but there are rewards to having it. I had a teacher that no one could ever remember to give us our report cards in band class. So after a few weeks I made a bet with him that if he didn’t bring us our report cards the next day he owed me a bag of Ruffles. Weeks went by, then months went by, until finally it was the end of the year. And he still didn’t have them. Once school started up again, and we were halfway through the school year, my band teacher walks in and gives me two packs of Skittles. I then remembered the deal we had made and said, ""I was only supposed to get one!"" and he told me, ""The second one is for being so patient."" This small act shows that even in unexpected ways, patience can indeed lead to greater rewards than initially anticipated."
1292	19260	7	3	Patience is a valuable thing. Everyday I go to basketball practice to watch all my friends play. I do rehab practice because a few weeks ago, I broke my ankle playing soccer. It takes patience to sit in a gym and watch your friends have fun for an hour and a half. Every Tuesday and Thursday I sit on the bench and watch the team play a basketball game. I have the choice to not go to the games, but I have patience. So I go. It is very boring to just sit there but I do it so I can watch and play next year. You know now that patience is a virtue. It takes lots of patience to do really anything. Do you have patience? Patience isn’t when you're sitting somewhere for a while and get upset with someone. It is when you are calm and waiting, and being able to accept the situation and make the best of it, proving that patience is indeed a virtue.
1293	19261	7	3	The one time when I was paitent was on the @CAPS1 test of last year. Some of the reasons how I was paicent was by keeping to myself or as you know it being quiet. The @CAPS1 is not that hard but when you have to have paitence thats when it gets hard to you, and me. Pacents is key because you will have to use it for a long time! But lets get back on track shall we. On the @CAPS1 when you are done you have to wait for your class mates to be done. So in that spare time you can read a book or check over your work. Pacents is also important because when you taking the @CAPS1 you cant rush on it. You have to take your time and know that you are timed. Thats where pacents comes in! Sometimes when you are done with the @CAPS1 you can just sit there and think about what you did today the reason I say this is because of other people! If everyone in the classroom donít have pacents you are most likly to fail the @CAPS1. You have to have a silent and quiet room! Now if every body in the room and is being silent than you can and will do good. When I have the @CAPS1 I @CAPS8 pacent when I am done because I care about other peoples work habbits with the @CAPS1. I understand that you donít have the @CAPS1 no more but it is being pacient! When I get my test results back this year in seventh grade I hope I did good because my classmates and I all had pacients! And rember pacents is the key thing to sucsses! In conclusion, I learned that day that being considerate and understanding of others during important moments, like taking the @CAPS1, significantly contributes to a positive and successful environment for everyone.
1294	19262	7	3	"One day at school, @PERSON2 was waiting in line to get his lunch when out of the blue, @NUM1 kids popped right in front of him. @PERSON1 said to the kid that they had to go to the back of the line. ""We don't,"" said the kid. Then a few minutes later, a girl named @PERSON4 (that @PERSON2 likes) was going to the back of the line, but @PERSON2 said she could cut in front of him, so she did. Once @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 got up to where they got their food and were waiting to pay for it, the kid @NUM2 spots away from @PERSON4 couldn't remember his student number to figure out that he was a new student, so they had to make him a student number; then he paid for his food. Finally, they got through, and @PERSON4 sat down with her friends, but @PERSON3 didn't have anywhere to sit because his friends were outside. So @PERSON4 saw him and asked if he wanted to sit with her, so he did. Finally, he was done, and @PERSON4 asked if @PERSON1 wanted to hang out at recess, and he said sure, but one of her friends was not done eating, so they had to wait for her. When she was done, they went outside; this was what @PERSON1 was waiting for, but the bell rang to go inside. He was mad, but he got to hang out with @PERSON4 the whole time, making the school day memorable."
1295	19263	7	3	Last @DATE1, while I was up at my family's cabin, my step dad taught my brothers, friends and I how to waterski. It being the dareful activity that it is, I tried first. Using all the steps my step dad told me to, and being patient with myself, I got prepared in the water. Out of the blue [literally, we were on a lake] I got up on my skis just like @CAPS1! Now I could make all sorts of turns! When the waterskiing session came to an end, I brought my boat up to the cabin. I insisted she try waterskiing. But when we got out to the lake, and I had skied a few times, it was up to her to decide if she was going to try skiing for sure. We sat there for what seemed like an hour waiting for her decision. But, in the end, she decided not to try. I was very proud that day because I didn't try to persuade or push him into trying it. I was very patient with her. And although her decision was the wrong one in my opinion, I am still proud of myself to this day for what I did on that boat; I respected her choice.
1296	19264	7	3	"When I was 6 years old my mom used to be impatient all the time and got so annoyed at things! But then one day she was going to take a shower, but then people kept on going in before her, and she got patient for a while, and I got up there. I saw her and hid. As I peeked from end to end, she was still standing there, almost falling asleep, and she was still patient. Another stepped in the bathroom, and I quickly went there and said, ""Hey, excuse me, but my mom is coming; she's been waiting."" So I woke up my mom: ""Mom, Mom, wake up; go take a shower!"" and she woke up and took a shower; after she came out, ""Ahh, it kind of feels good, that was better."" The end. This little act of patience helped her, and it also taught me something about looking out for others."
1297	19265	7	3	"When I was about seven and my mom was pregnant with my second sister, it was the night before she had her. We were all asleep when my mom started to scream. We all went into her room. My dad asked her what was going on. She said, ""She's coming!"" My dad raced to the car, put it into gear, and left without us and my mom, who was about to have a baby. Then, when my dad realized he forgot us, he felt terrible. So when he got home to pick us up, it was already morning. They took us to a room and prepared my mom. Me and my little sister were waiting in the seats next to her. Then when they took her to get an ultrasound, we had to wait. It was finally time to deliver her. Me and my sister and grandma had to wait outside the delivering room. We were so patient. It took over an hour to get her out. When they were stitching my mom up, they brought my little sister to get all cleaned up. When we could see her through the window, I had to see her get her first bath, shots, and when they put those patches on her, I had thought she was an ANGEL. But when they brought her to our room, my mom looked dead, and my NEW baby sister was so beautiful. My mom said she was so proud of us being so patient waiting for our little sister. My mom said she would name her Ashley, and we all liked that name. I was so HAPPY that day, a memory I'll always cherish."
1298	19266	7	3	"Patience is something not very many people have. I am in between, I can be patient at times, BUT at other times I'm not. To be patient is to be understanding and tolerant. It also means you can go through tough times without complaining. Every year I'm not that patient, and every year we go to Mackinac. We go to Mackinac for labor day, to walk the bridge. The rule is, if you don't complain you get fudge. I thought I wasn't gonna get fudge, because I had pulled muscles in both my legs and the night before embers burnt my legs. I knew that to get fudge I had to be patient. So I got dressed, walked to the bridge, and gathered up all my confidence and patience and started the mighty walk. Every year we try and beat our bridge walking time and I thought my legs would slow us down. So I told myself ""be patient"" over and over and then I sped up going past the first three miles in 40 minutes, (because my legs were worn out). I knew to beat our record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I thought we could and my legs felt like THEY were ready to burst! I couldn't do it anymore. I knew I had to stop and complain, BUT my legs kept telling me ""KEEP GOING!"" THEY wouldn't let me stop, THEY were: tolerating the pain and being patient. I also had to be patient if I wanted fudge. So I cranked up the speed and sped to the finish line not only to get fudge, BUT also to beat our record. Thanks to patience I got delicious fudge and we beat our record. That's a time I'll never forget, because I had patience and I kept going until I crossed the finish line. That's how I was patient, and I'm glad I was patient with my legs. I'm not very patient so thank goodness for patience, because it allowed me to achieve something I didn't think I could."
1299	19267	7	3	"Being patient is all about being tolerant and understanding. Sometimes when I'm in a bad mood I have to be patient when someone asks me a dumb question or gets on my nerves. One day (last year) I was feeling sick and upset it was during vacation and my little sister wanted some ice cream, but not from the ice cream tank that rode by every twenty minutes from the ice-cream shop which was about seven to ten blocks away. I was bundled in my blanket when she jumped on my bed. ""I I I I want to go get ice-cream. , , !!!"" I said in a mean voice. ""You little hobgoblin get off my bed OR I'LL YOU!!!"" I was younger and in a terrible mood that crying sound so silly and stupid. Tears came to her eyes and I didn’t realize at that moment that she was little (four years old) and didn’t quite understand that I didn’t feel good. I apologized and explained that I was sick. Immediately after she ran out of the room and ten minutes later came back with a hot cup of tea and said ""I made mama make you some tea"". That was heart warming to me. After I drank it she asked if I felt better. I said a little then she got on my bed and started bouncing. I was patient with her and knew that she didn’t fully understand yet. So I got up and took her to the ice-cream shop to get some ice-cream. She was happy and that made me happy. I felt extremely proud that I was patient with her even when she got on me nerves. I know I wasn’t patient with her at the ""beginning"" but at the end I was, and that small act of patience created a more positive outcome for both of us."
1300	19268	7	3	It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and we were up @ORGANIZATION1. We all wanted to go on the boat and go tubeing. We ventured out to the boat and got all ready to go, we tried to start the boat but there was nothing. My @CAPS1 and cousin took the back of the seats off and peered in the back, there was boat-loads of water, the bilge pump had stopped working. My step-dad took a look at them and said that it was going to be re-wired. He had soon re-wired the boat and it still hadn’t worked; all the kids were now getting antsy. Every adult said we needed to have patience. Everybody had now calmed down and walked away. Pretty soon we heard a boat start up that sounded like my @CAPS1’s; we ran down there with excitement and sure enough it was started, we hopped in and there we went tubing down the river. Later that day my mom had said to me “patience is a virtue,” and that day I learned to appreciate the value of waiting for things to work out.
1301	19270	7	3	Iím constantly patient mostly because of my younger sister. Sometimes its easier than others to be patient with her, but most of the time Iím able to manage. I think this is a great example. One chilly @DATE1 morning @TIME1 I was in my mothers room and I saw her doing her make-up. I asked ì@CAPS1 How did you get @CAPS5 so good at putting make-up?î @CAPS2 She responded ìwith patience and years of practice.î The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom ì@CAPS3 Hey mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1, Sephora later?î @CAPS2 she replies ì@CAPS4 Really, why?@CAPS9 Why do you ask?î I answered ì@CAPS5 So I can get some make-up to practice withî. ì@CAPS6 Okay.î @CAPS2 She says. When we get there, thereíre @CAPS5 so many choices to chose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones! After we check out; its time to go home and practice! Sadly my first lesson in make-up didnít go to great, but I did ask my mom for some help and @CAPS2 she said ì@CAPS8 Just keep practicing, I know youíll catch on soon!î and I wondered out loud ì@CAPS9 Why?,í @CAPS2 almost said as a whisper ìbecause anyone can pay someone else to do their make-up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patients to learn it their self.î This experience taught me that patience is key to mastering new skills.
1302	19271	7	3	When my wife and I got into the checkout line at Kroger, everyone heard impatient groans and signs around us. Almost every line was extremely long and the whole store was packed. I groaned along with everybody else, annoyed at the long wait. My wife continued her cheerful whistling, and didn’t seem to notice. “Honey this is going to take forever!” I whined. “Don’t be so negative. It’s not that long.” She replied. She saw my responding glare and chuckled. “How about we play a game?” We continued a game of eye spy for ten minutes or so as the line slowly progressed. After we finished our game, she continued to make small talk, and then checked her list to make sure we had everything while I played a game on her phone. Soon we were up next and I smiled in relief, and thought to myself it was a good thing my wife kept us occupied! As we walked out of the store my wife said, “See, when you’re patient, you get food!” We both laughed and drove home. It was a good reminder that a little patience can make even the most tedious tasks bearable.
1303	19272	7	3	Every year me and my entire family take a trip to Florida to the Myrtle Beach beach. Everyone in my family that goes is me, my mom and my dad, my little sister, my three cousins, my aunt and uncle and my grandparents. We all stay in one big hotel together, which usually has five bedrooms. Out of the whole year we only stay for two weeks. So I have to be very patient the other three hundred and fifty one days. While we are there we fish for sharks and sting rays, hang out on the beach and swim in the ocean or the pool. So it is absolutely worth the wait. I always have a great time and now I wait patiently for next year.
1304	19273	7	3	I remember it all clear as glass ice. It was two summers ago when my mom, two brothers, and I went to Cedar point. The car ride was about an hour and a half, maybe two hours. I was really excited about going on the new ride at Cedar point- the Steel Vengeance. With nothing to do but listen to music and stare out the window, this car ride was turning into forever. Of course, once we got there we still had to go on lots of other rides. We usually start at the front and work back, doing things in order. This I didn't mind since we went on mostly big rollar coasters with a few acceptions for rides like Mine Ride, Dodgem, Scrambler, Troika, and Planet Snoopy. My mind was kept plenty distracted from the maverick with how mad, fun I was having at the time. Unfortunately, it became harder to keep my patience once we got to the Steel Vengeance since the line was nearly an hour and a half long. I guess that the line was to be expected considering that it was a new ride. After waiting for so long we finally got to ride it. The Steel Vengeance was amazingly epic. Finally, all of my patience had payed off, and I had a great day.
1305	19274	7	3	"One day my mama said she was going to take my little sister to the dentist, and my sister was so happy about it. My mama also had other errands to run. First, we went to Costland Mall to get me a homecoming dress. After that, we had to go to Shoe Depot to get me some shoes. Third, I went to get my hair done. Finally, we were on our way home, but I reminded my mama that my little sister had to go to the dentist. When we got to the dentist's office, we had to wait about 30 minutes. I told my little sister, ""Wow, this whole day you have been so patient; I couldn't have done that,"" because all the running around would have made me impatient, so I was really impressed with her calm demeanor."
1306	19275	7	3	Why wasnít my uncle there yet? Come on! I was saying there I hade a trapped bet up my back, falop used into the ground and the only thingi had to call for help with was my cell phone. Where was uncle @PERSON1 @CAPS1 all I quick Iíll look back to see what was wrong: I was at uncles house waiting for him to hurry up so could go hunting. I doulnít wait. Opening the back door very quite and crept out with my @NUM1. Guage, I then ran out into woods ans into my tree stand. We had had this stad for as long I could remember. That I now see ñ was a bad thing. The ladder was old and we felt like it would break. The top bowed and break quite a few time in different spot. We kept telling ourselves that we would rebuild it but we never got to it. So after climbing up the ladder I let the gun to my side and waited. Hunting required a lot of patience but I didnít need any. There standing on the horizon of tree, was the biggest buck I had ever seen, I almost said it was so beautiful. Loading a stud into the barrel I took aim and Boom I shoti zzz+++! I missed luck! The stud tilted to the side. I reached for the gun so I could put it on safe sown and even the edge. The gun landed bend me I turned even to see the stud coming down. I turned so I was facing the ground and tried to get up but I had spined my leg.Then with agreat crash!!! The stud fell into my lap were trapped beneath my back I tried to move but my back hurt too bad and my legs were starting to bleed.i was luck I didnít break my neck and so my problem esd I wasnít patient at first. But I learned my lesson and wanted andwas patient enough to wait until my uncle was within yelling distance. I got in trouble, and learned the hard way to be patient, ultimately understanding that sometimes the best things come to those who wait, even when faced with the immediate desire for action.
1307	19276	7	3	So one day in fifth grade I was running around playing tag on the playground when - push! - I got pushed off the slide. I fell and broke my arm, so it went crooked and I was in pain. So I went to the doctor's and waited for two hours, and I just sat patiently by not moving my arm at all, watching other people walk in and out. Finally, they called my name. They told me my arm was broken but they could not put a cast on there, so we went to the other doctor across the road, waited 30 minutes, and got a blue cast. About a month later, I got it taken off, went back to the x-ray room, but then they said I had to cast it up again; this time I got pink, and eventually, I got it taken off, and that’s the time I was patient throughout the whole process.
1308	19277	7	3	The time I was patient was when I went to the FBI Academy. My dad went there and he did a bunch of training, he was there for like three months. At the end if they made it through they got a award. So there was kind of a lot of people. We had to dress really nice. We had to sit through all the people getting awards that we didnt even know. The worst part was they gave speeches. Then after what seemed like hours my dad got up! I was so happy he got his award! Then we got to leave. That was the time I had to be patient, but seeing my dad get recognized made it worth the wait.
1309	19278	7	3	"Go! @CAPS5 coach yelled. @CAPS5 soccer team and I were running sprints to get warmed up for our game today. @CAPS5 day was planned, first soccer then @CAPS5 friends birthday party. I could hardly wait. That's when I felt a rain drop pound down on @CAPS5 head. Before I knew it I felt another, and another, and another! Suddenly it had started pouring. @CAPS5 team and I rushed under a nearby awning. @CAPS2! The thunder nearly shook the ground. Finally the refs come over and announced, ""the game has been delayed."" I signed and slouched down on a picnik table. I knew now I would @CAPS7 to be patient if I wanted to get through today. There we sat under the awning as rain slamed down on the root and thunder cracked."" @CAPS1 would I make it to @CAPS5 party now?"" I through. @CAPS2! @CAPS2! @CAPS2! More thunder came. It had to go @NUM1 minutes without thunder for the game to resume. Before I knew it we were already on minute @NUM2. Even the slightest bit of thunder and we would need to start back at @NUM3. We were now at minute @NUM4. We listened closely until we hear a @CAPS2! From far north frustrated I say ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 mon!"" @CAPS5 team began to count the minutes again. Finally after the longest @NUM1 minutes of @CAPS5 life there was no sign of thunder or rain. The game was back on! @CAPS5 team and I sprinted on to the field. We played our hardest that game but, sadly we lost @NUM6. We walked off the field with our white socks and jersys splattered. With mud. Every one of us were sopping wet. @CAPS5 mom gave me the ""@CAPS6 up"" look and I quickly ran to the car."" I will still make it to @CAPS5 party but, I will be just a few minutes late and I @CAPS7 to change in the car."" I said to @CAPS5 self. As I sprinted through the wet grass I heard @CAPS5 coach yell from behind me, ""@CAPS7 fun at your party @PERSON1, and @CAPS8 for being so patient!"" I smiled and replied ""@CAPS8 coach!"" That day I realized being patient is a good quality to @CAPS7. Many people appricite it when you are understaning and don't complian during difficult times."
1310	19280	7	3	On the way back home from a doctor's appointment, I was getting annoyed about being stuck in the car. I did not want Mom to get annoyed more. So I tried great to be patient. Once a while I would play with the seat belt. About 15 minutes have passed and I was getting more impatient. But I still kept control. Once I got home I went to bed and relaxed, finally able to unwind after the tiring trip.
1311	19281	7	3	A time I had to be patient was when my dad was waiting to get the money for our chihuahua. It was July 14th and my dad sold his guitar to his uncle to get money for the dog. Of course, his uncle didn’t have it. A day went by and still nothing. When my mom came and picked him up, I went to swim practice trying to be patient and wait for my dad to get the money. At around 6 o'clock my dad called saying he wouldn’t get the money till July 17th at 3pm! I was mad, but still tried to be patient. A few days went by and soon it was July 17th again. I was so excited. We finally got Sparky! I had been patiently waiting for a week and was tired of it. So when I saw him my patience was worth it. That was the time I had to be patient for something good. It had really paid off.
1312	19282	7	3	Being patience is what you need to get anything done in the world. One example is school how do you use patience. A way is being understanding to your teacher because they’re there to help you to teach you for life. Sometimes teachers may explain concepts in a way that's hard to grasp, but patience allows you to ask clarifying questions and truly learn. If you don’t be patient and understand your teacher you will get nowhere in life. Another example is with your parents. You need to be tolerant with them; they were tolerant with you when you were learning to walk or talk. If you don’t have patience with you parents and don’t listen to them then you won’t learn all the life lessons they give you, without their skills you will get nowhere in life. Therefore, patience is essential for navigating relationships and learning, paving the way for a more successful future.
1313	19283	7	3	Once I knew a girl whose name was Ashley and met another girl named Sarah. They had been inseparable until high school. Ashley had gotten many more friends and started becoming very popular. Sarah called Ashley everyday to see how she was and or if she wanted to hangout. Ashley kept lying to Sarah saying she was busy and always said lies and blowing her off. But one day Ashley had a very bad day, and when she tried to tell her new friends about it and apologized for how she was acting, they were unsympathetic. Ashley had learned that Sarah really was a true friend and was patient with Ashley through the bad times. This shows that if you are truly patient only good things can come, and genuine friendships will ultimately endure.
1314	19285	7	3	"One time I got in trouble for getting a bad grade on my report card and my mom said I was grounded. I asked her how long I would be grounded. So I went upstairs to read a book. An hour later I came down and asked, ""How long am I grounded?"" She said, ""I don't know how many times do I have to ask you to tell."" So I was bugging her all day. She said, ""I am running out of patience."" I said, ""Can you just tell me?"" She said okay. She pulled out a sheet of paper. I said, ""What is that?"" She said, ""I counted how many times you asked me. Twelve times, 'yikes!'"" My mom said twelve days and that is final. I said okay. I think I learned a lesson today: don't bug your mom all day, and definitely do better in school!"
1315	19286	7	3	One sunny beautiful day I went out and was driving my quad around and all of a sudden my mom yelled at me and said she was going to go get my new good in TOWN MALL, BEST BUY, and she said I couldn’t go ANYWHERE. I sat down waiting, waiting, waiting and waiting. Then I decided to play playstation 4 (CALL OF DUTY, GTA 5) ANYWHERE. I was playing for two hours straight, and then I decided to go watch MISSION impossible (TOM CRUISE) . After that was over I went back to play playstation 4 (p.s.4), again. I played it for another hour. Then all of a sudden I hear beep, beep, ANYWHERE. I look out the window, and it was my mom. TOWN MALL ma. Then we talked bout the new quad and then I hear beep, beep and it was my mom. my mom. new BIKE!. Then I ran out took it out and rode it for like 3 hours straight. That is how I had patient for about 4 to 5 hours long. I was proud of myself after I was done riding my new BIKE.
1316	19287	7	3	I was patient when I was in a doctor's or dentist appointment to wait in the waiting room. Some teachers say wait a minute because teachers are talking to someone else. When I have any test, a teacher says don't open it so I always have been patient. When someone tells me to wait, I listen. I also be patient when I'm waiting for the buses, airplanes, trains to come. I'm patient when I'm bored to wait sometimes. That's how I've been patient, showing patience in various situations.
1317	19289	7	3	I am going to tell you all about a time when I had to use patience. I had to use patience when I was waiting for my friend to fix my Xbox @NUM1. My friend was taking forever when he tried to fix the Xbox. All I did was sit in a chair and watch him tinker with the device. He finally got the Xbox fixed after about seven or eight hours of intense work. Once me and my friend began to play the game, it broke again. So then we had to take the game to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and have them look at it. I had to have patience because if I didn’t, I would have been really bored just sitting around waiting. Once @CAPS1 @CAPS4 looked at the system, they told us that they would have to take it and then look at it in detail. It took @CAPS1 @CAPS4 almost four days to fix the system and return it to me, so I had to have patience so the system could be delivered back. Patience is a very needed thing in life. Now you know all about a time in my life when I had to have patience. It was definitely a test of my ability to remain calm and wait, highlighting just how valuable patience can be in everyday situations.
1318	19290	7	3	"""This is awful,"" said my little brother. This line is taking forever. ""This is the last time we are coming on this ride."" The ride that we were on was Space Mountain at Disney land in California. As we got into line at the ride there was a sign that said I have and 90 min wait from this point. It was hot and it felt like I was walking miles. The line would not go any faster. My older brother was happy for some reason. No one could understand we were standing in line in 90 degree weather. I was being as patient as I could be I just stood in line wishing, hoping to myself we could get on the ride. The first hour went by and another sign came up 1 hour from this point. We all got mad. The walkway sounded silent. I know that everyone could hear a pin drop as a drop or someone's sweat hit the ground. Everyone being patient. Finally we waited 3 hours to go on just one ride. That was the first time I was that patient, and it taught me the importance of enduring even when things are difficult."
1319	19291	7	3	One time when I was patient was when I was in the car going up north to @LOCATION1. I was in the car for eight hours; my cousin @PERSON1 was driving, and my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was in the seat next to her. I was in the backseat with their dog, @CAPS3. My cousin @PERSON1 was talking the whole way there. I tried asking to stop and go to the bathroom and get food, but they both said no, so I waited and waited. An hour passed, so I tried asking again; I got the same answer. That's when I tested my patience.
1320	19292	7	3	"One sunny afternoon I was so excited because I was going to see my favorite band. When I'm in school! My mom picked me up from third grade. I was so excited it was time to go. My dad dropped my brother off at my grandma's house (he was only a toddler so he could not go.) I was bouncing off my seat ""Mom are we there yet?"" I asked. ""We have two more hours to where we are there, then another hour, so we are going to see the place here,"" Mom said. ""Mom, can I have my d.v.d please?"" I sighed. So now it has been two hours I've been in the car. Then we went everywhere my mom and dad wanted to go not where I wanted to. Then it was time to go see The Wiggles! When we arrived I was a little sleepy but that would not stop me. When they only played two songs I wanted to sleep on the seat. I waited all day to see them and I went to sleep. That was a time I was patient to see my favorite band, even though the concert wasn't exactly what I expected."
1321	19293	7	3	I remember the time when I had to be so patient, it wasnít even funny. I had to be patient to get my new cell phone. My mom told me I was going to get one when the school year started. I waited and waited until the school year started but my mom told I would have to wait another week because she didnít have the money from all the school supply shopping she had done. So I waited another week. I was so excited when I remembered that my parents plan a trip to Disneyland that weekend, so I had to wait another week. It was on the following September 15th when I was at my cousinís house and my mom came in and surprised me with my new phone and I was so happy that I finally got it. So I guess you can get cool things when you are patient.
1322	19294	7	3	One christmas about a year or two ago we drove up to my grandparents house. They live in Coldwater so it took about 4 hours. All my relatives on my dads side were there. All the presents were under the tree and I couldn`t wait to open them. The parents were just talking about nonsense, so I opened my big mouth and said “can we open presents now?” We started to open the presents but the adults had to go first. They are the slowest gift openers ever; I was about to rip the presents out of their hands and open the presents myself. I didn’t do that though because I was being patient. After they finished I said, “yes!” Of course, my little cousins had to open next. Let me tell you, they aren’t fast at all either. After that I finally got to open my presents. In the end it was worth it; I got an x-box Series X, and over $100. That was the time I was patient, and it definitely paid off in the end.
1323	19295	7	3	Patient is a very hard thing to do in life. Itís one of those things that is so impossible for people to do some times, even for little kids. You can tell when someone being patient is when there being polite and waiting their turn without complaining about it . Sometimes people donít like being patient I know I donít lik to a lot. People who are not patient tend to often be not tuned to others wait. But people who are pacient they sometimes tend to be anoying or quiet donít talk very much even when they do talk they stop talking when people inturupt them. And they defiantly donít yell or shout out at all. Itís a good thing to have patiencets because you will grow up with an understanding good family, good friends and a peaceful mind .So in conclusion that;s why itís good to be patient.
1324	19296	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to the bookstore and I wanted a book. I was at the bookstore and I wanted a book called Taylor Swift Back at the School as a school girl, and my mom said if you are patient then yes. I was so happy because she knows I love Taylor Swift books and her life. As soon as I got it I started reading it. My mom said thank you for being patient, and I said you're welcome, thank you for buying it. I had told my mom that if we could go to the bookstore and she said not today, and I kept on asking and she said not, and I kept on asking and she said maybe. So I waited in the car, listening to the radio, and we went to the mall. There was a bookstore in the mall and I asked if I could look around. My mom said yes and told me to find the book that I wanted. I found it and she bought it. This is a time I was patient. One thing I learned is to be patient if you want something and don't keep asking, because waiting can sometimes lead to getting what you want in the end.
1325	19297	7	3	I am patient when I go hunting. I know that at any moment, the buck of a lifetime could walk out within shooting range. And if one does, I will be ready. The first time I shot a deer was with my bow. And I remember sitting there, being as patient as I could, waiting for a deer to step within range. Then I heard the leaves crunching. Then there it was, the deer I'm going to shoot. How do I draw it back? Then I shoot; I could feel the arrow gliding through my bow. Then the arrow hits the deer with a thud, and the deer takes off. I waited there in my tree stand, ready to go claim my deer. Me and my dad tracked it for about an hour, and there it was. I was so excited that I yelled. It was nice to know that all my patience and hard work had paid off, making the experience all the more rewarding. Thank you for reading my story; I hope you enjoyed it.
1326	19298	7	3	Patience it take a lot to have patience. One time my sister was trying to hate me but I didnít let her get to me I have patience I get made so Iím watching tv she standing the task can you move off infront of the tv and she moved she sat by me and keep on touch me it didnít bother me at all she asked me over and over Iím you I said I going to antil I make made I said so you donít bother me at get out my face I really get mad so she tried her best by trying to ripup my home work so I said I donít care she had a smart comment whatever and I keep watching tv so I was so patient with her she said im go make mad so I ignored her she got mad and kept saying do you hear me I just walked outside and and said to myself I cant go let her get to me we mite end up fighting I went back in the house and sat down and I told her you cant make me mad so you might wonít to stop so she said girl whatever and I was so ready to say something but I wasnít go give her nothing to feed off. Ultimately, I was able to maintain my composure, proving that her attempts to provoke me were unsuccessful.
1327	19300	7	3	"My mom was patient when she didn't get her money that day. She wanted it to come, but it didn't, so she was mad for a minute, but the next day it came. I said, ""I told you, Mommy, it was coming today!"" Did she get her money? Yes. Did she... You told her to wait one day, but she didn't know where her money was or when it would come. She was patient by not calling the people and asking them where her money was and things like that. The next day she had the money. There was nobody at home then, so we went to the mall that month. They had the money, and everybody was happy—me and my brothers and sisters. This showed great restraint and patience on her part, and the reward was a happy trip to the mall."
1328	19301	7	3	I remember when I went to @LOCATION1 to visit my step-grandmother for @CAPS1 and went fishing. I didnít really want to do it because I am a very impatient person. The creek we were going to fish in was right behind her house. I grabbed a fishing rod and went into the ëbackyardí. I flung my fishing line into the water and waited. After maybe @NUM1 minutes or nothing (except my sister who caught most things,) the line finally started to unravel. Excited, I leaped out of my seat, knocking it over, and grabbed the reel. Twisting and twisting the handle for what seemed like forever, I brought it up. The fish was small compared to what my sister caught seconds later. My step-grandmother threw the fish back. After another @NUM1 minutes I became frustrated and went to swim. After an hour of swimming, I went back to my rod and decided to be more patient. I waited until my line started moving and I got up, and twisted the reel faster than before. Iíd caught the biggest fish of the day. I sat down and waited an entire hour for my line to move. I then caught another fish. Happy, I dropped my rod and told my step-grandmother. My patience lead up to me catching the biggest fish of the day and learning something new.

An example of being patient is lets say your standing in line for @NUM1 hours to get tickets to see your favorite band play. Now waiting @NUM1 hours in line is being patient to get the tickets, while not complaining or anything. Being patient is very respectful to yourself and others around you, and it shows consideration. But I also think that everyone could use a little patience, as it can improve daily interactions. I think that people should think about patience more often and its positive effects. If everyone in the world didnt have patience the world would be a crazy mess. Example: @CAPS1 one would be waiting these too. Everyone would waiting be first. It could just be crazy. So Iím happy that there is patience in this world and people have it, which makes life more manageable for everyone.
1330	19303	7	3	"I was patient when I had a doctor's appointment. Me and my mom had been waiting almost an hour for them to call me. Twenty minutes later the nurse calls me. She says, ""Sorry for your wait. Thank you for being patient."" Then after that, my mom took me to get something to eat, so we were waiting @NUM1 minutes later they give us our food from the drive-through, saying, ""Sorry, thanks for being patient."" It seems my patience was appreciated in both situations."
1331	19304	7	3	This is a story about what patience means to me. Patience is when you have a problem and you don't complain about it. For example, I had to give my mom @NUM1, but I did not have the @NUM1 write then and there my mom did not complain she waited she had patience. Patience does not mean you keep beging. It means that you are understanding and tolerant. If your dad said he is going to give you some pizza, have patience and wait on that pizza. When you have patience people will have patience with you. For example if you was waching tv and you did not want to get up yet people will have patience and wait for you to get up. Patience does not mean you keep asking. For example I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 beging my mom for candy not knowing if I had patience a waited on her answer I would get the candy, but I didn't. This is my story and what patience means to me, and why I believe it is important.
1332	19305	7	3	A person I know that is patient was my old teacher named @PERSON1. He was a very patient man although we got on his nerves. If we didn’t understand a question that he explained a million times he was still patient. Even when we got attitudes with @PERSON1 he was still a patient man. I think @PERSON1 was determined to be patient with us as he must of prayed because he was always patient with us through thick and thin. @PERSON1 was the most patient teacher and person I’ve ever known.
1333	19306	7	3	Patience, what's the first word that comes to your mind when you hear that word? Waiting? I know that's the main word in my mind. Here is a story when I was very patient. Every kid dreads meap testing; it was on November 14th and we had to be completely silent. It's hard enough to be quiet. But it's harder when you're next to your friends, and you're a girl. We had to do meap writing, writing is the worst for me. But when I was done, I felt really good and quiet for everyone else. That's the story when I had to be patient, and it taught me the value of silence and focus in challenging situations.
1334	19307	7	3	Patient can be a very hard thing for me to have at times. For example, when I go to restaurants and we wait for our food, I get bored very easily. One time when I had a sore ankle from an injury in soccer, a couple months later, it still hurt in the same spot. My mom set up an appointment with my doctor. When I did go to the doctor, she felt for a lump or fracture in my ankle and said “I don’t think there is anything wrong, but we won’t be sure.” She sent my mom and me to the urgent care out on Highway 1 with a note that said I needed an x-ray. After about a twenty-five-minute car ride, we were there. When the kind lady checked us in, we waited in the x-ray waiting room. My mom texted my sister saying we would be a while because the urgent care was busy that day. I had to have patience because we were waiting there for a whole hour! Clearly, this was a time I had to have patience because I was already nervous about a possible broken ankle, and the waiting just made the anxiety worse.
1335	19308	7	3	Being patient is a wonderful thing to be. Here is example of me being patient for my birthday. My birthday was coming and I was extremly happy. I would always backtrack of my days so I had a personal calendar for counting down to it. After that I made lots of birthday lists. I went to stores to see what they had. For an example, I saw this beautiful short that had a matching belt. @NUM1 days before my birthday I would not eat. I also went to @LOCATION1 and check out all the wonderful cakes. The day came and we went shopping for all the stuff I wanted. I conclude that my anticipation, planning, and delayed gratification all demonstrate I was patient.
1336	19310	7	3	A time I was patient was when I had to be patient for having a difficult task without any help. Not one complaint came from me. It was so hard, especially with the strict time constraint. I had one hour to finish it, but realistically, I needed three hours to finish. It was so hard that not even a college student could finish it. @ORGANIZATION1's match test was the hardest I had ever done. I took deep breaths and focused on each problem, even though I knew I wouldn't complete them all. Remaining calm and collected allowed me to perform as best as possible under immense pressure, ultimately making the experience a testament to my patience.
1337	19311	7	3	ìMom, how much longer.î I complained at the airport, ìWe have been waiting for about two hours now.î ìIt will only be a couple more minutes sweety.î replied my Mom in a stern voice. ìIt better take only a few minutes because I really want to go to Disney world.î I complained again. As you might know now, We are in an airport full of people. We had to wait for six hours before our flight took off for Orlando. It took a lot of patience that I thought I never had. In the first hour of waiting, I was really really bored. I had nothing to play with besides my gameboy Advance. The gameboy Advance is a boxy looking object that folds open. There is a screen on the top and controls on the bottom half. That was my only fun that I could use to keep me busy and not fall asleep. I was very bored. But thankfully I found a T.V. that they had at the airport. We went over to the lounge to watch, but the only channel we could watch was the news. I did not like watching the news at all so I played my gameboy. I played that for about an hour. I hadn’t said anything to my Mom the past two hours or three hours. I didn’t want to bug her so I left her alone. When the next hour passed, we boarded our plane finally. We waited a total of 6 hours and 15 minutes. It was a painful but memoriable experience. When We boarded the plane and found our seats my Mom said to my brother and me that she was very proud of our patience. To this day I realize why my Mom and dad don’t like to fly to places any more.
1338	19312	7	3	"@CAPS11 was Saturday. @CAPS11 was almost time for @CAPS1 birthday. @PERSON1 was going to be six years old. He was helping his @CAPS6 made his birthday cake. After they were done making the cake mix, @CAPS1 @CAPS6 put @CAPS11 on into a cake pan. She put the pan into the oven for @NUM1 hours. I can't wait for my super yummy chocolate birthday cake to be done!' said @PERSON1. A 'few minutes later @PERSON1 asked if his cake was ready. '@CAPS3 @PERSON1 said @PERSON1 @CAPS6, '@CAPS4've still got about @NUM2 hours and @NUM3 minutes until your cake's done"" ""@CAPS5 that @CAPS4'll take forever"" whined @PERSON1 ""You've got to use your patience @PERSON1 "" she said."" @CAPS6 what's patience?"" @PERSON1 asked ""patience is waiting for something without complaining @CAPS11"" explained @PERSON1 @CAPS6. ""@CAPS7 you can do something while the time passes by faster. Like play a game, ride your bike, play with your friends, or play in the sandbox."" "" @CAPS8, "" said @PERSON1, "" I 'll go do something else.' @CAPS9 @PERSON1 went downstairs to play his video games. When he was done playing his video games, he checked the oven to see how much time has gone by. There were two hour and thirty minutes left. @CAPS9 @PERSON1 decided to go out and ride his bike. He put on his helmet and got on his two wheeler bicycle. He went for a ride on the neighborhood trails. He saw his friends and joined them on their bike ride. After their bike ride @PERSON1 asked if them if they want to go play in the sandbox. They all said yes. @CAPS9 they went to the backyard and played in the sandbox. @PERSON1 and his friends all made this huge sand kingdom. @CAPS11 had big castles and @CAPS11 had a trench all around @CAPS11. @CAPS11 took up the entire sandbox. @PERSON1 went inside to ask how much time was left on the oven."" @CAPS6 how much time is on the oven?"" asked @PERSON1 "" Only five more minutes ,"" said his @CAPS6, "" you should take that time to brush off all that sand. I see you and your friends are covered in @CAPS11. And when your done you can invite them in for a piece of cake. When @PERSON1 and his friends were done getting the sand off of them they all went inside and had a piece of cake. After everyone finished their cake they all said,"" @CAPS11's the best cake ever!"" It truly was a great birthday, and everyone enjoyed the delicious cake."
1339	19313	7	3	ìPumped on, Mom!î I yelled. We had just gotten our tickets for my favorite amusement park in the world; Cedar Point. ìCalm down, @PERSON1,î my Mom told me. ìIím comingî, she said. Iím not usually super hyper, but I just love roller coasters. Itís also nice to just take a day off and pump up to Cedar Point. I live in Ohio, so the drive isnít that short. My Mom had just finished giving the man our tickets. ìHave a good day at Cedar Point,î he told us. ìAlright, @PERSON1, what do you want to ride first?î my Mom asked me. ìHow about the Iron Dragon?î I asked my Mom ìWhy not?î she replied. By the way if you didnít know my name is @PERSON1. But thatís not important right now. Whatís important is getting on the Iron Dragon. My Mom and I waited in the line for about an hour. It seemed to take a while, but before I knew it, we were buckling up. Now I know the Iron Dragon isnít the biggest ride, but itís still pretty big. The Millennium Force is, I was a little nervous. Everyone gets nervous before their first ride, and as we were going uphill, everything started to get smaller, and I started to get more nervous. The Iron Dragon ended up being a blast! After the Iron Dragon we rode the mantis, the Raptor, the wicked Twister, GateKeeper, the Valravn, The mean streak, the Pipe Scream, Dodgem, Skyhawk and the maXair. ìAlright right @PERSON1, pick the last ride,î my Mom said because that was easy. We still hadnít gone on my favorite ride yet. ìLetís go on the Millennium force,î I said. We got in line. The sign said the wait was two and a half hours. Because,  Iíve been on the ride, and itís definitely worth it. The wait ended up being a bit longer. The wait was four hours, and I wanted to leave after three. I waited, though, and even though I thought it wouldnít be worth it, I waited. It was totally worth it. The waiting was terrible, but it was worth it. I really enjoyed my day at Cedar Point, and Iím glad I waited for the best ride, making the whole trip a memorable experience.

1341	19315	7	3	I am going to write a story about patience. Patience is when you wait for somebody to do something. One example of this might be if someone else is fixing something for you and you really want them to be finished so you can move on with your life, but it is the type of thing that takes time, maybe a lot of time, but if you want it done right, you will have to wait. Sometimes it will not be a person you wait for, but an inanimate object, like a television show, which can not be rushed, even though sometimes you want to rush it. With a human however, if you rush them to do something, it might end up being not as good and even breaking in about ten seconds after them doing it, but it might end up happening faster though. You might also wait for nature too, such as a sunny day, when it might have been raining for over a week. You also might be waiting for the power to come back on during a storm. I, for me, have really wanted the power to come back on during a storm because there is nothing to do! Patience is also about waiting for your boredom to pass, like when you are just stuck inside and there is nothing to do. It is hard to wait in moments like those, but it is a necessary skill to practice. So, patience involves waiting in many different situations, and practicing it is ultimately important.
1342	19316	7	3	One time when I was patient was when I broke my thumb. I was patient because I wasn't complaining about it or crying. Really wasn't doing anything because I didn't think it was even broken, and it wasn't really bothering me. Then I went to the doctor and got it checked. The doctor didn't think it was broken because I almost beat him in a thumb wrestle, but he x-rayed it just in case. When he came back with the x-rays, he said it was broken; he was very surprised, I was surprised, everyone was. So, I think my calm demeanor during the whole ordeal really showed how patient I could be.
1343	19317	7	3	This past @DATE1, my family and I went to @CAPS1. When were in Flagstaff we were going to the??? It was basically a big ski slope. When we went to the top on???. I was scared that I??? going to fall. When we got to the top I could see Flagstaff and sort of the??? . I got dizzy and I didn’t like heights, I started to throw up. I was happy to get in line to go down. When I got down I felt better and then I yet like I was going to throw up again. ??? I love my mom and??? That day was the worst day of my life. I was happy the next day when we went to the @ORGANIZATION1.
1344	19318	7	3	
1345	19319	7	3	Once when I was patient when we went to green bay and it took @NUM1 hours ever to get in to our Hotel and when it was finally the time we got in the Hotel and it was @NUM2 p.m. there time which was which is @NUM3 p.m. our time and I was a little upset. The next day we went to toy r us and my sister was mad and my mother wanted to get a van and we tried a whited van and me my bro and dad like the white one but my mom and stupid sister didn't like like the white dodge van and we tried the silver van and my mom and dum stupid sister loved it but me my bro and dad hated it oh and we got the dum silver van and it took @NUM4 hours to get the du van and it was stupid going home. The Car ride home was still a little bit tense from the van disagreement.
1346	19320	7	3	Patience is the way to being a only winner? Patience is waiting a while for something, as well as controlling your emotions. IF you wait a long time without getting mad on reading out, you are what people call patient. If your kept up this habbit, your will have a good life that is full of positive outcomes and better relationships.
1347	19321	7	3	The first time I learned patience was when I was little. My mom said she would buy me a Playmobil set. I wanted it so bad, but I had to wait to get it, so I did and I waited and waited and waited. Then I figured it's been a whole month and nothing happened. I just was so mad, but I didn’t do anything. So, we went to Walmart, and she bought me a Playmobil set. I was so happy. Later, I asked for an Xbox (still seven). My mom said wait. I waited for three months, but still nothing. Four months nothing, five months nothing. I was just so angry, but a whole year passed, and I got it. It was awesome. I got my own room, and finally, I got an Xbox. Getting older is awesome, especially when patience pays off in the end.
1348	19322	7	3	"Oh I have a great story about patience! One day, I was at my grandma's and grandpa's house. There was my two brothers, my little sister, my grandma and grandpa, and myself present. My grandpa was ready to serve up ice cream. All of a sudden, my brothers and sister started yelling, ""I'm going first, I'm going first!"" ""Lathan?"" my grandpa asked. I responded by saying, ""I'm not being a part of this!"" I thought to myself, how long is this going to go on since this was all getting me a little freaky. I said, ""Kids! Get in line!"" They were like ok. So, patiently, everyone got in line and took their turn choosing what kind of ice cream they wanted. And what a choice we had: vanilla, strawberry, mint, or cookie dough ice cream. Everyone settled down and enjoyed their ice cream cone, proving that a little patience made the treat all the sweeter."
1349	19323	7	3	I was patient when I was going to the doctors to get checked up. I didn’t complain about it. I had to wait for @NUM1 hours. Then when I went in they took a couple of weights; it took about @NUM2 hour. Then they take some tests then at the end I finally went home. That was the time I was patient.
1350	19324	7	3	One time I was going hunting. We got to the woods @NUM1 5:00 or earlier. When we got there we found a spot to sit on the ground. We were goin to stay in the woods till dark or we kill our limit of deer. When it was or @NUM2 1 Ω hour till dark we seen a dow but when we moved the gun to shoot it it ran. We stade not moving or talkin waitin. Then more deer came. But they were really small so we let them go. When their was like @NUM3 15 minutes left till dark a good size dow came. It was to far away tho so we waited for it to get closer the boom the rifle goes off. It dropped but it was still alive laying down. We waited like @NUM4 10 or more minutes then it died. That was one of the times I was patient.
1351	19326	7	3	There are many ways to be patient, like while you are waiting in the lunch line or when you line up to leave the room. Here's a time when I was patient. It was time for this trip to go skating, and I was talking to some friends. I wanted to go right away, but I did not say it because I knew I had to be patient. Then we got there, and I wanted to get in and skate, but they had to tell us the rules, so I said nothing. Then we walked in to skate, but it was a long line for skates. I did not push or shove my way through; I waited patiently. Then I skated and ate, then left. Being patient that day allowed me to enjoy skating without stressing myself or others, which shows @CAPS1 how we can be patient in different situations.
1352	19327	7	3	Patience, can you be patient? Some people are and some are not. Sometimes I cannot. Well here is a story about patience. One time at school in the lunch line, it was long. It would barely move. I wanted lunch so bad I was not being patient. But for some reason my friend was being patient. I said to her why are you so patient? She said because everyone is going to be able to get something to eat. I said yeah that is true. So I tried to be patient, reminding myself her words were right, and before I knew it I was sitting by my friends talking and eating my food. In the end, her patience rubbed off on me and made the wait much easier.
1353	19328	7	3	I was so bored but I knew it would pay off. I was on a flight to Rome, and it took hours. In that haven, I went to the bathroom, ate lunch, played with my phone. I slept and then, still later, I finally saw it when there so nearly done.
1354	19329	7	3	I was patient in gym class today for my skill test; I did great and got @NUM1 out of @NUM1. We have @NUM3 bells in my class, so it was quite the wait; also, when it was my turn, it took half a minute to do it. We wasted all half of the class on the skill test, and I was waiting to play dodge-ball the whole time. It stinks because we didn't get to play dodge-ball. So, I pretty much wasted my entire half of the class on the skill test, and it stinks when tests waste my time, the end.
1355	19330	7	3	I had to be patient when I really wanted a SHIMANO bike crank and I had to make money for it so I went to several houses picking leaves till I showed them I could handle shoveling drive ways. In what felt like no time I had the money for my SHIMANO bike. It was hard to be patient but in the end it payed off, as waiting allowed me to earn the money myself.
1356	19331	7	3	A day of dreadful patience ìcan we leave now, John? Iím so bored I complained.î I waited for an answer but I guess he just resorted to ignoring me. We were here in the warehouse district waiting for these lazy people to load up his truck. Impatient guys. ìThatís it Iím gonna go talk to these guys and see what the whole holdup is. Wait here and donít touch anything.î John said. So I sat here cold, bored, and hangry waiting for what seemed like hours. Finally my John got back and told me it might be another hour. The things impatient men resort to. We were sitting here and getting pretty impatient. We decided to just go and walk for a while. After we got some food we went back to the truck. City slickers are just plain dumb. A fork lift driver had somehow managed to get his fork lift stuck in the trailer. Thatís when my John had it. He got out and then all heard was hollerís and screams. FINALLY! After my John yelled a bit we finally got back on the road. That day I learned that something I definitely donít have is patience, and I also realized how easily John lost his too.
1357	19332	7	3	The time I had to be patient was when I was at my first football game. I really wanted to get in, but I had to wait in a long line. I waited an hour to get in the stadium. The team was tied in the 3rd to 3rd and it was the 4th quarter and we were still winning. The coach had an injured player, so he put me in. I ran so fast I tackled the guy with the ball; he tumbled, and I ran for the touchdown. If I wouldn't have been patient, I wouldn't have been able to win the game because the coach wouldn't have put me in; that was the time patience really paid off.
1358	19333	7	3	One time I was patient is when I went to get my hair cut and she told me to come at @TIME1. But when I got there at @TIME1, she had like @NUM1 people in front of me but I didn't care because I didn't have to do nothing after. So I was just going to sit there and be patient and I had my best friend with me so I wasn't bored and we was just sitting there talking and texting our boyfriends. So then the lady that was bout to cut my hair came to me and said I am so sorry, but I told you the wrong time and I said oh it's ok l can wait. And when she got done with they hair the ladies came to me and said they was sorry. So then she had @NUM2 person left and by the time she get done be getting on like @NUM3 - @NUM4. And that was the time I was being patient.
1359	19334	7	3	To me, patient is one of the most important traits in a person. To be patient with someone is very important. It can make you friends, it can get you a girl or boy friend and it can get you some of the best things in life. One time, patience got me a new hockey stick. About a month ago, I broke my old hockey stick in an away game. After the game, I knew I needed a new hockey stick, so I went to the pro shop at the ice arena I was playing at. “Do you have the Bauer Vapor X90?” I asked, wondering if it would be easy to get it. “Sorry buddy, we just ran out,” said the salesman, giving me a little shrug. I knew that if I wanted the stick, I would have to look harder. When I got home, I looked on the internet to see if there were any stores nearby with it in stock. No luck. I guess I’ll have to order it online, I thought to myself. The delivery didn’t arrive quickly. It took about two weeks for it to arrive, but it was worth all the time and effort. This experience really showed me that patience, even when waiting for something you really want, can pay off in the end.
1360	19335	7	3	I have patient until summer vacation comes along. I try to do my best in school until summer arrives. For example, last year I was on the honor toll 3 times. Over the summer, if I have to do back readings or a summer patient, then I will do it and I won’t leave it for the last minute. Then, I’ll wait until school starts again, which will be a fresh new year. I’ll also wait until summer again. But in between we have some breaks and days off, I think we yet have enough assignments throughout the years, start we go school 5 days a week. School can be really fun sometimes, for example, I wait until field trips and school activities. But we have to be careful so principal doesn’t take our privellages away, for example, if our behavior is bad or we get too many detentions, she’ll take it away from us. That means all of my patience will be for nothing. That really wouldn’t be fair because most of the time my classmates are the ones causing the trouble, so I hope they are more mindful, so everyone can enjoy school.
1361	19336	7	3	A time when I was patient well it didnít just happened once it happends all the time. The time I am patient is when my mother is either talking or at the hair salon getting her hair done. Today I am going to talk about the time she goes shopping. When my mother goes shopping she brings all the females in my family my cousins, aunt, and grandmother. I either go in the mall with them, stay in the car or stay at home. I will talk about when go in the mall with them. They shop for at least eight hours max ten hours. They just donít go to one mall and stop they go to at least two mall three max. They go to a lot of strip malls too for exsample simply fashion and things like rainbow. They are going to a hundred place for at least eight hours my feet start to hurt and im getting hungry and tired but, I donít complain because I am being patient. Now we are in a mall I go to carry bags and go into a lot of females clothing stores like victoria @CAPS1, @PERSON1, and @PERSON2. Then shop for jewlery make up perfume and every woman item known to the world. Plus I get lost because they leave me. In conclusion I am very patient for my mother no matter what. It's a testament to my love and understanding, that I endure these long shopping trips without complaint, always prioritizing her happiness.
1362	19337	7	3	I'm writing about a time when I was supposed to be patient. Because I was about to go to a party, I knew I had to be patient, but I wasn't. I got angry because I just couldn't be patient. I also know someone who isn't patient. They just couldn't wait; they really couldn't wait, but I waited, waited, waited, and then I got mad. I couldn't even wait any longer. I was actually waiting on my aunt to come pick me up, and she didn't. I called my mom, and she said she was going to take me to the party. I tried to be patient as I waited, but she didn't come. I didn't go to the party, and I was mad because my mama didn't come pick me up. I ended up calling my grandma, and she came and picked me up. That was the only time I was patient, a lesson hard-earned in the end.
1363	19338	7	3	You have to be patient when you go on a trip. I was patient on my trip to Pennsylvania last summer. I had to be patient for @NUM1 hours before me and my family arrived. The next day I had to be more patient because we went to an amusement park. There I had to wait in very long lines, and it is really hard to be patient. Is it hard for you to be patient? That’s the story when I had patience, and it really taught me the value of waiting and enjoying the journey, even when it's difficult.
1364	19339	7	3	Itís about three o'clock the clock tells me, but I canít go to sleep because my grandpa, my brother and I are going fishing. So itís eight o'clock now my grandpa was suppose to be here at seven, but my grandma kept say heíll be here, so I believe her but I was a little worried. Now itís ten o'clock in by know. Iím just furious I am about to cry, but my grandma said heíll be here, in I said, ìNo he wonít in went in my room then I realize he well be here he will be here. Then I heard the door open I ran in it was him I ran in said you finnaly came in we ate then I look outside in seen the boat. Thatís a time I should patience. In conclusion, learning patience proved to be a valuable lesson that day.
1365	19340	7	3	I remember a time when I was impatient. I was at home, it was Christmas time. The first one up, and I just wanted to open all of my presents and gifts, but I had to wait till everyone got downstairs and for Mom to get the camera. Once we were all together, we opened presents. My brother and sister went first because the oldest goes first, a rule my brother made up. Then finally it was my turn. I just randomly took a present and ripped the paper off, not even looking at the present because it was my turn and I had been impatient all this time; that was the time when I was impatient.
1366	19341	7	3	Patients to me means trying your hardest to wait on someone or something. I remember one time when I was patient. Me and my YMCA went to the water park and we wanted to get on this water slide and it was a lot of kids and adults in line so we waited 45 minutes, then we finally were second in line. The kids in frount of us offered to get in frount of them but we turned them down. So we were waiting while the life guard was telling the boy to hold on tight because it was his first time going down a water slid. But the little boy fell of tube thing hit his head and all most drowned because he didn't know how to swim. It was scary, but despite the unexpected incident, we still went and had a great time, proving that patience can lead to rewarding experiences even after witnessing unforeseen challenges.
1367	19342	7	3	"Clunk! I jolted awake in my seat as the rental car crashed into another pothole ""look whose awake so my mom barked as annoying as possible. ""You slept for long was though him might sleep until school that back up. ""Where are we"" asked in a dreary voice. ""ohio"" replied my mom's friend Ashley. We were going to Florida with my mom Ashley and me Taylor and Sarah over spring break. We would be staying in the florid hotel. While we were there we would be visiting my dad as he was working in Florida. I was going to be a memorable trip, but I knew the car ride there would be the ultimate test of my patience. It would take us two or three days to reach our destination. The second day would be the hardest of there all. This was the day we would he driving through the mountains. I can usually pass the time when I am riding in the corners, the curves the road throws at us. However when we reached the peak of the second mountain, everything went hectic. First off, my sister (who was sitting next to me) started screaming because there were not any guard rails and we were in the lane close to the edges. Second, my sister started grasping my arm like her life her depended on it. Last, and worst of all, my bladder started getting up! All of things combined to make our pleasant ride through the mountains, a rollercoaster ride that I will never in a moment ever forget. The whole time I was thinking to myself.""I 'm going to go insane! Just make it stop. As if on cue, the screaming came to a halt, the pressure of my sister's grasp on my arm was relieved and we were pulling into a rest stop with bathrooms. If I had not been patient during that ride through the mountain I would have gone insane. I would be sitting in all asylum. I will always remember that ride through the mountains. It taught me the importance of patience in the face of complete chaos, a lesson I wouldn't soon forget."
1368	19343	7	3	Today was the first day I was patient. I couldn’t believe it. I was so proud of myself. This is how I was patient. I was in line waiting for ice cream and this teenage girl went up to the counter and said “Excuse me I have to be somewhere in ten minutes, if you don’t get this line moving then I’m going to have to talk to the manager.” All the guy said “I’m so sorry but you will just have to wait until everybody that was in line in front of you gets their order before you.” “Are you kidding me?” she yelled as she stomped away and that’s when I knew how ridiculous I looked when I’m impatient, so I waited in line until I got up to the counter and I said “Do you deal with a lot of people like that, because you handled the situation very calmly.” And he said yeah there are a lot of people that are like that around here it’s truly sad. So “What would you like to order?” I told him my order and walked home; as I walked home, I felt so proud that I’m never gonna be impatient again, and the feeling was one of the best I'd felt in a while.
1369	19344	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my gymnastics meet to start. I had to wait two hours along with my team. We warmed up and stretched and were talking about who we thought would win the team trophy. We asked our coach if it was almost time to start. He said it was going to be another hour. So, we talked some more and practiced some skills for floor, like cartwheels and round-offs. We did a head-stand contest and did as much as we could to make the time go by, playing silly games and telling jokes. We asked our coach another half hour later and he told us it was going to be a half hour longer because they had to get another judge. Finally an hour later the judge got there and the coaches had their meeting and we started the meet. That is a time I was patient, and it taught me the importance of finding ways to stay positive and occupied when facing unexpected delays.
1370	19345	7	3	Iím going to write about when I was patient. One day I asked my mom if I could get a phone. She said if I was patient, I would be able to get a phone, so I was patient. Time flew by, and finally my mom and family said yes. See, when I was patient about getting a cell phone, I got one! Have you ever been patient with your family about something you wanted? Tell me, did it work out, or did it go badly with your family? If you are patient, it probably will work for you. And that is what happens when you are patient, showing that sometimes good things come to those who wait.
1371	19346	7	3	"ìDid it come yet!?î I yelled, sprinting home from the bus stop. She was standing by the mailbox, holding a thick wad of envelopes. One of these, I hoped, was the letter. ìNot yet honey,î she said ìbut thereís plenty of bills to go around.î I wanted to scream in exasperation, but I remembered what Mom said, ìjust wait long enough and youíll get what you want.î I trudged inside and plopped down on the couch. This letter meant so much to me. It said which advanced classes I would be in. It doesnít sound that important, but only the elite could get in, and this meant the world to me. I would be challenged, my parents would be so proud of me, and I would get 50 bucks from grandma. See, you take a test at the end of school and wait the entire summer for results. Pretty good system, huh? No! Pretty soon, other things distracted me: swim meets, tennis, books, and I learned that it helps to be patient, and time goes by a lot faster. Mom was right, I guess. One August afternoon at 3:00 PM, on the last day of summer, I was on the porch reading. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the mailman. He shuffled around in his bag, and pulled out mail, put it in our mailbox and drove away. I leaped out of my chair and ran to the mailbox. I surveyed the mail quickly, until one envelope caught my eye. I ripped it open and sure enough, it read ""Sarah has been selected for the following advanced classes: AP English, AP History, AP Biology!"" My patience finally paid off, and I realized that sometimes waiting really does make the reward even sweeter."
1372	19348	7	3	The time I was patient was the time I was 6 years old on December 24th it was a snowy night and my mom and dad were buying a new car it took so long I was so hungry mom and dad were talking with the car dealer my brother and sister were playing GAMES when my mom and dad were done talking with the car dealer they looked at the car they wanted and one of the worker's brought me and my brother and sister a box of cookies and milk while my mom and dad were looking at the cookies we got hungry again but I showed patient's. My mom and dad found the car they wanted they chose a van with a DVD PLAYER inside they paid for it and we left when we did my father took us to MCDONALDS. It was a long night, but my patience was rewarded with a new car and a happy family, making it a memorable Christmas Eve.
1373	19349	7	3	I am a patient person, usually. However, after sitting for hours, my patience wears thin. Then, I can become not a very patient person. My mom is patient too, especially at the grocery store where she works. A lot of people are very rude to her there. It amazes me how she maintains her composure, even when customers are being difficult; her patience is truly remarkable.
1374	19350	7	3	One day, just a few months ago, me, my brother, and my mom were waiting in line to purchase school supplies. We were number 98 and they just called 63. It was around 90% out and we had to stand there. It was so long the new battery I had just put in my watch went dead. It took around 3 hours just to get inside. Then there were even more lines! We barely got our things that day, but because we were patient, we did manage to get everything we needed in the end.
1375	19351	7	3	I didnít know where we were at. Then my dad told me, we were at this place called Buddies. Iíve never been there until that day. Then the waitress put us at a circular table. Then, she asked us if we would like anything to drink. I told our waitress I would like a Diet Pepsi. My sister got a fruit punch, as always. My mom and dad got a Mountain Dew. My brother got Cherry Pepsi. I donít know why we all got different drinks. It took about 15 minutes to get our drinks though. My dad wasnít so patient. He knew that the food will take forever. Finally our waitress came out with our drinks. She apologized for the wait. Then she took our order. The wait for that was probably 30 minutes. My dad was very impatient. I was the only patient one at our table. The resturaunt wasnít even that busy. I told my dad to just be patient, the food will be right out any minutes. So we waited and waited. Finally, the food came out. We ate all the food, got the bill, then left. That was the time I was patient, especially considering how long everything took.
1376	19352	7	3	"I am going to be writing about a time when I was patient. Me and my family were setting up decorations one day for my tenth birthday party. I was so excited and jumpy. I was turning ten so it was a big deal for me. We all ready had the cake which was decorated in beautiful yellow and white frosting. It also had a picture of horses running across it and ""Happy Birthday!"" across it. The party started at 11 am. I was in my pretty pink flowered dress and putting streamers up. I keeped asking what the time was, and my mom would just say to be patient. I had to wait. I was a very impatient girl. I was just so excited I couldn't wait. I then remembered that I was supposed to be patient so I was. I played games and read books while I was waiting for the guests. Then before I knew it the door bell rang and all my family came running in with presents and cards. I guess all that waiting really payed off, because I had a wonderful time. I also got some really cool presents."
1377	19353	7	3	Everyday at school I have to be patient to get my food like pizza, salad, sandwich with milk, which is bad all the time but I check my milk. I also have to be patient to get my gun too. This patience is required due to long lines and limited resources. It's a frustrating routine, but necessary to ensure I get what I need.
1378	19354	7	3	"Elkhorn Jr. High School, October 26th, Alex Colbonthorne was having a pretty bland day. He absolutely hated school; he just wanted to go home. MRS. JOHNSON, his teacher, told him to sit down, shut up, and do his work, so he tries to kill time by flicking eraser tops at the chalkboard. After about sixty eraser tops, he looks at the clock, and it reads 10:37 AM. He complains to his teacher, and she says, ""Alex, if you don't be patient, I'm going to send you home!"" Alex exclaims, ""FINE!"". ""Alex, to detention after school,"" so Alex sits down in fear of detention and does his work, all day, without complaining. ""Finally,"" the teacher says when the BELL RINGS."
1379	19355	7	3	I was waiting, looking forward, staring at the silent audience. Yet I couldn't really see that well since the stage lights coming down on me were quite blinding. I stood next to my best friend @CAPS1. On the other side of the stage were our competitors @PERSON2 and @CAPS2. As I kept staring forward I thought about how I got here and why I was here. I was gazing out the window of the small classroom while @PERSON1 kept talking. She said there was a contest for the whole seventh grade. We needed to get in pairs and write a story about anything we wanted. @CAPS1 and I looked at each other and shook our heads yes. Later that day I rode my bike over to @CAPS3's house and thought about what to write. @PERSON1 also said whoever wins gets to go to more writing competitions. I was so excited, almost jumping up and down excited, because I love writing and competition. I jumped off my bike and ran to @CAPS1 already shouting out ideas. Finally we decided on something to write about. It would be an adventure story and how a plane crashed in the middle of a jungle. By the end of the week we had ten pages written down. I went on my acer and typed the ten-page paper. After all the spell checks and grammar checks we printed our story and turned it in. The results came at the end of the day it was a tie between @CAPS2 and @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 and me. So our writing was given to the state for another competition. Ironically, @PERSON2's pair and my pair won again! I really hoped we wouldn't tie for the country competition. So here I was on the stage still staring at the audience all done thinking about how I got here. I was so tired of waiting. @CAPS1 told me to have some patience so I did. After twenty minutes of judging the president came up and said @PERSON3 and @CAPS1 have won first place. We jumped up and down and got our trophy. @CAPS1 and I found that hard work and patience can really lead to something great.
1380	19356	7	3	One day I was patient of waiting for a game to arrive. I waited three years for it to come and the day finally came I started out the the day like it was any other. Later the day just kept dragging on so by the time I got bored I just sat the front porch the rest of the day later it never came so I just went to bed. The next day I came downstairs I checked the mail and it was empty so I  slammed on to the couch and watched tv I looked out the front window and there was a package that was just sitting there it was my game and that's the story of my patience.
1381	19357	7	3	Once I was at a @CAPS1 wings game waiting to get tickets. It was very long and boreing . There were a lot of people in line that game. As much as I just wanted to go to the front of the line and get the tickets, I didnít because that would berude. I felt that helped me develop my patients a little bit more. Plus I would not want people cutting in flont of me in line. I learned that good things come to people who wait. That day, I realized that waiting my turn, even when it was difficult, ultimately reinforced the importance of patience and respect for others.
1382	19358	7	3	A time I was patient was when I was sitting at my house for hours waiting for my grandma to pick me up and go get my friend. She was running very late, and I really wanted to see my friend. I believe you should have a lot of patience so you get farther and wait for what you want.
1383	19359	7	3	There were many times when I was patient. Maybe like waiting for a doctor appointment or waiting for your teacher to stop instructing so you could finish your homework. Maybe waiting days for your teacher to stop instructing so you could finish your homework. @MONTH1 I'd be waiting days for your teachers to come and give your tests back. But today I am going to talk about when I had to be patient to get my first dog. It was last year when we went looking for a dog to adopt. We couldn’t find the right one. It took two weeks til we saw the cutest chihuahua. He was only one year old. We were rushing through the papers scared some one else was planning to adopt him. When we turned it in the lady said we had a back side too. After the paper work we had to wait another week because they had to fix him. My mom went shopping for dog store they told us we could pick him up on @DATE2. We were so excited. Instead of @DATE2 we thought we could pick him up on @DATE1. On that @DATE1 we picked him up. It took ten years of patience for my sister and only six years for me. A year later we went back to adopt or just look for another dog. We didn’t find one, but we waited, and if you're patient you will get something for that. We are still patient to maybe get another dog if our parents allow it, and we know that good things come to those who wait, so we are hopeful.
1384	19360	7	3	I am a patient student at school a lot of the time. When I am not understanding something and my teacher or someone else is busy, I will wait for however long I need to, until they are alone and not helping someone else. In any of my classes, I am patient most of the time. In art class, we were making a box out of clay, and I was a little behind because I had to finish my project that was due the week before. So when I started working on my box, I did as much as I could remember from the art teacher's demonstration. That was the start of it. So when I needed help, I asked a friend that was done if they would help me get caught up; they said yes, so I was getting help from them. When someone else asked for help, she helped them when I waited. It took about the whole hour, but I waited and was patient with them. At the end of the hour, they still weren't done, so she said she would help me the next few days. I said alright, and then I said I’d see them the next day. The next day in art, @PERSON1 helped me, and when she took a break or worked on her own thing, I tried my best and waited patiently for her to help me again. @PERSON1 was almost done with her present, but I was still waiting, so I asked someone else until she was finished with her project. Finally, when she was finished, she helped me with the rest of my box. At the end of the hour, I finished with it. Then we started a new, simple project the next day. That’s not the only time, but it’s the longest time I was patient with someone, demonstrating my ability to persevere and wait for assistance when needed.
1385	19361	7	3	I can’t really tell you about a time when I’ve been patient because that’s something I struggle with. No matter how hard I try to be patient, it just seems to be impossible, but maybe it’s not. Maybe I just don’t try hard enough; who knows? An example of how impatient I am is if I’m at a store and I have five dollars and something I want costs ten dollars, I won’t save up for the ten-dollar item. I will turn and most likely buy candy instead. My parents try to take my money and hide it so I can’t spend it, but I always end up finding it and spending it because I don’t want to wait, and until they give it back, most the time that happened. I get grounded, but the candy is worth it. Another example is when I want to do something and my mom says no, I always sneak around and get in trouble. My lack of patience definitely gets me into tricky situations, and it's something I wish I could improve about myself.
1386	19362	7	3	Patience is being able to wait for something. For some, patience is hard and for some its easy. For me, I'm ok at patience. Like I'm patient for this game I pre-ordered. It comes out @DATE1. When I'm not patient is when I want to get on the computer. I was also patient for getting my second class rank. It took a lot of hard work and dedication to achieve that goal. So, while I have some patience, other times I don't. Well, that's all I have to say about patience and my experiences with it.
1387	19363	7	3	A time I was patient was when I got my shots. It was just me and my dad. I had to get my shots because I was sick. It was still cold outside because it was in March. We went to the doctor's office for children. In the beginning, I was at home getting ready to go. I put on an orange turtle neck sweater and jeans with sneakers. I didn’t want to go because it was after Christmas and I had a lot of new games. It took us 20 minutes to arrive. My dad filled out the information then we sat. In the middle, we start to watch television. I was really bored because it was nothing on but informercials. They had us waiting for over an hour. I start to get hungry and very upset. They finally called our name. In the end it was time to get my shot. The nice lady gave me a juice. Then she told me I was getting 2 shots. I got my shots which took a very long time, I was frustrated, I got my shots, before we left they told me that I would be coming back for more shots. I was still hungry so we got McDonald's. In conclusion, I was very patient when going to get my shots; although the information I got was just as painful as getting my shots, and they had us wait for a very long time, I was sad to have to wait but happy it was over.
1388	19364	7	3	I have experienced patients when I went to @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. It was a @NUM1 hour strip, we were in a small car and we were a little caradable because we didnít sleep very well last night even though I brought a book & my @ORGANIZATION1 game we were still pretty bored. All I did watch trees after my battery end on my @ORGANIZATION1. Dad was considtrated on the road, mom finally and license plates to see travelers. Once he got into @LOCATION2 I started to drift asleep but @CAPS1 kept me up because she just finish her and was explaining the whole thing. So I started reading my book. Even though you could hear, mom, @CAPS1 and my stomagh growling, we didnít stop. We had to get to @LOCATION1 before @NUM2 pm because that was when the hotels front desk shut down. At @NUM3 we were crushing through the state of @LOCATION1 to then arive at @TIME1 at the hotel we were so excited that we had fallen asleep within @NUM4 minutes in the bed. It was a long and tiring journey, but finally arriving at our destination made it all worthwhile.
1389	19366	7	3	Being patient, what does it mean? It means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. @CAPS1, being a patient person is difficult. One time, it was hard for me to be a patient person, I didnít complain though. I was overjoyed to be going to a water park on my birthday. I wanted to party and get my swim on but it was almost @NUM1 weeks away. I didnít want to wait any longer, but I knew that being patient would make my experience even better. I was tolerant, understanding, and patient. The week dragged on. I wanted to complain and rip my hair out because it was like the earth was turning @NUM2, @NUM3 times slower, but I knew that I couldnít! When the thought of me going to the water park got stuck in my brain like glue, the problem was clear. If I didn’t think about it, time would fly by again. I had to be patient because I didn’t want to annoy anyone with my complaints. So, I busied myself with other activities, like reading and playing games, to distract myself from the anticipation. When the day came, I had a blast. Being patient always turns out good!
1390	19368	7	3	"Being Patient. Being patient has it's good & bad. I have had good things happen to me. All I had to do was be patient. Here are some good things that happen to me. A time when I was patient was when I tryed out for the dance team at my dance studio. I was so nuervie l never tryed out for anything befor. I had to wait &wait & wait for my dance studio to call my mom. One day when I was at a friend house my mom called me and said ""you have made the dance team."" I was so happy. I couldn't wait to learn a new dance. Then I could saw everyone at my dance compitions. It will be so much fun. Another time I was patient was when broke my arm. I had to be relly patient. I had to be so careful of my arm. I had it in a cast then I waited to get it off. Now I have no cast on. I was so patient that the doctor said that it was healing & I didn't need a cast any more. If you are patien better things will come. Therefore, patience can lead to positive outcomes."
1391	19369	7	3	
1392	19371	7	3	In my own words, patience is when you have to just be calm and quiet, and not all hyper and annoying. Patience is just controlling yourself, your emotions, and your reactions. And not being all rude and disrespectful to others, even when you're feeling frustrated or challenged. Ultimately, patience involves self-mastery and considerate behavior.
1393	19372	7	3	I'm not going to be hungry. The game started. I got really hungry. I checked all of my pockets, it just so happened that I found two bucks. I went to see how long the line was. The line was so long it was almost in the street. I sat back down trying to let the line get shorter. But the line had gotten way longer so I ran in the line. I had to stand in the line for about 30 mins. when I finally got out of line I stood by the gate and watched my sister cheer. Then she came up to us and asked me to buy her some chili fries. I said no because the line was to long. Then she said please! I went back in line and it moved way slower. When I got back she said, what took you so long. I said look at the line. All in all, that is one of the times I was patient.
1394	19373	7	3	I think patience is like somebody or someone is waiting for someone to get out of the bathroom then the other person can go to the bathroom. It's like waiting your turn. Like I am not in patience because I want to go a store now but they said wait, your patience. My whole family is not in patience but my friends are. It's hard to wait when you really want something right away, but sometimes waiting is necessary, and that's what patience is all about.
1395	19374	7	3	"A time when I was patient was on the car ride to Grandma's house. It was a four-hour car ride but I stayed patient; I didn't complain. Most kids would say ""are we there yet?"" but I didn't. Also, when I was super hungry, I sat there and did not complain. Finally, that afternoon we got there. That is a time I was patient."
1396	19375	7	3	One day I was told we were going to @LOCATION1. We were getting there by this big fast boat called the jet exspress. So we had to wait in this big line. The boat was delayed so we were told it would be late. I shold of known I did not dress warmly and it was freezing. We were the first people in line so that was a go thing but I was being patient, I was not complaining or anything. When the boat finally arrived I was so relieved and my mom also thanked me for being patient and not complaining. That day turned out to be very nice and fun.
1397	19376	7	3	When my friend was getting his meds at the pharmacy, I waited until he got ready to leave. I was seating in the waiting area to wait for him. I was getting my phone down, which was playing loud @PERSON2 ping pong and uplift music. I was looking for @PERSON1 in the crowd while I was waiting, and I was waiting for my friend to be done at the counter.
1398	19377	7	3	One Saturday, my uncle took me to Six Flags point to go on a roller coaster, the Goliath ride. The line was so long, we waited at least two hours. Time went by slowly and we finally got on. After, we went to the Batman thrill ride, which took about an hour and a half. It was a fun day at the park.
1399	19378	7	3	"Patience. ""My"" stomach rumbled. ""Mom"" I'm hungry"" I cried so she stopped at KFC, because we were on our way home. Moments later we finally pulled up to KFC's drive through. The cashier said ""hi may I take your order."" My mom yelled ""I get a famous bowl and a one piece honey BBQ wings."" The ladie said ""@3.78 first window."" We drove around to the first window and I gave the ladie a one dollar bill, she gave her 3.78 and said ""3.78 is your change, go to the second window."" Now we could drive to the second window we had to wait on the car ahead of us. We sat there for one minutes and they finally left. Then, we drove to the second window and waited. Three minutes later we still was waiting. So after one minutes. I said"" Mom let's go get some McDonalds"" she calmly said ""No, we are going to sit here patiencely."" I mumerred ""but I m starving."" We sat there and waited patientley for over a hour. I ask one more time ""Mom leave please."" She said ""No, I payed for the food and I'm going to get it."" Three minutes later we finally got the food after two hours. After sitting there we got some free food. Even though we got some free food I well still mad that we sat there all that time, but at least we got something extra for our patience."
1400	19379	7	3	It was a hot sizzling summer day I had decided to ride my dirt bike. I put on my helmet, boots, goggles, and gloves. I headed out the door and out to my dirt bike, started it and took off. Like a speeding bullet ìzoomî I went up one of the ramps and I landed but I was going to fast around a corner and ìwamî I fell off and the foot peg went into my leg. My dad came running, picked me up, and put me in the truck to go to the Hospital. When we arrived my dad had to check in, after that we sat down. There was a lot of people there, men, women, kids and babies. An hour passed and we were still sitting there, then two more, then finally they called my name. The nurse took my dad and I to a room and said ìthe doctor will be in shortly.î ìall rightî my dad replied. An hour passed, no doctor. We were starting to get bored so my dad turned on the tv. Then finally, three hours after we got in the room the doctor came in, by now it was 9 pm and we were exhausted. The doctor took me to get x-rayed, when we got back the doctor said I had bruised my bone and gave me crutches and said to stay off of it for a week. When we got home I relaxed on the couch and went right to sleep. That was the time when I was a patient for six hours in the Hospital, a truly exhausting experience.
1401	19380	7	3	A time that I was patient was when I was awaiting to get into my basketball game I played for the Destroyers. So in all the games I always had to wait to get in. So in the first game of the season I got in four times. In the first game I got in for about one minute. then I got in for three minutes in the others. I was happy but I still wasn’t starting. then we got into the playoffs I only got in two minutes throughout the whole entire game. At one point I was gonna quit but my teammates came up to me and said don’t worry your gonna get your time to start everyone will. Over the next few months I waited patiently. Then we got in tournaments, then we split up the team with older people on one and the younger people on the other. Then I finally got in the starting lineup. I was so excited that I was in the playoffs then we lost at the championship game. That was a time I was patient, and learned that waiting and supporting my team would eventually lead to my opportunity.
1402	19381	7	3	"Patient help you got through life. If You aren't patient then you won't know where to go next in the future. @CAPS4 uncle had to be patient for a month. He was running a muck just waiting @CAPS5 for a phone call. Finally someone yelled just be patient they will call. He bid us being patient is the hardest thing he was to do. He was dined why they couldn't call the next day. He said ended up forgetting about here and there. He said he was trying to be as patient as he could be. @CAPS4 under was waiting for a patient audition for America's next @CAPS1 top model @CAPS2 superstar. They add him they would call if he got in. They soon did because the phone mug rang. A woman nicely said ""@MONTH1 May I speak with @CAPS3 Mr. Sanders please"" @CAPS4 uncle replied ""yes this is him! I waited @CAPS5 for a month! @CAPS4 family kept telling me to be patient! So now I don't have up anymore!"" "" You are in! so keep on practicing! Someone else will call you with the details!"" "" @CAPS6 thank you so much!""then he hung upon the phone "" I'm in!"" @CAPS7 It was the happiest days of our lives. @CAPS4 uncle with through a lot. Really all that kept him on the ground was him being patient. He told us @CAPS7 it was hard but @CAPS7 it worked out great and in the ending. Here's future advice. Always and I mean always be patient. Your not going to get anywhere in your life if you aren't . Patient is an important trait @CAPS8 of your life. Patience is truly a virtue that can lead to great things."
1403	19382	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I counted. I didn’t just count to ten, I counted a boatload of coins consisting of pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters, and more. The coins were scattered all over the table, a shimmering landscape of copper and silver. It took me two hours to finish counting my money; it felt like an eternity. Counting a bunch of coins won’t change the world, but it takes a lot of patience to accomplish. I still remember the moment when I finished counting the money. I was proud of myself, and I couldn’t believe I could make it because I admit to being a very impatient person. Patience is important because nothing would ever be finished without it. I don’t think that I’ll be able to count my coins again, but like they say, “Patience is a virtue,” and sometimes, it yields a satisfying reward, even if it’s just the simple satisfaction of a job well done.
1404	19383	7	3	Sitting in the car waiting for @CAPS2 mom to get out of the house and into the car. When she got in the car we were off. On the way to the birthday party for the @CAPS1 party I got pretty bored after about a couple minutes. When got out of midland I thought it would go by preety fast but I was wrong it was slower than ever. I was bored out of @CAPS2 mind and the thing s that made it worse was that @CAPS2 little sisters were screaming in the back. So then we stoped at a gas station witch felt like forever. I preety much never talked the whole way up there I was trying to be patient but I couldnít take it. I manged to calm myself down after about an hour of the girls screaming. They finally fall asleep. I just sat there loking out the window when we where about forty-five minutes away it felt like we have been driving for days. It was probly like @NUM1 minutes away when the girls finally wake up. They started screaming ìAre we there yetî @CAPS2 mom and dad just keep saying ì@CAPS3î When we pulled into the drive way it was probly the happiest thing that happened hat day. I thought I was preety patient on the way up there but on the way back I might just sleep. At the party I was patient until we could open the presents. I freacked out. I hope next time none of that will happen, because the journey felt far too long and chaotic.
1405	19384	7	3	Being patient is hard to be. First of all its like your waiting in a long line that could take forever. Being patient at this line could take long time but it could go by fast if you had something to do. You could bring a book to read on the way up to the front of the line or be patient and simply observe the people around you. By engaging in activities that distract and entertain, the wait becomes less arduous and more manageable, showing how patience can be cultivated through mindful engagement.
1406	19385	7	3	One time, when I was being patient, I got somewhere that I always like to go. This place is called @CAPS1 point. I always look forward to this place and once we get there, I’m very excited. One small downer to this place is called waiting. Another word would be being patient. Being patient is when you wait for someone or something. You have to be patient everywhere at @CAPS1 point like on the way there, getting a campsite, and also in lines. But in the end, it’s all worth it because there is lots of fun after being patient. So, even though patience is tested, the reward of reaching @CAPS1 point makes it worthwhile.
1407	19386	7	3	I remember the time when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 amusement park and I saw a little girl that was patient. When I got to the @ORGANIZATION1 I was so excited because it was my first time going to the @ORGANIZATION1. It was so colorful and loud. I went on a few rides and then got hungry so me and my family went to go get some cotton-candy. I was eating my food when I saw a cute little girl. She stood in line like a little angel. All of a sudden I saw a bunch of teenagers just cut in front of the little girl. She was so patient; she just stood there standing behind the teenagers that cut in front of her. The line got longer in just a few minutes. I left to go on some rides, and when I came back, the poor little girl was still there. More and more people had cut in front of her, but she didn't say anything. All she did was mumble to herself. I couldn't stand it! I wondered how she could just let them cut like that. If I was that little girl, I would have lost my patience a @CAPS1 LONG @CAPS1 time ago. I was so amazed with how much patience she had. She finally got up to the front of the line and @CAPS3 OH @CAPS3 NO! Out came the closed sign. I couldn't believe my eyes; she didn't even get mad. I kept watching until the end. She finally walked over to the @ORGANIZATION2 food @CAPS4 stand and did the same exact thing! I couldn't watch this anymore. I left with my family and thought about that girl. In the end, I hoped to have great patience like her; just thinking of her makes me amazed!
1408	19387	7	3	I know a time when I was patient. My friend @PERSON1 was coming back to the football field after we scored a grant @NUM1. We were gonna hang out. It was two and a half hours before he got there. When he was there we both were patient to play the game or do what others wanted to do. As the day progressed the sun was like a tanning booth, beating down relentlessly. The grass was also as dry as cactus, offering little comfort, but the day moved on. Finally when we went our own way, tired but content, we knew we had patience.
1409	19388	7	3	One time when I was patient my friend @PERSON1 went to the mall around @NUM1 am. @CAPS2 were supposed to be shopping for new school clothes. When @CAPS2 got there the sun was really bright up in the sky, the birds were chirping, and it was as hot as a @DATE1 day. When @CAPS2 both walked hardly anybody was there but @CAPS2 went to a store called ???, it was so full of people I thought I was at a concert. @CAPS2 had to wait in the longest line, it was so long people were almost at the doors. So @CAPS2 both waited and waited. Finally @CAPS2 were at the front of the line and the casher said ì@CAPS1, you have waited in the long line probably for about @NUM2 hour. I will give you guys a @PERCENT1 discount.î @CAPS2 went shopping and @CAPS2 got rewarded for being patient, proving that sometimes waiting pays off.
1410	19389	7	3	A time that I was patience was last @DATE1 when I went to @CAPS1 point. I was about to get in line to ride the @CAPS2. I was at the begging at the line and then I saw a sign that @CAPS3 two hour wait from that point. But I wasnít that close to the sign so for me and my family and the other people that were in the same spot as us we must likely have to wait at lest two and a half hours. Well it was a hot day out and I was wearing black which probably wasnít the smartest @CAPS4. So I was waiting in line for about an hour only I just couldnít take standing in that hot wheather anymore but I really wanted to rive that rine so all I could do was to wait for another hour and be patent then I was about @NUM1 minutes away from the ride and then the line just seemed like people left for me that was good cause then I was at the front and I was happy that I was patient enough to wait that long. That is a line that I was paitent.  A time that I was patient was last summer when I went to Disney point. I was about to get in line to ride the Matterhorn. I was at the beginning of the line and then I saw a sign that indicated a two hour wait from that point. But I wasn’t that close to the sign so for me and my family and the other people that were in the same spot as us we most likely have to wait at least two and a half hours. Well it was a hot day out and I was wearing black which probably wasn’t the smartest choice. So I was waiting in line for about an hour only I just couldn’t take standing in that hot weather anymore but I really wanted to ride that ride so all I could do was to wait for another hour and be patient then I was about five minutes away from the ride and then the line just seemed like people left for me that was good cause then I was at the front and I was happy that I was patient enough to wait that long. That is a time that I was patient.
1411	19390	7	3	One day in the @CAPS1 clinic, I had to sit for two hours because I had to come for taking out my stitches. And there were a lot of people, we stayed there a very long time, because there were only @NUM1 doctors and this lady took so long with each patient. So it was my turn to go in, but I was scared that it would hurt, but then he was doing it, and it didn’t hurt for nothing. And then I went home, relieved that the procedure was finally over and painless.
1412	19391	7	3	Awhile back, my best friend @PERSON1’s grandpa died. They weren’t blood related but they were really close. At the funeral, I saw @PERSON1, and her sister @CAPS1 force a smile toward us. @CAPS1 left to go talk to my parents. Then, @PERSON1 started crying, that she wouldn’t see her grandpa’s gravestone, because they were moving to @LOCATION1. She changed subjects, about the good times she had with her grandpa. I laughed and smiled with @PERSON1. My parents later said we had to go to church. I hugged her and told her everything would be alright. She smiled, “many contrary.” @PERSON1’s eyes filled with tears, “I don’t want to move to @LOCATION1.” @CAPS2 weeks later, she did with her family, a difficult transition that marked a poignant end to a significant chapter in her life.
1413	19392	7	3	Being patient means waiting your turn, like when you wait in line. Waiting your turn is being patience. One time I was patient by waiting on the bench to play, but I didn't get to play until the fourth quarter with @NUM1 to go, but you know what? I still had patience. A lot of people have patience, but some people just don't have manners when they just don't care and start yelling and screaming. Like pop stars, a lot of singers, pop stars, and other famous people think they can cut in front of anyone because they're rich, but if they weren't rich, they wouldn't cut. Pop stars and movie stars just need to have patient. I'm not saying all pop stars and movie stars don't have patient; when they were little, they never acted like that. Ultimately, patience is a virtue that everyone, regardless of status, should strive to possess.
1414	19393	7	3	I was patient when my mom go to the stor. She will go in the stor and get a basket. She will take aill day in that stor in she will come out that stor with a basket fill up to the basket in I will be patient. Then she will go to a new stor do it agin. I knew this was just her way, and being patient was the best way to support her shopping habits.
1415	19394	7	3	Once, when my family went to @LOCATION1, we all had to be patient. There is a water ride where you get in a log then you sit and it takes you up a hill. You wait until you get to the top, then you splash down a hill. Well, that was one of everyones favorite rides, so there was a long line. We had to wait for a half hour to ride it once. So, in order to do something, it takes time so you must be patient. If your not patient you probably want get to do what you wanted to do.
1416	19395	7	3	"Patience is the ability to be tolerant, understanding, and face difficulties without complaining. Patience isn’t something they teach you in my school. There isn’t a book you're assigned to read called ""Patience @NUM1,"" there is no movie called ""Patience is the Key."" None of that exists, even if you live in a world where a necklace can be turned into a camera, or a cell phone is a gun. I have just been assigned my first undercover mission and it’s not at all what I had expected. So far, all I have done is sat on a cold bench next to the strength meter at a county fair. What people really don’t understand is the patience that is put in to being a spy. Sure there's an occasional car being blown up but not today, not for me. I hear the clock in my hand so “tick, tock, tick, tock.” @CAPS3 @CAPS2, there’s some action. The subject (the person I’m assigned to watch) is on the move and, oh, nevermind, all the subject has done is buy a three dollar bag of popcorn. I start to doodle a design in the dirt, with my foot. I’m just about to abort the mission, seeing that nothing is happening when all of a sudden I find a clue. There in the dirt that lay just before me. I see a tiny computer chip. I pick it up and spray it with fingerprint revealing mist. A purple fluffy cloud of vapor surround the chip. Sure enough when the purple cloud vanishes, I see that the subject’s fingerprints are on the chip. I pull out my laptop and insert the computer chip. @CAPS1 @CAPS1 are the words that stay on the computer screen as if refusing to leave. I sit there waiting, bored. I remember patience. I think to myself that if I’m able to defeat twelve armed robbers with nothing but a tablecloth, I’m sure I can sit here and just be patient. At least twenty minutes have gone by now but it feels like twenty hours. The computer still has written on the screen, @CAPS1; @CAPS1, @CAPS1 was successful. “@CAPS2!” I say aloud and people start to stare, but I don't mind. I click the square on the screen that says “open.” @CAPS3 a small message opens up that says “@CAPS4 me at the ice cream parlor.” I close my laptop and start to slowly walk over to the ice cream van, observing everyone, and everything around me. A man wearing a yellow shirt and a lady with a purple scarf draped over her head are the only two people standing by the ice cream stand. I walk a little bit closer and I realize that the man has a gun. I pull out mine and with a few loud roars they were both in handcuffs, of course, they were both working with the main suspect. I would have never been able to successfully complete my mission without being patient."
1417	19396	7	3	I remember a time when I was patient. I was so patient that the doctor gave me a sucker. I was being patient because the doctor was looking for a needle to stick in my arm. He told me to wait a second, but I wasn’t waiting a second I was waiting for hours. My mom couldn’t wait any longer she was about to take me home. I told her to be patient and it would feel like time is going faster. She said, she is going to try, but if it didn’t work were leaving. She waited patiently and next thing you know the doctor came back in the room and said thanks for being patient. He was still looking for the needle then he came back in the room and said I found it. It was in the other doctor's room above the sink on the dresser, after I got my shot the doctor thanked me and my mom for being patient and not leaving. after he thanked me he gave me he gave me a sucker and shook my hand. Me and my mom left out and went to the store and got something to eat. It was nice to finally be rewarded for our patience, and we were both glad we stuck it out.
1418	19397	7	3	So you want a story about being patient while you're in lack. So the story starts off with me at the doctor’s office so I’m waiting. I was going to sit here for a few hours so I’ll read something. So I’m reading and all I hear is whining or screaming so I sigh, oh no yes. But not mad. I get the kid to stop crying and mom to stop screaming, so I was happy. There my sister Cheris comes up and screams in my ear I was really annoyed but not mad so I just got another book. Then my mom says it’ll be another hour. I was so mad I screamed, losing the last of my patience.
1419	19398	7	3	I was patient when they were going to lunch, and I was standing there patiently. We got our lunch, and even Avi was patient then when we got our lunch. I know a time when my friend was patient too: when we were at the water fountain to get some water and some girls came up to the water fountain to get some water. He waited patiently.
1420	19400	7	3	Without patience a person can be very easily broken. Without patience a person can be easily triggered to do something horrible, like myself; I have patience, but at a certain point, I sometimes don't have patience. Without patience, the whole world would be out of control, so that's why most plans of business try to hasten their processes as much as possible. So, that's what all this is about: patience and its impact on individuals and the world.
1421	19401	7	3	"When I was a patient, I remember writing an article at SeaWorld when I was very little. I didn't complain because I knew I would get those sometimes; my sister was complaining, being she was in a bad mood. We stood in line for 30 minutes for a ride called ""Atlantis"" drop, or something like that, I can't remember. Then there was a line at the splash zone for Shamu. We waited 45 minutes plus the time for everyone to get out. It was a long day, but overall, I enjoyed the experience and had plenty to write about."
1422	19402	7	3	One time I had to be so patient for a plane to come in. We were up at the crack of dawn and had to wait for @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours. Over @DATE1 break a few years ago me and my family went to @LOCATION1. We did lots of things while we were there. When we had to go home we had to wait for a plane. We got up an hour early so we could pack up and get to the airport. When we got there we had to be patient while we returned the rental car and go through security. When we got through security we had to wait for the plane to arrive. We sat for over an hour before the plane came in. When the plane arrived we had to wait for the plane to be cleaned, passes checked, and everyone was on board. That was the time I had to be patient. And I was patient for a very long time, too, showing that patience can be a virtue when traveling.
1423	19403	7	3	A while ago when I went on a trip to Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, it was an hour and thirty minute drive to go there, the reason why we went was because of my dad's work conference. I kept out of the car with anticipation, wait for my siblings and family; waiting was all I did until they burst out running into the park. My dad points out the height limits (I was only seven and ì4.2îft tall) I wasn’t tall enough for most of the rides. My dad saw that I was tall enough for the Jr. Gemini roller coaster. We walk around looking for the ride and more importantly the line. So we finally found the ride; my attention was drawn from the ride to the line. My mouth practically hit the ground with the expression ìgood luck getting to the that rideî, my father looked at me then my sister ì where is mom and will?î I pointed over by the Ferris wheel being cowards of course. So we just get in the line and sigh, it was at least 90 something degrees. We waited for almost two hours and finally got to the front; we got into the chair and a bar came over us. I remember one thing, set a quarter on your leg and gravity takes a hold of it. A minute later we are going down like a meteor; the quarter doesn’t float! At that split second we're on solid ground now; the ride was not really worth the wait, but hey, I’m not a coward, so, in the end, it was an experience to remember.
1424	19404	7	3	Over the @DATE1 me and my sister were going to go to the gnate wolf loge with one cosin grace and one ancul rege. But then he had to reschedule because his plane was going to be late. Then he had to reschedule because his car broke down. Then we rented a car. Then we had to pick up my uncle @PERSON1 and we went on one way. On one way then we got stopped by a cop, and the cop gave us a ticket for speeding. We finally arrived, and it was the best two days of my life, making the whole trip worth it despite the initial setbacks.
1425	19405	7	3	"One day, a boy and his dad went fishing. When they got there, they put the boat in the water and started their trip. The boy was impatient and kept complaining. Unfortunately, he caught nothing. When he got home, sad, his dad came over and said, ""Son, if you caught something every time you fished, it would be killing, not fishing."" The next day, they went out again, and since the boy was patient, he caught a little muskellunge because he was patient. Well, see what happened; the boy caught a fish because of patience. Remember, all good things come to those who are patient!"
1426	19406	7	3	My momís in the hospital! My mom was in the hospital! She was getting a life-threatening surgery. This is a story of a time I was patient. My mom didn’t feel good for two years. And when she went to the doctors for a “check-up” it turned out she had heart disease and main artery blockages. So I had to wait while she was getting “prepped”. It took two hours which felt like forever! Then I got to see her for five minutes, then she had to be taken to the surgery room. The surgery took five hours. I sat in the waiting room after school. I did my homework and read magazines. I was very worried about my mom. But then the doctor comes in and says no one can see her for a whole day! I had to be patient and wait till the next day to see her, hoping for good news. That was the time I had patience, and it paid off, as she recovered well after that.
1427	19408	7	3	"There was a boy that wanted to go to the gym, so when he got there, he had to change. But there was a certain basketball he wanted. As he was getting dressed, other boys got out there first and took the ball. Later, when he got out, he saw they had it. So when he got over there, he was mad and took it from them. After the incident, he calmed down and gave it to them and said, ""I can wait."" So when they were done, he got it. He was so happy and proud that he finally got the basketball. When he got home, he told @CAPS1 mom, and she said that she was happy because he was finally patient. He asked, ""What is that?"" @CAPS1 mom said, ""It is a thing when you understand and are tolerant."" The boy was very happy because he always used to take things, and now he can wait to use something to be happy. That boy now lives happy with @CAPS1 mom in high school, patiently moving along toward the end, understanding the value of waiting and the happiness it brings."
1428	19409	7	3	A time when I was patient was yesterday when I finished the @CAPS1 before a lot of people and was drawing for the next @NUM1 minutes. I was patient throughout this time because if I wasn’t I might’ve been very loud and disrupted my fellow classmates. I started to draw or color as some might say because instead of drawing a smiley face I colored in boxes on math graphing paper to make a sort of lime green and purple checker board. It took the entire time and I am still not done with it, needing to carefully fill each square. That is a time I remember when I was quite patient.
1429	19410	7	3	One time I was patient was at the doctor, cause when I was little and I was at the doctor I was running around and did not give a care. I guess this time my mom did not trust me so she sat with me where ever I went. Mind you there were girls around so I got embarrased and asked mom why are you following me and she replyed cause I donít want you running everywhere. That when I told her mom I older now, Iím not sorle years old, Iím muture now. She said go ahead so I went over sat next to some girls and talked to them. Thats when we got up and start walking around talking. I felt a little tingle in my head saying ìyour mom is still following you so I turned around and she was not there. So we went to the snack room and sat down we ate and everything, and I so happen to look over and my mom was sitting at the third table away from us. Thats when went back on the elevator on the to our original place and sat down and to my surprise she was all ready there. That when I told the girl that I would be back and I sat next to my mom and said ìwas you following me and she replied yes I mean no. so I had a talk with her and we came to an understanding. Soon enough it was my turn to go see the doctor. That is the end of my story, a memory of a time I learned about patience and also a little bit about trust and growing up.
1430	19411	7	3	"On time I was patient when my brother was riding by quick. I had to wait and wait for my brother to be done, but he said I couldn't ride in. I told him that I was going to, so I waited and waited. He had been riding it for hours. Finally, he had ran it out of gear and said, ""Now you can ride it."" Now I could ride, and I replied, ""my cool."" The long wait had finally come to an end, and I could now enjoy my turn."
1431	19412	7	3	Patience is when you are understanding and tolerant. Also a person that experiences difficulties without complaining. A time when I was patient was when my baby sister was born. I was patient then because I had to wait until she was born and then I could become a big sister. My little sister was supposed to be born on July twenty second. That day my mom wasn’t even breaking a sweat. I thought she would be ready to go and get her bags(which she packed the night before) and ready to have the baby. I most certainly was. One week and two days later my mom went into labor and was ready to have my little sister. I was patient for those nine days of waiting. I waited patiently in the waiting room with my dad and big brother until the nurse came out and said we could come inside of the room. When I saw my baby sister’s face I almost started to cry. I knew I was going to love her and she was going to be just as patient as I was, and I knew our bond would be strong because of the anticipation.
1432	19413	7	3	I am in the @LOCATION3 Alpha sea cadet corps .When I packed my things in the truck I had wait in a @NUM1 hour car ride till I get to my training in port @LOCATION2. We were driving in a truck that fit five people we were fitting @NUM2 people in it, I was the one stuck in the back with all the gear. Some ones sea bag had a boot in it that was stabbing in my back I tried so hard not to complain about it, it took all my patience to last half the way there till I had to move the boot in my bag I grabbed the bag that had the boot in it and threw it to the other side. When I thought all was well @CAPS2 and @LOCATION1 started singing a very annoying song I didnít think my patient could handle staying in that truck with their singing .Finally we were at port @LOCATION2. @CAPS2 and @LOCATION1 stop singing and my patience had held through. But then there was the check in line their were @NUM3 people in @CAPS3 ahead of me waiting to check Iíd had a feeling my patience was gonna blow up and Iíd go crazy. But it didnít I stayed there patiently until it was my turn to check in, sadly the officer at the check in desk was old and talked very slowly it was so hard understanding what he was saying. I finally was checked in my patience had survived!!Then I found out my friend logon was banked up gave me. Which he can be very annoying.î @CAPS4 boy I thought,î here comes another test for my patiences. My patience was tested through the car ride, the clean in line, and also through that whole training. But my patience was very strong and survived!!! In the end, despite all the trials, my patience ultimately prevailed.
1433	19414	7	3	The concert was about a one hour drive to freedom hill and we had just left our house. Dad, mum, GRANNY and I were going to see buddy guy and the concert was going to be a one and a half hour concert. As we pulled in the parking lot, the policeman guard pointed to the open parking spot for the jeep and we drove into the parking spot. We got out and drank pop and ate sand whiches because we had an hour or so before the concert started. After 3 minutes, or maybe 4 minutes, we bought our tickets and found a spot to sit on the hill. Once we sat down, time stopped I waited and waited until I thought about 5 minutes had passed. I was expecting buddy to walk on stage any second, but HE never did. After what seemed 6 minutes, I bumped my dad with my elbow and asked ‚Äúhow long has it been since we sat down?‚Äù ‚Äúabout five minutes.‚Äù HE replied. HE must be lying to me, I thought so I tried again. ‚Äúhow long?‚Äù ‚Äúsix now.‚Äù It wouldn‚Äôt have been surprising if I died, right there. I tried to fall asleep to pass the time, but there was just too much noise. Minute after minute rolled by and someone stepped on stage. ‚ÄúThe performance will start in 7 minutes.‚Äù HE announced. It was heartbreaking. The wait was only half over. Finally after 7 minutes of dying and waiting, HE walked on stage. It was the best sight in the world. It was worth the long, long wait and I enjoyed it even more. We packed out for the rest of the night, and I knew the drive back would be filled with happy memories of the amazing performance.
1434	19415	7	3	A time when I am patient is at gymnastics. There are multiple ways you have to be patient at gymnastics. Your mind, and body have to be patient, and sometimes you have to be patient with the coach. Your mind has to be patient when you wish you could do things, but you really can't yet. Your body has to be patient when it feels like you're ready to do a skill, but your mind is telling you to stop and be patient, allowing you to focus on the proper technique. You have to be patient with the coaches because they are always helping you improve. So sometimes you have to wait a few minutes until they can finally help you spot your skill. Patience is a very important life skill that everybody needs to have, and gymnastics really allows me to put this skill into practice.
1435	19416	7	3	When I was at Universal Studios, waiting in the long lines for the rides, I was patient. It took a while, but I never got mad or impatient. My dad and I were in line for this dragon rollercoaster; we were so close to being next when it started raining and lightning. A lot of people left, so we ended up being at the front of the line. We waited for another hour or two, but it never stopped. We had completely forgotten about my mom and brothers, so we left to find them. I was patient the whole time. We then got in line for one of the new rides they just got, and since it was new, the line was incredibly long. We waited quite a while. We eventually got on the ride, and we realized the wait was worth it, so we went again, proving that sometimes patience truly pays off with a great experience.
1436	19417	7	3	"When I was @NUM1 years old, I went to my first doctor's appointment it was extremely nerve-wracking. I sat in a chair next to my mom, shaking, wondering, non-stop for @NUM2 minutes. I was running around, and when I finally sat down I said, ""I'M NOT FEELING WELL!! ARE WE NEXT? IS IT MY TURN YET?!"" I couldn't be patient anymore. So I walked out the door when the nurse called, ""You're next."" And I was like, ""Well that wasn't long, only about @NUM3 minutes and a second,"" I SAID, ""but it's only @NUM4 o'clock, and we got here at @TIME1."" MY MOM SAID, ""See, that wasn't long,"" my mom said. Next time when I go to the doctor, I will be extra patient; the experience taught me that waiting isn't always as bad as it seems."
1437	19419	7	3	"Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant; a patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. I’m writing about a time when my friend @PERSON1 was patient. “@CAPS1,” @PERSON1 said to @ORGANIZATION1 as he was leaving to spend his whole @DATE1 in the upper pininusula of @ORGANIZATION1, and @PERSON1 were dating since the beginning of the year. She was sad @CAPS2 weeks had passed and @CAPS4 was the beginning of a new school year. She had been patient all @DATE1 @CAPS3 to see him again. Finally, the first day of school came, she skipped up to him, and he @CAPS3 called away. A couple of confused weeks later, she said to him, are you jumping me or ??? He thought about @CAPS4 for a long time. She had been patient waiting for an answer @CAPS4 never came. Finally, she decided to jump him but she never did. So @CAPS5, Gabby, and me did. @CAPS4 far her on the outside she was mad but on the inside, she was probably screaming; today she has ""moved"" on and now is dating a boy named @PERSON2. This illustrates @PERSON1's patience in a difficult situation, showcasing her ability to endure uncertainty and emotional turmoil without outward complaint, demonstrating a commendable level of restraint."
1438	19420	7	3	There was a day when I was super sluggish. I did everything slow; I got ready for school slow; I walked slow; I talked slow. My mom was very patient with me; all she did was encourage me to move faster. She tried to motivate me and help me get ready for school; she brought me my breakfast and put all my books into my backpack. I thanked her at the end of the day for being so patient with me. That was the day someone was patient with me.
1439	19421	7	3	"To @CAPS4 being patient means to not whine if you ordered something and its taking long to come to you. Thatís what kids do. I have been patient many times in my life but just one poped into my mind when I thought of patience. One @TIME1 I woke up at @TIME1 to go take pictures for our passports. @CAPS7 thought @CAPS8 wasnít going to be bush over there. Boys were @CAPS7 wrong. @CAPS7 started to get dressed up. By the time @CAPS7 were done the clock hit @NUM1. @CAPS7 got into the car and @CAPS7 were on our way. @CAPS4 and my little brother cranked up the music and started singing, I @CAPS1 YOUR @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. My parents got soo annoyed and made us stop singing by turning off the music. ""Mom that our favorite song."" @CAPS5 our @CAPS6.PS. Said ìyou have reached your destination. Finally, @CAPS8 was getting a little spiffed up back here.î @CAPS7 got into the waiting room, @CAPS5 @CAPS7 all almost faint because of how much people there was. ìlets just calm down I mean how long will @CAPS8 take for a sudden a deep voice in my head said, ì @NUM2 hours laterî. My brother decided to make a bet with @CAPS4. ì@CAPS8 you donít crack @CAPS5 its are turn to take the pictures I will do anything for you whenever you want for a week. You have yourself a deal.î @CAPS8 took a while for another @NUM3 hours to pass and I was about to scream. I was then falling deeper and a sleep @CAPS5, the @PERSON1 family your next.î The man had a long white beard and glasses. @CAPS7 finally went in and got over with @CAPS8. ì@CAPS10, I win @CAPS11! I won the bet, with a big smile on my face @CAPS12 you have to do anything I wantî. I was so happy that I started doing my victory dance, while the man with the glasses and beard stared at @CAPS4 like I was a maniac. @CAPS7 took our picture and @CAPS7 were off. Patient means to wait and wait without whining. Everyone has to be patient in there life just like @CAPS4, and this experience taught me that even in frustrating situations, patience can lead to a rewarding outcome."
1440	19422	7	3	Over the August 12th my dad, my brother and I went to CEDAR point. It was really hot but we didnít care we really wanted to ride the millennium force. We found the ride but we first looked at the line it was huge. It snaked almost around the whole ride twice, so we got to the end of the line and sat in the blazing hot sun for a half an hour till we found our cover selves under a tent they put up so it was some what cool in line. So we waited a longer and longer till my brother started to flip out yelling and screaming at the top of his lungs, ìI canít wait here any longerî AND took off he went under the ropes and ran off. My dad told me to wait in line as he sprinted after him. So I waited an hour when finnaly, it was time for me to get on the ride but my dad and my brother were not here so l decided to wait in the line going to the front of the ride. When l got on they still werenít there, well the ride took off and they werenít the best ride ever with me. The experience was definitely bittersweet without them there to share it.
1441	19423	7	3	My dad is in the @ORGANIZATION1. He goes away for long periods of time. The only time he comes to visit us is in @DATE1, near my birthday. But one year my dad wasn't able to come home when he was supposed to. He sent us a letter saying that they were keeping all the troopers for an extra six months. I felt depressed for the longest time. But then I thought about it. Even if it was delayed, he was still coming back hopefully. So I decided to be patient rather than disappointed. Our family sent him care packages over. Eventually he did come back. That was a hard time, but with patience I got through it.
1442	19424	7	3	When it comes to patience you have to be relax. You have to be with your patience when you go to the doctor. When you are at the doctor you will still be done being patience. When you get home you will be patience for someone. So remember make sure you patience at everything. This helps maintain a calm demeanor and understanding in various situations, proving patience to be a valuable virtue.
1443	19425	7	3	I wanted to write about a time when I was patient. One time, we went to Disneyland. My family and I couldn’t wait to go on the Matterhorn. But the line was humongous. I was the only one who got to go on the Matterhorn because I stayed in line. My family kept going on different rides like the Space Mountain ride and the Pirates of the Caribbean or even the Haunted Mansion. While I stood in line at the Matterhorn, I thought about the Ferris wheel and the fun house. Later that very same day, I got to go to the store in Disneyland and waited in the humongous line at the cash register; by the time I had gotten up to the cash register, my family was getting massages. I was patient at Disneyland.
1444	19427	7	3	RREEE! The bus stopped. We were finally here! It took lots of my patience to stay quiet and not scream to the world. I had to be patient through the entire trip, so I had to learn a lot. On @DATE1, I was with a bunch of other fellow fifth graders. We were all divided into groups and unpacked and ready to go for our three day stay at @ORGANIZATION1. I was so excited my friends told me to calm down and be patient. I felt a little embarrased @CAPS4 I didnít care. I finally snapped to it and kept my cool. In @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 I was stuck ahead how to make my ??? of @ORGANIZATION1 & friend in my group named @PERSON1 told me some ideas, @CAPS4 I wanted to have her @CAPS4 ??? @CAPS4 I stayed collected and listened to her ideas and I have to say, they werenít bad. I thought about ??? of the ??? and used it in my pamting. ??? now weíre at the nearly @NUM1 feet high ??? ladder I already took my ??? going up and zipping down the awesome get scary @CAPS3. I was now helping keep people up the ladder. I was patient @CAPS4 man, they took forever! I was about to scream at this one dude, @CAPS4 I said to myself ìbe patient.î @CAPS4 this on kid named @CAPS5, sometimes he just sat right on one of the big planks of word. I asked why he was doing that and I thought their response was hilarious. They said he was trying to be like @CAPS6 and fly to the top. At the end of the three day field trip, my patience grew to the size of a spider monkey, and every time my patience would grow to the size of a drop of water, the spider monkey in my head would be trying to find a way out so they could knock the idiot out. I learned to have patience with someone, even if they were being a idiot and not moving fast enough, I would stay calm and make sure to not let the spider monkey hit somebody where it hurts most, showing me that patience, though tested, can prevail even in the face of extreme annoyance.
1445	19428	7	3	One day I was watching @CAPS1. I was bored; there was nothing good on. So my mom was on the computer. I told her if I can get on; she was like ok. In @NUM1 mins. I waited for her to be done. Ok, now you can go on. Thanks, Mom. You're welcome. I was very patient. That’s the time I was patient to go on the computer, and I was happy I didn't have to wait any longer.
1446	19429	7	3	One time when I was patient was a SUMMER FAMILY TRIP and FRIENDS adventured! We were by the water park most of the TRIP and, it was fun.

I look forward to future amusement park visits, knowing I have the patience to make the most of it.
1447	19430	7	3	One time I had to be patient was on my birthday. One year my grampa and gramhna was late for my birthday. I had to wait a few hours. I sat down intill they got here. When they got here we get to eat cake. After that I open my presents. It took them about @NUM1 hour for them to get here, but it was worth the wait to celebrate with family.
1448	19431	7	3	We're here at Cedar Point. I was so excited I felt like I was going to go psycho; can we go on the dragster first? @CAPS1: why not, it'll be fun when we get in line. It was an estimate of an hour wait. @CAPS2: do you still want to ride the ride? Sure I do, so I knew I would have to be patient before I could ride. While we waited, it was hot, and when @NUM1 went by it felt like an hour! But I knew when it was time, patience would pay off. When @NUM2 minutes passed, the dragster was in sight, and cling cling, we were second in line. Zoom! A car went by, primarily a blue long dragster car stopped, and it had my name all over it. I got in, and it was so patient; it was like @NUM3 minutes before the ride started. @NUM4: @CAPS3. At @NUM5, we went up the hill and it was like a meteorite crashing down into earth. When it was over, my patience paid off, and @CAPS4 always patient because of the Cedar Point dragster. The thrill confirmed that being patient is worth it for such an amazing experience.
1449	19432	7	3	When I was in 3rd grade I went to Luigi's Pizza in Chicago. I ordered with my mom and dad and waited. The waiter said about 20 minutes. Our food didn't come after 20 minutes or 25 or 30 or 35 or even 40 minutes. Our food came after an hour and 10 minutes. All the time I was waiting I was getting more and more hungry. I didn't start complaining or yelling I sat in my seat and waited patiently, showing that even when hungry, I could exercise patience.
1450	19433	7	3	When I hurt my hand on the same day of meaping, I was patient, I was patient. I fell in the hall and I went to the office, I waited patiently for them to call my mom to pick me up. When my mom arrived, she said she was going to take me to the EMERGENCY room. It took a while to find a parking spot when we got there, I was patient even though my hand was hurting. Then we finally found one and then went inside. My mom went to the front desk to tell them I was there. We waited a little while, and then a nurse came out and told us to go in a room to talk; she said I would have to wait for a bed to open up for x-rays. I saw a lady through the window, and I knew it was for me. She opened the doors and asked for ME. She had us follow her to a room where we waited about forty-five minutes for a doctor to come in and take us to the x-ray room. When they finished, we went back to the room and waited a while until the doctor came in and said I didn't break anything. He gave me a brace, and I went home. Through ALL of that, I was patient.

1453	19436	7	3	Patience is useful in certain times like waiting for a blood test or to meet your loved ones again. In other times patience is useless as in the army, any army; you sometimes wait to die by the hand of your enemy. Patience is mostly good because if you rush you might hurt someone, miss something helpful, or just something you enjoy, making it generally a valuable trait to cultivate.
1454	19437	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at Cedar Point Amusement Park and I was waiting to get on the dragster; the line was suppa long. We waited for two hours long and we still was in line being patient. Finally we got up there and they said that the ride will be closed for a while that have to check something and it took them a whole hour for them to fix it. So we went to the other side of the park and we were waiting for the train to come and it came it took the train five minutes and when we got to the other side of the park the ride I wanted to get on which was shoot the rapids the line was really long so we waited and waited and finally it was our turn we got on it was fun then when it was over we got back on the train and went back to the other side. We went back to the dragster then the line was back long and we waited and waited and then it was our turn. That day was the worst day because I had to wait and wait that was my first day that I ever had to hold my patience that long I was about to lose my mind but we had fun. And we are going back this Summer. In the end, though the day was challenging, the fun we ultimately had made the extended patience worthwhile.
1455	19438	7	3	It was a time when my patience was tested when I went to a theme park and we had to wait in line for like two hours. I was bored just standing there, but I really wanted to go on the rides, and that's what waiting in line was for. I was trying to be patient the whole time in line so I could finally get my chance to go on a ride because I hated just standing there; the whole time my feet started to hurt from carrying the heavy bag because I was standing there. I finally got to the front of the line to get my ticket; I was so happy, and that was a time when I was patient.
1456	19439	7	3	A time when I was patient: I'm patient when my family, or friends, or teachers are talking. I don't interapt them while they are talking I wait to make sure they are done talking before I start to talk. Another thing is being polite; I am polite in class an at home I don't talk when it's not my turn. Another thing is I am really nice to people I don't be mean to anyone, I listen to what they got to say. When I'm at school sometimes you got to wait your turn. Like getting a drink, or getting your lunch, or going in a single file line for a firedrill. You can also be nice and patient if someone isn't done you can help them out and that would be really nice and patient. These are the things I do to be patient, and I believe these examples show how patience is an important part of my daily interactions.
1457	19440	7	3	"Hi, I'm @PERSON1 And this is A time of when I was patient. My mom and my step dad were going to take me And my step sister to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. BUT!! There was A twist we couldn't ask ""Are we there yet"". So we had to wait A really long time. But when got there we got there it so worth the wait. It was hard not asking, but the anticipation built as we drove. When we finally arrived, it was definitely worth the wait, making the patience worthwhile."
1458	19441	7	3	"Patience is tough to achieve sometimes. But that doesn't mean you should give up, keep trying and you will succeed; rush through life and become impatient and you used and succed. I will tell you a popular virtue story to explain patience. Every year in the fall a big race takes place. All the animals in the forest come to see it. It is an extraordinary event. It is a tradition that every year, one slow animal and one fast animal compete to see who is this year's champion. At the time the rabbit was the fastest animal around. The rabbit signed up every year and won every time. The tortoise had signed up to compete this year. The rabbit was very confident in himself and was full of pride because the rabbit was fast, slow and the rabbit can't be a champion. ""Runners get ready!"" shouted the announcer. The rabbit and tortoise lined up. ""Ready, Set, Go!!"" The rabbit rushed ahead kicking the air. For the tortoise very slowly waiting behind. Rabbit run like he has never won. He never looked back. He wanted to win. The trophy was rightfully his anyways. Right? I mean, he was the fastest animal. Tortoise continued on his way, slowly but surely making his way to the finish line. ""Hmm, Hmm."" Rabbit stopped and looked around. No one was around. ""What is that noise?"" he asked aloud. ""Hmm"" it came from his stomach he was so caught up in the race he didn't realize how hungry he was. ""Just one little handful of berries."" he decided. He picked a handful, then another and another. Finally he was full and a little bit sleepy. ""I'll just take a little nap after all that tortoise ain't gonna catch up anyways."" He laid down and slept. Little did rabbit know that the whole time he was eating and napping, tortoise was catching up? He saw the rabbit sleeping and decided not to wake him just in case he was sick and he continued to slowly very slowly walk up the hill to the finish line. Rabbit woke to the sound or cheering. He stood up. The tortoise won! He raced to the finish line but was too late, the tortoise had already won. If he had been patient he might have won. The story shows that patience, even when difficult, is essential for achieving goals, as rushing and impatience can lead to failure."
1459	19442	7	3	"In my thirteen years of experience I have rode many roller coasters, and when there is a rollercoaster there is normally a two hour wait. In the summer of 2022 I took my best friend Sarah to ""Six Flags Magic Mountain,"" and we had just gotten in line for a ride called ""The Goliath."" When we got to the entrance the park employee said a forty-five minute wait so we got in line and the ride broke down for over three hours. Finally the ride was up and running but the park employee took another half hour for testing and when that ended the park employee said was a two hour wait in the back. We were at the front so the park employee didn't really affect us. We finally rode that ride and was totally worth the wait. Most of the lines later that day were small but thats still one hour. I just hope next time that ride doesn't break down, because waiting for such a long time can really kill the enjoyment."
1460	19443	7	3	I remember a long time ago when I was patient for a long time. I was patient for about four months. I was waiting to get the video game system @CAPS1. And I was extremely patient for this. So basically what happened was that there was this new, high tech, amazing game system coming out. The @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1. Everyone was eager to get it. Including me. The only problem was that they were all sold out. So for christmas, my dad told me that he would get me one. I was so happy. But we both knew that it would be a long time before he could get one. So I waited, and waited, and waited. Then one night around @TIME1, my dad woke me up. He said that they were selling a lot of @CAPS3. So we got in the car, drove to @PLACE1, and waited in the line for a long time. Finally, it was our turn. We bought the @CAPS1, went home, and set it up. The next day, I finally played my @CAPS1, and that's a story about a time I have been patient. It really taught me the value of waiting for something you really want.
1461	19444	7	3	My mom went to the doctors a couple weeks ago before school. We went there at like 8 and didnít leave till 12. So me and my little sister played a game to entertain ourselfs. So we watched tv, played on our ipods, and we told stories we were so bored. So once all that got boring we just had to sit and wait and sit and wait it felt like school but I just thought about how much longer it was going to be before we left so like hours and hours and hours until the doctor got up and called the next patient at our seats. But turns out it was someone else. Longer than me and my sister fell asleep. Then all of a sudden I feel someone shaking me and saying ìlexi tayler ìmy mom called over and over until we woke up so then now we are ready to leave and go to the mall. So we went and spent the rest of that amazing day at the mall. And the was my story about the time that I was patient sitting in a doctor's office waiting.

Each morning she would eagerly tear off a link, watching the chain shrink. She ripped off links representing weeks, then months and even a year. Before she knew it, the day had finally arrived. Although she was disappointed about the next @DATE1, she was determined to wait and to prove she was responsible enough to own a puppy.
1463	19446	7	3	"This is a story about a vampire named Vlad who goes to a regular middle school. It was the first day of school and Vlad was waiting in line for his schedule and later combination. And this line was really long. Vlad was late on his first day and he had to get in the way back of the line. The person in front of him kept complaining and Vlad was getting irritated. ""This will take forever!"" complained the person in front. ""Hey, shut up,man. I dont like this any more than you do but do you see me complaining?"" exclaimed Vlad. Everyone in the gymnasium stopped talking and looked in his direction. This was not a good sign. Vlad stopped talking and just waited in line . After 20 long minutes of listening to music at his ipod, he was 2 people away from the front of the line. Then something bad happened. ""Hey this isn’t my schedule!"" said a blonde girl. The person who was giving out the schedules had to call everyone back up to see who had her schedule. So 10 more minutes passed until he finally got his schedule. If Vlad hadn’t patience,he wouldn’t have standed the 30 minutes in line! Good thing he brought his ipod! Vlad's patience really saved him from making a scene on the first day."
1464	19447	7	3	A time I was patient was waiting 8 to 9 whole months for my baby brother, Alex who is 10 now. It felt like 2,000 years! It was so long I couldn’t wait but I had to use patience to wait. He was due on July 15, but instead he was out on July 1. When I came to the hospital. Finally at 5 am on July 1 my brother Alex was finally born after 9 long months. That was a time I used patience.
1465	19448	7	3	I remember when me, my brother, my dad and my mom were at Cedar Point. I wanted to go on so many rides but they all had big lines. So we waited for the Raptor, that took one hour just to get on the ride, but when we got on it felt like it was even longer then the wait in line, it felt like two hours because of how intense it was. We walked and saw the Millennium Force; it had a huge drop on it, so we waited in line. It was much longer than the Raptor; it was like three hours. But when we got to the top of the stairs, we were so hyped. It was so much fun because we waited so long, and my brother stopped complaining because he was so into me. The ride was fun, but when we were done, we had to leave, which was like Mom. We only waited on the rides, but it was fun and memorable. That was a time when I was patient.
1466	19449	7	3	My friend and others showed loyalty in a play called @CAPS1 childrenís @CAPS2 plays. They come once every year. Everyone gets ready, learns their parts and we put on a show in a week. We showed loyalty by believing in each other. When you are on a stage in front of people you have to support each other. When someone forgot to enter on time, you would help them out by reminding them the next time. When someone forgot their line, you would help them out by saying it for them. We showed each other loyalty throughout @NUM1 days of rehearsals and performances. The play turns out great each and every year from supporting each other, proving that teamwork and loyalty are essential for a successful production.
1467	19450	7	3	I was patient when I was at the campus clinic a week ago when I broke my finger.
1468	19451	7	3	I am not a very patient person. However, there was a time in my life where I was extremely patient. I was in @NUM1th grade and was doing a thing called tutoring Mrs. Bowos' @NUM2nd grade class. We would go down there weekly. As you probably know, @NUM2nd graders are not very good readers, but there was one girl who was not good at all. She needed extra help from everybody, and @PERSON1 would send me down in the hallway to help the girl read. She struggled a lot and never wanted to read; she would shut the book as though it was on fire. But I was patient, and every time she stopped reading, I would make her keep going. Every time she put it on the floor, I would pick it up. Eventually, the girl saw that it didn’t accomplish anything to avoid this, so she just read. Now I had to be patient with how slow she was reading. If she didn’t know a word, I would help her sound it out. The girl kept getting better and better at reading until she didn’t need me anymore. But I was proud of myself for being patient for once. It showed me that I could be patient when I needed to be, and it made a difference in someone's life.
1469	19454	7	3	My own way about patient is that when somebody is doing something, you have to wait until they are done. And if you rush them, they probably will make a mistake or do something wrong. Being patient is a very important thing in many situations, from learning a new skill to dealing with daily challenges. Being patient is also a very respectful thing to another person because you are not being rude, but instead acknowledging their process and giving them the space they need. Ultimately, showing patience fosters better outcomes and relationships.
1470	19455	7	3	There are many times I was patient, but this one was not too long ago. In fact, it was yesterday when I was taking the MEAP test. I just sat there finished, rereading passages and doodling in the margins. It was absolutely boring and lame, and each of those seconds felt like hours. It was terrible, but I didn’t complain; I just sat there and did nothing. And that was probably the worst, feeling the urge to talk but knowing I couldn't. In the end, maintaining that silence and stillness truly tested my patience.
1471	19456	7	3	The time I was impatient was when I was in school. I was in math and I was wanting to get sent so I could go to my friends at @ORGANIZATION1. So I was waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting. @CAPS1 the clock was not turning, so I started doing my class work and @CAPS2 the @ORGANIZATION2 rang. I was @CAPS3 again. @CAPS1 there is one @CAPS5 @CAPS1 it was not a @CAPS7 @CAPS8 since we had the map, so it was only a @CAPS9 @CAPS10 in all classes, so we only @CAPS11 @NUM1 minutes left till the time moms out so I @CAPS12 some wanted and @NUM2 minutes past and then me and my friend. That's good @NUM2 minutes to so @NUM4 minutes @NUM5 minutes @NUM6 @NUM7 @NUM8 @NUM9 @NUM10 @NUM11 @NUM12 @NUM12 left now @NUM1 seconds rings then goes the @ORGANIZATION2 and that's what @CAPS13 when I was impatient; it was a long wait, but eventually the bell rang, and the school day ended, allowing me to finally meet up with my friends.
1472	19457	7	3	Someone was in line for hot and ready pizza since they are supposed to be hot and ready. A lot of people were in line, and everybody was screaming and getting angry because they thought the pizza was supposed to be hot and ready. Everybody was throwing tantrums. The kids were sitting quietly at the little benches they have and watching them doing tantrums. The people that work in the store were trying their best because there were a lot of people, and everybody was leaving. Nobody showed any patience; they just cared about the pizza. The little kids that were hungry were showing more patience than the angry adults. They were all whining, and everybody said they didn't want to hear it, so they had to shut up. After he was there patiently waiting in line with his mouth shut, he didn't bother to speak. Eventually, everybody went back to normal, and everybody had smiles on their faces, even the little kids. Everybody got their pizza really fast. The lesson is clear: always be patient, and things will eventually work out.
1473	19458	7	3	I asked my mom can I have something to eat. She didn't say anything so I wait, wait, then wait, wait, and wait, and then I went upstairs and I waited too. I was hungry, then I was being patient that whole time. I usually get the food, used to it, I do. Another time, thanksgiving, I was patient they were cooking the food and they didn't cook the food yet so we waited until the food was ready, our stomachs were growling for food, so I waited. A man of patience, I waited until the food was ready. In the end, patience paid off, and we got to enjoy the meal.
1474	19459	7	3	Patience is a quality that some people have and some people don’t. It shows your character to people if you’re patient or not. It can be hard at times, but we all get through it. For example, when I was at a restaurant that took forever to get our food to us, I had to be patient. I was sitting at the table after we ordered, and I got really bored so, I decided to color with crayons I got. After I was finished with that I decided that I needed to find something else to do while I was waiting. My mom was talking, so I chose to listen and then add to the conversation. I talked for a long time. Then our bread came, warm and crusty. So, I ate that for a while and then got bored again. The waiter came and told us our food would be out soon. So, I continued to talk, and then went to the bathroom to wash my hands. When I came back our food was there! So I sat down and enjoyed the delicious meal of spaghetti. When I was patient I got a good reward out of it. Good things always come to people that are patient. If you’re not a patient person then you can always try to become one. It’s not very hard just keep yourself occupied! When you practice patience, you'll find waiting becomes much easier and the reward at the end is often worth the wait.
1475	19460	7	3	A time when I used patient was when I finished my book. We have these things called teacher talks where you tell the teacher about your book that you finished. I finished @NUM1 books called “The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.” I finished the last two books. I wrote my name on the board for teacher talk. The teacher kept picking other people. I had to wait until I got called. Every day I would go to @NUM2 and @NUM3 hour hoping I would be called, but every day it wouldn’t happen. I finished another book, so I wrote my name again, but I still didn’t get called. I put @PERSON1 @NUM4, which means I finished @NUM5 books. Eventually, @DATE1 my name got called. I walked to the teacher with all @NUM5 books. I got to tell her about my books, and I was very happy I got my name called, showing how my patience paid off in the end.
1476	19462	7	3	I was patient at the dentist office. When I went to the dentist office, I was getting my brackets put on. When I was sitting there they told me they had to get my brackets and wire. While they were getting the brackets and wire I got to pick out colors. I waited about 10 mins. Without complaining. Next, they started putting the brackets on with the glue. When they put one bracket on I felt so weird and it tasted like heated metal, “Ew!” I said. After they had put on the brackets and then they put the colors on. My mouth hurt like crazy! When it was all over I noticed it had been 2 hours! I was surprised because I didn’t know I sat there for 2 hours, but I was very patient and waited that whole time! That’s the time I was patient at the dentist office. It was a long process, but my patience definitely paid off in the end.
1477	19463	7	3	A time when I was being very patient was when I went to **Cedar Point**. I went to Cedar Point with my **two** aunties and my **two** cousins. It was just the older girls going, because we knew if we took the little people we couldn’t go into the haunted houses, although we went inside one. It was so fun until we got to the lines. They were ridiculously long. I mean it literally took us about an hour and a half to get on the rollercoaster. My cousins and I were talking for a long time. We were in the back of the whole part, called “The dead zone”, it was very terrifying but fun all at the same time. What a weird feeling. We finally got inside of the place and we still had a long way to go, stairs to climb, bars to pass, it was terrible. But did we complain, not me. I was patient unlike my cousins. We finally got to the top floor and can you believe it, we still had to wait. Then my cousins turned on some music to keep us occupied, but not for long. Then we looked over and realized how far up we were, and started to talk about how scary it would be to fall. Then we went on and on talking. But soon after that we had the people say “we’re going to hold off for a minute to check and make sure that the **steel** coaster doesn’t have any mechanical problems.” That’s when my cousins went off. We tried to get her to calm down. So we all just sat down and waited. Finally the line was moving forward once more. Then we reached the top of the rollercoaster **hill**. We finally could see the **steel** coaster, I guess at that point it looked like time flew by, maybe because we were excited. We finally were on the ride, one of the funnest rides in the whole park called “The maurie”. I guess the wait was worth it. The ride went about **30** per hr, it was jerky, there were drops, it was fun. We were a little patient, but did we have enough patience to get back on, I don’t think so. In the end, the experience taught me the value of patience and how it can make even the most frustrating situations worthwhile.
1478	19464	7	3	One day when I was buying a dirt bike helmet online it said three day shipping and to me it wasn’t very long. When the third day came and I was waiting on my porch for my helmet to come, my mom broke the news to me that my helmet got stuck in Memphis and it wouldn’t be here until next week. After she told me I figured that I'd just have to be patient, as for the next week I just went to work with my dad. After my week was up, and I was sitting on my porch waiting and I almost fell asleep when a FedEx truck came and gave me my brand new helmet. I was finally able to start riding with proper safety gear.
1479	19465	7	3	One time my friend was waiting for me. I stayed in there a whole hour taking my time. He waited though he didn't have to. I got out of the bathroom, I said thanks, and he said anytime. I was surprised at his patience.
1480	19466	7	3	When it was Christmas and I could not wait for Christmas so I open my gifts. My mom and dad give my sister and my second sister and me us money so we can go buy thing that we like. My dad mom and dad and my mom and my mom dad and mom give us money, like my mom and dad dose, and I rember I buy a cute comfortable boots and I could wait to open the boots on Christmas and I was jumping up and down and asking can we open one gife it is Christmas and my mom and dad said no and I got mad. So the next day I wake up on Christmas and it was above 10 in the moning and I look in the living room and no one was up so I have to wait until when my patent wake up and I could wait and the time takes forever and that was a tim that I could not wait, making the anticipation almost unbearable.
1481	19467	7	3	I think that patience is about waiting instead of rushing things. If you are patient, things will actually come faster than you think; for example, if you want something and you have to wait in line, instead of running off and finding something else, just wait. It will always help. Be patient with whatever you're doing; just be patient, even if it's waiting after school to be picked up. If you're waiting for a sale at a store to come, have patience and wait, because it might keep you out of trouble, like overspending impulsively. Be patient with whatever you're doing, even if you are waiting for a turn; just wait, it is not a big deal. Stop rushing things; just be very patient, and you will find things often work out for the best when you don't try to force them.
1482	19468	7	3	"""Ski trip @CAPS1 on @CAPS2, where are you,"" @PERSON1 said in a frustrated undertone. @CAPS2 was suppose to go @CAPS1 over to his house .@PERSON1 had just gotten a new trampoline and they were planning on bouncing all day after school .@PERSON1 was starting to get worried but he waited .Finally his mom came and told him that @CAPS2 wasn't coming. That's when the phone rang .@PERSON1 answered it and heard @CAPS2 on the end. ""Help @CAPS5, @PERSON1,"" @CAPS2 croaked. He didn't sound well. ""@CAPS2,"" @PERSON1 shouted into the phone, ""@CAPS2, @CAPS2 where are you."" ""I'm at my house, get over here."" @PERSON1's mom pulled up at @CAPS2's house and let him out. @PERSON1 didn't care about manners at this point, so he opened the door and marched to @CAPS2's room. @CAPS2 was laying in bed looking up the ceiling with his face looking very swollen. He turned to look at @PERSON1, held his gaze, then looked back at ceiling. @CAPS2 wasn't at school that day either. He went skiing up at his family cottage. ""I wasn't patient when I was in the air. I got crushed and none of it would have happened if I had waited,"" he explained, revealing the cause of his injuries and absence."
1483	19469	7	3	One time I was impatient was at my dad's house. Our power had just went out, so we figured we'd wait up to two minutes, just like it always happened. But after a couple of days, we still didn't have power; I was impatient. On day three, we called people and figured out it was a tree ahead of our power lines; they fixed it, and we got our power back, finally resolving the frustrating situation.
1484	19470	7	3	There are two reasons why I think patience is important. The first is because if you are not patient, than you can end up distracting other people around you. For example, if you finished your test early and you kept telling everyone else to hurry up it’s distracting. Now that you’ve interrupted everyone, they have lost their train of thought and now they have to start over. A few weeks ago, my sister and I were out walking my dog and he pulled so hard my little sister fell over and my dog ran away. We had to be patient and wait for him to return. My sister kept wanting to go call my mom to tell her the dog ran away again but I told her it would be rude to call because it would distract her from her work. Another reason why patience is important is because if you are not patient you can get hurt. Let’s say you were going down the stairs and your sibling was in front of you and you needed to get downstairs quickly but they were walking down the stairs very slow, so you pushed them, they could get very hurt. For example, they could fall and break an arm. In conclusion, patience is needed always and cannot be forgotten.
1485	19471	7	3	ì@CAPS1,@CAPS1 ,@CAPS1î the clock was counting down ì@CAPS1,@CAPS1,@CAPS1îso close come on I wisprered as the clock kept going. My heart was beating like a race car engine.

I was happy I run out side to wait for my dad so could have freedom. The anticipation had been building, but now the school day was done, and the prospect of summer fun was finally within reach, bringing a sense of joy and liberation.
1486	19472	7	3	I was patience the whole entire time. I was happy on the outside, but on the inside, I wish I got a better score on the test.
1487	19473	7	3	"As a child my mom always... My be patient well I couldn't. I'm writing this about her. My mom is very nice, cool, wealthy, and most of all patient. As many thing I did as a chid, and still some hour my mom just calm her self down like we didn't even do anything. It's kinda funny how much patient she has. Along time ago, I remember wasting grape pop on her new carpet!! Wow how scared did I get...I think I wet my pants!! Instead of hiding it like any other kid, when she got home I cried to her, ""I wasted pop on your carpet don't get mad!"" She replied in her soothing, mother-loving voice, ""Let me exage to clean it up."" I passed her a dry towel and siled, just remember this time a kid I can't reach the sink's. Without yelling, she walked upstairs and wet the towel her self. I stayed down stairs look at the purple mess I made trying to help my mom,"" just sit down."" she say holding my hand. By this time momma got don with the stain I was fast a sleep on the couch. My mom gave me a kiss on the cheek she doesn't woke up!! The gig was up soon as she picked me up. ""Is that you??"" I said in my morning voice. My mom being patient. ""What's for breakfast??"" in a high piten voice. ""I will get on it"" she said will taking out my breakfast. I love my momo, and her incredible patience has always made me feel safe and loved."
1488	19474	7	3	@CAPS7 year @CAPS4 went to @ORGANIZATION1, it was about two weeks before school started .That day schools by @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 just opened so there was no lines to wait in .@CAPS4 couldn’t or picked a better day .Then @CAPS4 got to the mantice I didn’t want to go on it, but @CAPS5 mom said “@CAPS1 will go wrong, @CAPS2?” I said “@CAPS3 fine I’ll go on to the ride” @CAPS4 are about to take off going up the hill and right when @CAPS4 got to the top the ride stops. I was freaking out at first but then I got over it. So wel have been up there for about @NUM1 min or @NUM2 and @CAPS4 had to be patient. @CAPS5 mom and dad are on the inside of them. @CAPS4 were sitting on bicycle seats @CAPS4 were not comfy. So then another @NUM3 min pasted by and now @CAPS4 have been stuck at the top for @NUM4 mins. @CAPS7 is were @CAPS4 had to be completely quiet and patient. Then the ride started and @CAPS4 got down to the bottom and finished the ride .They gave us a pass for us to cut in line on the @CAPS8 force .That is all they gave us. So @CAPS4 had fun the rest of the day, but that I learned in life you have to have patience! That experience, while initially scary and uncomfortable, ultimately taught me a valuable lesson about remaining calm and composed in unexpected situations.

1490	19476	7	3	The one time I was patient is when my mom took me to go get my birth certificate so I could play football. When we got there the parking lot was full; I mean cars were so close you could hardly get in and out without scratching someone's car. My mom parked across the streets. When we got in there it was at least 60 to 70 people it parked. People were standing so close to each other you would know their body temperature. The bench was full of people and they were parked like sardines. It was hot and smelled like must. We picked a ticket with 32 on it and they were on 11. We waited for two hours. My mum wanted to leave, but I really wanted to play football. When they got to our number I was sleep. While we was in there I lost ten pounds, but at least I got my birth certificate and was able to get on the field that season.
1491	19477	7	3	I’m not a very patient person. I always whine and complain. If patient means you stay somewhere for a whole without complaining, then I guess there are some times when I’ve been patient, but only if there is a friend there to keep me busy. One time, my mom was at the hospital for a long time, about 8 hours. My friend Sarah was there, and we hung out together. It was actually a lot of fun. We ate in the cafeteria place. We stole some milk for no reason, and totally forgot that my mom was there. I didn’t complain once. Then we got yelled at and had to go back to the waiting room, but it still wasn’t too bad. That was one of the few times I’ve been patient, and I don’t know if it counts since I was with somebody, which makes me wonder if my patience is truly my own or just a reflection of the distraction a friend provides.
1492	19478	7	3	ìMine!îI yelled as the ball came over the net right to me. î That was mine!î@CAPS2 said. ìBut I was already there.îI responded. ìYes. But itís mine.î @CAPS13 argued. ìBut I said mine, you moved and let me get it then wimp me. And watch the ball drop. I exclaimed. ìOkay I guess.î@CAPS2 apologized. This was at volleyball tryouts where I had to be patient and work together. ìNext is rotations!î the A team coach demanded. ìNext partner up in groups of three!î@CAPS13 said. My two best friends som and @PERSON1 were already together with this new girl, who was pretty good. ìYou want to be partners with me and make? Katie asked. ìSure, ìI responded. When it was our turn on the court we were going against @CAPS16, @PERSON1 who spiked it at us. Katie missed the ball totally. The new girl, @PERSON1 and @CAPS16 all cheered. ìNice hit! Very nice job ladies!î one of the coaches. It was the end of the second day of tryouts. There was only one more day left. It was hard for me but I managed to keep together and patient. On the day of tryouts we got to know our teams. We all got envelopes and opened them up at the same time. Me, @CAPS16, and @PERSON1 plus some other good girls made the A-team! So thatís a time where I had to be really patient and stay together, but I still came through and succeeded.
1493	19479	7	3	Once upon a time there was a boy name @PERSON1. Hawell he was right and he was at the secretary of state and he wasn't very patient so he walked in and took a number and got his paper from the woman at the front desk to fill out and started filling it out. It was only on @NUM1, she counting slow so he’s getting angry!! And time ticked by and now it’s on 10 and there’s two people in front of him and he had to leave to go get there temporary secretary card, and the person in front of him is up, the lady behind the desk opened up and called @PERSON1, and he greeted her with a smile. She took his picture and he got his license, concluding his visit with a sense of relief.
1494	19480	7	3	I was patient when my dog had to go to the vet; he was really sick because he had heart worms. My mom and I just waited for about two hours. I was not as patient as my mom because I kept asking her what was going on. After the operation was done, we had to wait even longer until we got my dog back, almost three hours. After the vet called us, we went and got my dog, and the doctor said that he had to wait until he could be up and moving. It was finally okay, and we played in the snow all day long, relieved that he was recovering well.
1495	19481	7	3	AHH! Oh hi my name is @CAPS1 Iím going to tell you how I waited @NUM1 @NUM2 @CAPS2 to do something sweet. Ok I heard about this awesome but scary place called the @CAPS3 @CAPS4! Me and a few friends of mine @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 plan to @CAPS7 there in @DATE2. So far me and them have been just doing the ordinary. @CAPS5 up, @CAPS5 in the shower, @CAPS5 dressed, @CAPS7 to school. Today @DATE1, @CAPS8 are going to my parentsí house and @CAPS7 online to see when it opens .@CAPS8 found out in two days the new location will open up. It is near the parlor and down the road of @ORGANIZATION1. So @CAPS8 cheak it out and its nearby so @CAPS8 are so read to be screaming like a baby when it gets its bottle tooken away. Today is the day @CAPS8 are on the road but what @CAPS8 did realize was how many people would be there. When @CAPS8 got there it had at least @NUM3 people waiting! @CAPS8 sat in line and about every @NUM4 minutes the line decreased by @NUM5 people. Then finally about @NUM6 and a half @CAPS2 of waiting @CAPS8 were in the to @NUM7. It was just own luck too, @NUM1 people were not patient enough to wait but @CAPS8 were respectful. Then @PERSON2 had to @CAPS7 use the rest room so @CAPS8, walk across the street so he could @CAPS7 then when @CAPS8 came back @CAPS8 ended up in the top @NUM9!@CAPS8 waited another @NUM10 then @CAPS8 were in! By the time @CAPS8 were done @PERSON2 was crying (he is @NUM11!) @PERSON1 wet his pants ( he is @NUM12!) and @NUM13 and I didnít do anything ,@CAPS8 had one heck of a night but it never would have happened if @CAPS8 were not so patient. All in all, this whole adventure was a testament to the power of patience, ultimately resulting in a memorable, albeit terrifying, experience for everyone involved.
1496	19482	7	3	Patience is an important thing to have. It helps you and others respect yourself. If you are not patient things will only get worse. My cousin is a big @PERSON1 fan. She wanted tickets to his concert, but when they sold out online she didn’t know anywhere else to get them. She saw on the news that they were giving away tickets the morning of the concert. She wanted to be first in line. Well so did everyone else. She got there at @NUM1 am and there were still at least two hundred people in front of her. She had to wait several hours in line until she could see the ticket booth. Finally when she got to the front, she got her tickets. She was patient and did not complain. Later that night she got fifth row seats, close enough to see the sweat on @PERSON1’s face; that shows how being patient can end up in a good result. Maybe if my cousin hadn’t been so patient she would not have gotten the tickets. Patience will get you @NUM2 long way, especially if it trying to gain respect. My cousin has inspired me to be @NUM2 patient person, and maybe I will get concert tickets someday, proving that a little patience can make a big difference.
1497	19484	7	3	When I went to the game with @LOCATION1, @PERSON1, and his mom, and dad. @PERSON1 has downs syndrome. And he likes to watch games. He likes to cheer them on when they're playing. He also likes to give them high fives after they are done playing. I did not laugh at him. I thought was a pretty cool guy. He likes to talk a lot about stuff like sports or cartoons. I didn't make fun of him when he talks. I didn't when he walks and or when he makes noises that are funny. He thinks of everyone as his friend which they are. When he's standing in line he doesn't move very much. He yells when @DATE1 sport has the ball and is heading for a touchdown. When he gets mad when Spire Port don’t have the ball and they score. I told him that we will get it next time. He says yeah I know that. So he likes to go on to the field to watch. But they won’t let on the field yet so I told him to be patience so he will calm down. When the games over his mom takes us to @LOCATION1 house. We sat in the car being loud and talking. But she did not get mad even now we had to set in a hour traffic jam. So after all that what I think patience is.
1498	19485	7	3	Are you patient? Well, I am always patient. I am going to tell you about a time when I was patient at school. One day, I had to register for school, and it was very busy. I had to wait in every line for at least ten to fifteen minutes. When I finally got all my paperwork done, I had to take my ID picture. After I took the pictures, I went to get my ID. All of a sudden, it came out, but my eyes were closed. So, I had to wait in the line again and take more pictures. Then I went to take my other ID. I waited very long, like about twenty minutes. My second ID came out, and it was messed up. The lady told me when I start school, I will get the correct one. That experience, though frustrating, taught me the importance of remaining calm and understanding in the face of unexpected delays and errors, showing how I was patient in my life.
1499	19488	7	3	A time when I patient was during last @DATE1. My friends and I were waiting in line to get an autograph of the detrnit tigers @NUM1 baseman @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was going to be exiting to meet the players, but the line was long and moving slowly. We waited for hours, inching forward little by little. There were many other excited fans, and the anticipation was palpable. Despite the slow pace and growing fatigue, I remained patient. Eventually, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 left. This was a day when I was patient.
1500	19489	7	3	I was patient when I went to the doctors. When I went to the doctors me and my mom waited patiently for a long time. It felt like years, but it was only for @NUM1 hour. Then, when the doctor called us back to the room, we waited for a long period of time, another half-hour we waited. I asked my mom, “Why did it take forever?” My mom said, “Because there are other people before us.” “Oh,” I said, ok then, understanding the reason for the delay.
1501	19490	7	3	One day I was patient at a water park & I was getting on a water slide, but there were like 20 people in front of me. At the same time, if it hot then I don’t know what; the ground is hot if you have no flip flops. But, I really want to get on this water slide no matter what. So I stand there patiently to get on the water slide. Then I said to myself this better be worth it or im going to be furious. But it's okay; I'm gonna be patient about it. I hope I have fun on this ride. With anticipation building, I'm determined to enjoy the slide after this long wait.
1502	19491	7	3	I was patient last year when I was taking the *standardized test* and it was not done. I hate being patient and when I do it is boring. Patients seem like they take forever. And then people just start getting headaches and then you get in trouble by your mom or dad or teachers for talking too much. And that is why I don't like being patient. Being still and quiet is hard, especially when you feel stuck, making the whole experience unpleasant.
1503	19492	7	3	Patience is when you can wait for a long period and not complain. I don’t think I have very much patience. I think patience is like waiting in a line for hours and not caring because you are very patient, but everything takes patience: games, driving, eating, waiting, and even being at school all take a lot of patience. It’s about staying calm even when things are slow or difficult. So, developing patience is important because it helps us manage daily life more smoothly.
1504	19493	7	3	every school year I wait patiently for summer vacation. It felt like a terrifying wait for summer, but it is worth it.
1505	19494	7	3	"Hi, I'm @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I have green eyes, blonde hair, and I have a good personality. Okay, so I am going to tell you about a time when I was focused. Okay so it was @NUM1 last year, year @DATE1 I think. My mom and I had left for a doctor's appointment. So we left around @NUM2 after school started, a little before 9AM. So when we got there I was just waiting for like @NUM3 hours, about two hours, bored out of my mind. I didn't know what to do so I saw the fish @CAPS3, a colorful aquarium. I was watching them for about @NUM4 minutes, maybe ten, doing nothing then finally the woman of the counter desk said, ""@PERSON1"" then I knew it was our turn. So we went in the room and I layed on the bed. I went to sleep on accident, but while I was sleeping they gave me a painful shot, it hurt so bad. Then I woke up, and that was the time I was patient."
1506	19495	7	3	One time when I was patient I got a @ORGANIZATION1 last @CAPS1 I asked for a @ORGANIZATION1 and my @CAPS2 said maybe. So I waited all year I knew I would get one but I kept waiting and you know what I got a blue @ORGANIZATION1 and on top of that @NUM1 new goues with it. But over the time I waited I was going nuts knowing I was gonna get the @ORGANIZATION1. But when I finally got it I was glad I was patient; the wait was well worth it, especially because I really wanted my @ORGANIZATION1.
1507	19496	7	3	"""Mom! Mom! Mom!!"" yelled Lily to her mom while running down the stairs. ""I have to get this cool new book! It looks really really good. Please, please, please! I have to do errands before I go,"" replied Mom. ""If you are patient you can get the book,"" persuades her mom. Lily who wants the book bad replied ok and they went to do errands. First stop they went to the gas station then post office, then to the car wash, then finally to the grocery store. At the grocery store Lily helps her mom shop. All day Lily was patient and didn’t complain once. ""The last item on the list is pasta for dinner,"" said Lily’s mom. ""Shoot I can’t seem to find it."" ""I’ll go find it."" said Lily who was eager to get her book. Lily looks down every aisle until she finally finds the pasta her mom wants. When Lily finally finds her mom she is in the checkout. When the cashier is done ringing all the items, Lily and her mom go to their car and unload. When they get to their house Lily forgot about the book until her mom came over to her and gave it ot her. Lily showered her thank yous and then realized it isn’t hard to be patient."
1508	19497	7	3	I was patient when my mom went to the doctors and she was having a baby, and I had to wait in the waiting room for an hour for her appointment to finish.
1509	19498	7	3	Patience, itís something that my family doesnít have. Here is the story. While am doing the dishes my little brother is crying cause my little sister @PERSON2 hit him. So since @CAPS1 is crying (my little brother), @CAPS3 starts to cry (my little sister). So then my step dad is playing on his iphone. He is going to yell at @CAPS1 pretty soon. And what do you know he does. Okay you think itís going to get better? Nope wrong. I get @CAPS3 to stop crying. But @CAPS1 just wonít so l call @PERSON2 in here and @CAPS1 got to hit her then my step dad starts to go crazy cause he is still crying now @PERSON2 is being a brat stomping of the stairs. When will everyone get calm down? Now just as l am about to go crazy @PERSON1 (my older brother) comes in and takes @CAPS1 downstairs to calm him down. Thank @CAPS7, for @ORGANIZATION1. Then I calm @CAPS3 back down. What a day well l guess my family does have patience well not my step dad.
1510	19499	7	3	"We all have our times when we are very patient, and the times when we lose all patience we have. Well, yesterday, I was very patient. My sister, @PERSON2, throws tons of fits and she is very bratty. I don’t know what it is that ticks her off so much. She gets very mean and violent. Here’s the story. We were walking home yesterday. Everything was going fine. When we got home mom told us we had to clean. Well our room was clean, and I wouldn’t let @PERSON2 go up to clean it. She screamed at the top of her lungs and cried. @MONTH1, I remind you, she’s ten. She stormed up the stairs and she was on the phone with her ""friend"" @PERSON1. I told her to hang up because we had to clean. Yet again she screamed. So our sister, @ORGANIZATION1, got annoyed and said to knock it off, hang up the phone, and clean. Then @PERSON2 made us listen to @PERSON1’s text messages. I’ll admit @PERSON1 wasn’t being very nice. So we told @PERSON2 to not answer the phone. We weren’t yelling, we were being very calm and patient. She was still screaming so we just left her alone to scream. Then, our mom came home. @PERSON3 and I told our mom what had happened. Then our mom told @PERSON2 she is grounded, no longer allowed to talk, text, or even talk to @PERSON1 at school. My mom also thanked @PERSON3 and I for being so patient. So that is my story about how I was patient. I’m not the most patient person, but I have my times, and so should everyone else. Life is so much better in the long run if you are patient!"
1511	19500	7	3	A time when my MOM was patient is today, last week, and yesterday. My MOM was so patient today because I was late for school, and it was quite a delay, man, about to torture, but she was stopping, so MOM was patient to wait and not go in front of him or blow the loud, irritating horn at him. The next time my MOM was patient is when I was in a basketball game. My MOM was outside waiting on me, and we went into overtime, so she just waited until I came out of the building. The last time my MOM was patient is when we were in Subway. I ordered a cold cut, and it took about one minute until I got my food. I was so hungry I could not feel my tummy. So, in conclusion, these instances highlight a time when my MOM was patient.
1512	19501	7	3	"As we walked in the smell of mouth wash filled our noses, we walked to the front desk. A short little lady with knotty hair and glasses greeted us. ""Take a seat in our waiting room and your dentist will be with you shortly,"" the lady at the desk said. We walked to the waiting room. My mom and brother sat on the waiting couch, and I sat in the little tan chair in the corner. My brother got some papers and crayons while my mom and I waited. But I was wrong; fifteen minutes went by. My mom and my brother were still doing the same thing, while I was looking around the room, bored out of my mind. I kept asking my mom when the dentist would come, but she just told me to be patient. About twenty minutes later, I was starting to lose it. I could no longer sit still. I did not know how my brother could just sit there and color for twenty minutes. I wanted to ask my mom when the dentist was going to come, but she would just tell me to be patient. I got up and started pacing back and forth. After five minutes of that, my mom told me to sit down and find something to do. But there was nothing, nothing I could possibly do that could entertain me. Finally, when I was about to go crazy, a little lady stood in the doorway. ""Time for your appointment,"" she said. I got up and followed her to a small room, happy that the waiting was over."
1513	19502	7	3	"Being patient is waiting quietly for something to happen. A lot of times, you have to patient for a lot of things, such as long lectures, birthdays, and orchestra concerts. Sometimes, no matter how patient you are, the thing you have been waiting for does not happen, and you'd have to leave without doing what you wanted to do for the whole time (and that has happened many times with me). For long lectures, sometimes you have the urge to leave. You have to be patient and wait for the lecture to end. For birthdays, you really want to eat the cake. But, yes, you do have to wait until your annoying sister finishes blowing out the candles and makes her wish. I am part of the orchestra, and we have a orchestra concert about every two months. The first concert is an open concert, and they are usually in May. Last year it was the spring concert. At the end of the concert, there is a cheese cake sampling station, and cookies, and donuts, and all these good cake. But first, I must suffer through playing through many pieces, watch the beginners play and watching at honid video ??? videotapes my face, waiting for a mistake so any annoying can laugh at it and call me an ""epicfail"". But I still live. Playing the piece isn't so bad, it's just some pieces of paper with notes and watching the beginners might is torture, but at least I don't have to play. Video taping? No pain at all. Who says I'm going to mess up? All I have to do is to sit in the back row, and my mom might not even see me. My sisters might not even care. And then soon comes the cheese cake, at like 9:30 at night. That is the good part, but to get to the good part, I must be patient. I'm not really looking forward to this year's concert, on May 12th, because on that day I have a final cross-country meet after school. Where all five middle schools come together for a big district meet at a place called Central Park Middle School. After that meet, my parents have to bring me to that concert at the high school at 7:30 PM. The concert closes down at 11, like always, and I am hoping I'm not going to get any homework. But if I do, I'll just have to be patient. That day is like any old day. Long. I'll have to wait until school ends, the meet ends, and the concert ends to go home, but I can live. All that is on my mind is to live the whole school year, patiently, without messing up or failing badly, and knowing that patience, even when tested, will eventually lead to the cheesecake."
1514	19503	7	3	Even though you may not know patience, there is patience all around us, you may not even know your using the patience like a line for winch or writing for something, but you are. Here is a story about when I used patience. One day, on a hot July day at wider point, we decided that we were going to go to the water park. As soon as we got there we jumped into the first pool. I waited for my dad. After a while of playing we decided to go on one of the water slides. The slide was the water slide at the park. The slide was so big you had to take three flights of staying to get to the slide but after I went down I knew the slide was worth the wait. Thus, patience, even in small doses, can lead to rewarding experiences.
1515	19504	7	3	My story is about a time when I was patient was in (July 14, 2018). I was waiting for ìGRANDPAî to come. I was being patient because we were going to DISNEYLAND. I couldnít wait to go but I remembered to be ìpatientî. The less I thought about it the faster time passed by. Then it came, it was time to head to ìDISNEYLANDî when were in the car on our way there I couldnít wait any longer! More and more roads passed by. We passed city to city; state to state. It was the next day already and I still couldnít wait. During the long ride I fell asleep when I had woke up, we were already there. I had to have patience because riding in a car from CALIFORNIA to DISNEYLAND is a long drive. While being patient I got to see many things and travelled through different states.
1516	19505	7	3	Patience is something is most people donít have. In the story, patience was something that I needed. If I didnít have patience in the story, I donít know what I would do. This is my story. A couple years ago, I was picked up from school. My mom was supposed to take me home, but she wanted to go grocery shopping first. When we were there, she asked if I wanted to come in. thinking about all of the reasons why I donít, of course I said no. I sat in the car when it was at least 90 degrees outside. I was sweating within ten minutes waiting in the vehicle. My mom still wasnít out of the store. There were so many times where I wanted to be angry, but I didnít let myself get this way. I even saw people come in and then come out before my mom got out of the store. It was at least two hours before my mom had finally come out. I wasn't mad at her, I just understood her reasons and apologies why she was late. Most of the time I am not a patient person. Actually, I am never patient for situations like that. I was so glad I was patient for this story; it helped me understand my mom a little better, which made the wait worthwhile.
1517	19506	7	3	Sometimes on days when I have **ZERO** patience at **ALL**, I have to control myself so I donít just go off on someone or totally say something mean to them! Like **YESTERDAY** actually we are going camping up in **NORTHERN MICHIGAN**. We always go for about a one to two hour hike. And when we do we go to lake **SUPERIOR** but just before that to get there we take a ìadventure hike,î so my dad calls it! It takes you through the woods and over or even through the river. But there is two ways you could take; a five minute hike straight to lake **SUPERIOR**, or an hour to two hour hike through the woods and over logs. And on days when I have **ZERO** patience at **ALL**, and just want to get straight to lake **SUPERIOR** we always have to go the long way around! And everybody hates the by the time we get to the lake, because I will just complain and complain some more! **UGH**, sometimes I get annoyed at myself! **BUT** on the way back its more fun after we go swimming in the **REALLY** cold water! **UGH**, my dad says it clears my head! But it really doesnít! And by the time we get back, we are ready to have dinner, but dinner isnít ready yet. **SO** I get to be in a bad moodÖ again! And have to wait some more! It’s a vicious cycle of impatience and outdoor adventures, but somehow we always make it through, even if I complain the whole time.
1518	19507	7	3	Two years ago, my two year old cousin @PERSON1 was adopted from @LOCATION3. My aunt, uncle and cousin had to wait three years before they could even see a picture of her and start doing paperwork. The people at the orphanage were not being very fair to them. They let almost @NUM1 people who had tried to adopt a child a year later after my aunt and uncle tried go first. They had to go all the way to @LOCATION3 from where they lived, which was @LOCATION1, and wait three days until they could just see her. The orphanage made them wait another week to adopt her. Finally, they adopted her and named her @PERSON1. They went through more paper work, said that they would always take care of her, and then went home. After that, @PERSON1 didnít sleep at all the first week or so. Since @LOCATION3 is @NUM2 hours ahead of @LOCATION2, she would sleep during the day and wakeup at night; they eventually taught her to sleep during the night. That girl took a lot of patience but she was finally adopted, showing the happy result of perseverance and love.
1519	19508	7	3	The time I was patient was last [DATE] when we went to Cedar Point. When we went to Cedar Point there was a long line, and when we got to the front of the line, the machine broke. [CAPS] So we had to go to another ride, and I couldn’t wait [CAPS] long because I had to go to the bathroom. [CAPS] I walked out of line and went to the bathroom. When I came back, there were more people in line, [CAPS] but I just waited patiently.
1520	19509	7	3	My dad @PERSON1 is patient everyday. He goes to work and can't wait to come home, but he doesn't go crazy like me cause I wanna leave. No, he does his work and waits till @NUM1 when he can leave and go home. He always patiently waits till @NUM1, doing what's needed until the time comes. My dad always been a patient person and to look up to him because of that patience. It's a quality I admire and strive to emulate.
1521	19510	7	3	I was at the Great Wolf Lodge, and we couldn't go in the water because some kid pooped in the pool. A large section of the pool was brown, and we couldn't go in for three hours, which was very boring. To our surprise, we went outside and discovered there was a pool there the whole time, which we could have been enjoying.
1522	19511	7	3	A time when I was patient, I have been patient plenty of times but one I mostly remember is when I was waiting for a friend to get home from school (I missed school) while waiting I did plenty of things. I played my xbox @NUM1 and I got on the computer. But while on xbox I saw one of my friends come online. He lives in @CAPS1, Missouri @CAPS2. After he got online we played most of day then I got off and watched @CAPS3 because I was bored. Nothing was on so I got on the computer, still bored. So I tried to take a nap, didn't work. After that I tried to play my xbox but after another hour (now around @TIME1) I got bored. I still played for about another half an hour till I just redid my account while listening to music and played some more till he got online, which was a testament to my patience while waiting. We played all day till night.
1523	19512	7	3	"My friend @PERSON1 was patient last week in the lunch line, he waited about @NUM1 minutes. I got to the cafeteria before many of the other students were in line. He was behind the @NUM2 and @NUM3 graders. @PERSON1 was patient by not cutting in front of them and didn't complain. The line was longer because there was a presentation and then it was lunch, the @NUM2 and @NUM3 graders didn't have lunch yet so that was why @PERSON1 had to wait. I thought he did a good @CAPS2 waiting. When many students were filling up the tables I saved @PERSON1 a seat next to me. @PERSON1 finally got his lunch and I saw him go over to the @CAPS1 and milk cooler and grab a orange @CAPS1 carton. I waved to him across the room and he saw me. When he came and sat down next to me I told him he did a good @CAPS2 being patient and waiting to get his lunch. I was almost done with my macaroni and cheese when @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS3 for saving a seat for me."" When we both finished we took care of our trays and walked down the hall to the gym. We were glad we didn't have to be in that loud, crowded cafeteria. In the gym other kids were playing a small basketball game. @PERSON1 grabbed a basketball. I waited until the @NUM2 graders were done, I was patient, the teacher then told the younger students to go back to class, when I got the ball I asked @PERSON1 if he wanted to play around the world. It was one of @PERSON1's and my favorite game we played. It made the whole day better that we could finally play our favorite game after such a long wait at lunch."
1524	19513	7	3	Boom! Boom! I knew my cousins were at the door because they were all heavy handed. So I ran downstairs and opened the door, it was them. Then, we all got into the van you all ready to have some fun my mom all, we replied YES!!! It was so boring in the van but I had to be patient. After, we got to Ohio we stopped and got some food .After 30 mins we got into the van .When we got to Cedar point we were all excited it was going to be a good day I thought but I also knew that it was going to take some time and patience .Next ,when we got into the park we all went straight to the raptor .It was a half an hour ride. This was going to take a lot of patience so we waited and waited when we got on and off we realized it was worth it. Then we got on a lot of rides .but the best one was the disaster .When we got to the van we all said it was fun. Then I realized I was very patient, and it made the day even better.
1525	19514	7	3	One day me and my friend @CAPS1 were going to @CAPS2 to Alabama. It was the most boring thing @CAPS3! Imagine just driving in a car for @NUM1 hours just driving and stopping to use the bathroom. And to make matters worse I had the smallest bladder there which as I can imagine @CAPS4! But we did get to count Waffle Houses because the farther south you go the more people like waffles. I’m not kidding there was at least one Waffle House every few miles. And a kind of bummer was we weren’t just going to Alabama; we were going to the @CAPS5 of Alabama. So when we finally arrived we still had to wait @NUM2 more hours. But when we finally got there, we had a blast! And I have to admit one good thing came from this experience: long car rides don’t bother us anymore.
1526	19515	7	3	I am going to tell you about a time when I was patient. My cousin was at my house and needed help on math homework. Because no one else was home, I had to help him. We sat on the couch and I helped him work through each problem. The reason I had to be patient was because he didn’t know how to do any of it. So I had to sit there and teach him the basic concepts first, and then explain how I got the answer for each individual question. And did I mention that he had three pages to do? It was almost two hours before we were done with it all, going through each problem step by step. And that was a time when I had to be patient, carefully guiding him through the work.
1527	19516	7	3	@CAPS2 father has recently lost his job. It has been hard. It has exactly @NUM1 months since @CAPS2 father has had job. @CAPS2 father has been constantly applying for jobs. But he didn't give up. He kept on trying and trying. Fortunately @CAPS2 father has a job interview in san @CAPS1 Francisco in a couple of weeks he is going. Hopefully he will get the job. Thankfully @CAPS2 father has been very patient. Even though he is being rejected constantly, he still trys very hard to get a job. @CAPS2 father is @CAPS2 I role model because of his amazing level of patientence. Thank god, I have someone to care for me who his as patient as @CAPS2 father. Without the patience of @CAPS2 father @CAPS2 family could not live. Well job or no job I will always love @CAPS2 father. This would be true because of @CAPS2 fathers great level of patience. For that main reason that is why @CAPS2 dad will always be @CAPS2 heroe and number one beloved role model. His unwavering patience makes him an incredible figure in my life, and his presence is truly invaluable, regardless of his employment status.
1528	19517	7	3	"Patience is a very difficult thing for some people. One time I was at a huge party, but none of my friends or cousins were there. I was bored the whole time. I asked my mom if we could go home; she said ""no"". Then I sat down. I waited and waited for a really long time. Then finally we went home. The next day my mom sent me over to my cousins house for a sleepover. This was because I was being patient at the party, even though it was hard. I learned that being patient isn't always a bad thing; you receive good when you are patient. Therefore, practicing patience can ultimately lead to positive outcomes."
1529	19518	7	3	Melay was a little girl, waiting for her parents in the green bush. She didn’t know why she had to. Her parents seemed distressed all the time now. “This must be something I did,” she thought. Her sister was not as patient as she was waiting. She had to be doing something all the time. So when her parents didn’t come and somebody else did she wasn’t happy. Boys came walking along the road they were hiding carrying guns. Melay was thinking, “these are boys waiting along the street. Are they crazy!” Maybe their parents told them to hide this was always for a good reason. She sat quietly thinking about this when she heard a loud crack! “What was that’s” she thought. She looked to where her sister was supposed to be and she wasn’t there. Where was she? Sadly she looked out to where the boy soldiers were standing around laughing. “What were they laughing at?” She looked closer and saw that it was her sister. “No!” she cried out. “Where are my parents, they should be here by now,” she thought. The boy soldiers were walking towards her. Thats when she saw another two married and depleated bodies. She found out that it was her parents. She started running. Running away from tragedy. She made it a mile before she had to hide. She hid in a bush. The boy soldiers were walking around looking for her. Suddenly one cried our, “There she is!” They dragged her out of the bush, and walked for what seemed to be forever. Finally they reached a build. Melay was screaming at herself, “If only I waited. If only I waited. They took her into a room and the boss raped her they quickly shot her to death and dragged her into a dumpster. If only she had waited, she might have survived the ordeal.
1530	19519	7	3	I rember this hot July 12th day I WAS on my way to the dentist/ octhndontist. And I left school bEcAUSE it was the second to last day, And I left school about fourty-five minutes early. My oppointment wAs at two-thirty. So I got to the dentist at two fifteen was About four people there and of me. So I sat down. And two-thirly pAssed, so I went across the street And ordered Starbucks coffee. After I drank the coffee.

She cAme bAck And she told I cAN go right on in. I felt so happy for myself for being so patient, And I got A tooth-break for being patient!
1531	19520	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was when I needed help with my schoolwork. My dad is very smart so whenever I needed help, I usually ask him for help. Well I get out of school at 3:00 PM, my dad gets at 6:00 PM. So, if I wanted his help, I would have to wait but I didn’t understand it. Even with homework that needed help on back in my backpack until my dad got home, I wished I had started with the homework that didn’t need help on. After my homework that which I did all my EASY homework, then it was time to eat, as I ate my dinner. By that time, I was done waiting for my dad to help me, and I was really ready to help me as we ate my dinner. It was hard to wait, but it was worth it to go over my homework with my dad to help me understand it so much more. So, even though it was difficult, waiting for my dad's help ultimately helped me learn better.
1532	19521	7	3	Once there was a lonely puppy. One day he sent a letter to a random address and waited and waited and waited, his tail drooping a little more each day. A few weeks later he got a reply to his letter, it was from another puppy! They soon became best friends, sharing toys and stories through their letters. The puppy learned that patience pays off (usually), especially when hoping for a new friend.
1533	19522	7	3	On August 12th, 2010 my friend JESSICA and I climbed on the bus headed for Six Flags at St. Louis. JESSICA and I were with our church group, and we were together till 1 am. We had been riding all different rides all day and we got in line for the BATMAN. The sign out front said ìwait from this point is 2 hoursî, but we were going to wait it out. I was around 12 then so that would put us on the ride around 9pm. We soon found out that Six Flags also started a Fright Fest at 5 p m and lucky us we were standing right next to a haunted house. Around 7 pm all of us were pretty bored so we played different hand games like slide and lemonade. About every five minutes we would hear loud obnoxious screams, and we always heard mouths running like they were in a race. Then at about 9 pm we got on the ride, and we all loved it. When we got off someone said ìLet's go on the Screamin' Eagleî all the adults loved the idea. As we walked over I could smell sweet treats and taste a elephant ear on my tongue. Little did we know that we would have to walk through Carnevil. Carnevil well it was filled with evil clowns and other spooky creatures. It was not a good idea given the fact that half of us were afraid of clowns. When we got to the American Thunder there was a giant line, but it was only going to take fourty-five minutes. The ride was over and boy did my head hurt from hitting my head on my head rest so many times. On the way to the exit we saw a ton more of spooky directions. We found out later that we had waited in line for five hours. We finally got on the bus and headed home. That day l learned that I have a lot more patience than I thought I did.
1534	19523	7	3	A time when I was patient was when we were leaving on vacation. It seemed like I had been waiting forever to go to Disney World, really it had only been about a month. I was so excited, but I had to be really patient. Sometimes its hard for me to be patient because I like things to be done right away, so waiting a month to go to Disney World was very hard for me. The night before we left was probably the hardest. I was so excited I couldn’t sleep at all. The day we left I was so excited and I was running all around the house yelling. Finally we loaded up the car and left for Disney World. We drove our car there so it took almost two days. But it was worth it, Disney World was really fun and pretty. We also went to Epcot and had an awesome time. I had to be patient at Epcot since there were long lines for the rides, so we had to wait a while. I had a really fun time in Disney World! It was a challenge to wait, but the vacation made it all worthwhile.
1535	19524	7	3	Everybody uses patience sometimes in their life. I have to use it everyday. I need it for basketball. There could be a lot of different reasons that some one would need to be patient. Well, I have 3 in particular. My first one is when people donít pay attention. It frusterates me. When the team members goof off, Coach Johnson gets mad. She will either tell us to knock it off or she will make us run a couple laps around the gym. My first reason leads to my second.The second thing that urks me is when people donít pay attention, they get lost and have no club what is going on. There is a lot of people who take a long time to catch on. My second leads to my third.My third is when somebody new joins the team. We just had to new people join the other day and the season is half over. The newest member of the team can not make a shot. She doesnít put all of her effort into it. There is only like 4 out of 10 or 12 people that is actually good.looking over my paper, all of this I have to be patient about. If I wasnít, I would be in trouble and it would mean I would have bad sportsmanship. I deal with it and put up with all of this though. Over the years I learned about patience. I learned how to be patient too. Iím glad I know how to be now or else where would I be? Probably not on any teams or in any clubs, and I'm grateful for the patience I've developed that allows me to be part of these activities.
1536	19525	7	3	I remember a time when I was patient; it was kind of hard to just sit there waiting on the doctor to call my name. But I suffered through it. Instead of me getting mad about how the lady hadn't called my name yet, after waiting like 45 minutes, I just turned my MP3 player on and listened to my music while reading a magazine. Before I knew it, MS. JOHNSON called my name, “NEXT!” Ms. Johnson said with a smile on her face. So I got up and went to the room Ms. Johnson directed me in. When I left the doctors office and I was going home I thought to myself, “maybe being patient isn’t that bad after all!”
1537	19526	7	3	Almost every time you need to be patient when you are at the doctors or in the hospital. What I do to pass time when I’m at the doctors is play I spy. I play it with my mom every time. There is usually a lot of people at the doctors when I go, often making the wait longer. There is magazines but I think they are boring. Therefore I play I spy to stay patient. Otherwise I would be very very bored, and I spy makes the time go by faster and keeps me entertained.
1538	19527	7	3	Last year I had to go to the doctor on my birthday. So after I came home from school I left right back out. When we got there we had to wait in the lobby. There were crying babies everywhere, and I was worried we wouldn't have time for the movies and shopping. There were still too many people in front of me. I started to get mad. Finally, they called my name. I was so happy I didn’t know what to do.
1539	19528	7	3	A time when someone was patient was when a guy named @PERSON2 was driving and a little girl named @PERSON1 was walking on the side walk and it was a red light. She yelled out loud ìgo old manî  The old man went and she followed him to the store and she asked what was that and @PERSON2 said that was nothing .No you tried  to hit me no you were rushing  me so I went. @PERSON1 says to @PERSON2 I was loosing my patience .@PERSON2 tells her well learn how to control them. He then smiled gently, showing understanding and offering a silent reassurance to the young girl.
1540	19529	7	3	"""Mom!"" Jenny whined, her voice escalating into a wail. ""You can’t do this to me. I’m ten!"" ""Jenny, calm down. I know you are ten, and at that, a very responsive ten year old. Honey I have told you before, I can’t leave you at the house all day. Your father and I have work honey!"" ""Mom can’t you just hire a babysitter? What about Susan? She babysitted last year!"" Jenny’s mother sighed. ""I know you liked Susan, but Susan just wasn’t fit to the requirements I was looking for. Besides, you said you wanted to be a babysitter! Why not try and help at the center?"" Jenny used her well practiced glare at her mother that said ""if!"". This conversation had been held two weeks ago in the kitchen of the Fullers. Mary, Jenny’s mother, Mrs. Fuller, was taking her to Maple county’s only day care, Sunshine and Rainbows Daycare. The name made Jenny want to gag. ""Mary remember sweetie, be nice and try to help out a bit. I love you!"" Mary called as she started to pull out of the driveway. Jenny turned to face the small building. The sign above the building stated ""Sunshine and Rainbows Daycare. A friendly and loving environment"" Jenny had that gagging feeling again. Jenny turned back to see if she could spot her mother’s red, battered, Toyota speeding down the poorly paved road. But all she saw was a trail of dust. Great, Jenny thought as she entered through the double doors that had a picture of a big, grinning, clown, ""Jenny, why don’t you play with little Timmy?"" Mrs. Davis said, comforting ""little"" Timmy in her arms, actually, Timmy was seven, which Jenny thought was a big enough age to not cry when someone yells at them when they’ve asked to play ""one"" for the billionth time. ""Jenny we need to talk."" Mrs. Davis the middle aged woman, shunning Timmy to the side, "" honey, you’ve got to understand that kids need patience and love. Heck, I remember you as a kid! Boy were you an attention hog!"" Jenny looked like she regretted yelling. She smiled and went to find Timmy. Maybe he’d still be game for you, and perhaps Jenny could find some way to tolerate her time at Sunshine and Rainbows."
1541	19530	7	3	"It was a July 4th 7:00 AM and I had to go to school but I was acting very patient so my mom would think it was time for me to have my new phone. When I got home I was acting like a pleasent little angel. But she still didn’t say it was the time to get a phone the next 7:00 AM July 6th I acted the same way but better. I still didn’t get it I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs. The next day July 1st I cooked my mom some breakfast and I was satisfied that it was the day to get my phone. Nope she just hugged me and thanked me with a smirk on her face she was waiting for me to burst one shouting, but I knew what she was trying to do so I said your welcome, although I was feeling intense. The next 7:00 AM I was feeling a little better and I was ready to improve how patient I am so I dressed very professional casual and I had made my own breakfast and I was ready to impress I ate, and I had walked to school. My mom was up when I got home and she said “Come on, I have to take you to get something” I smiled so hard that I felt like my mouth was going to fall out I dropped my backpack and we stopped at my friends house and I wondered my ma said “wait here” me still wondering watching her go into the house. She came out and gave me my brown shirt I left at my friends house. I was so eager and now my smile turned into a fake smile. We got home and I ran straight to my room. I was doing my homework. July 8th the last day for the week. I didn’t do anything but mop all day. I was still being patient though. Then July 5th and July 7th I stayed at my friends house. July 4th my mom was up when I got up for school and she said “Here you can have your phone now"" and I hugged her tight and run out the door very eagerly to try it out, finally relieved that my patience had paid off."
1542	19533	7	3	A time when I was patient I was patient on Christmas. I got to open our presents at nine thirty in the morning. I had to wait and wait. So for two hours I watched television. I thought Christmas Eve would be hard but I made it through. That Christmas I thought was the funnest but I lied; I think this year will be. That day I made breakfast in bed. I actually had a lot of fun. I got my mom a couple things of perfume. Of course, she doesn’t use them, I do. I got her some candles. We got my dad a bright orange sweatshirt. We also got him some golf balls.
1543	19534	7	3	One time me and my family were at Six Flags point over the summer. My sister really wanted to go on all of the small kiddie rides with me but I didnít feel like it. I wanted to go on one of the fastest and tallest rides there. The Goliath roller coaster. It looked really cool so my dad and I ran over to the entrance, but when we got their the wait time on the board said one hour and fortyfive minutes. I really wanted to go on this ride but really wasnít worth standing in that line. So when the line started moving and we were half way their the signs said 65 minutes. I told my dad maybe we should do this another day. But my dad said that weíll be trough soon and he told me for just watch the people on it go by and not talk. We moved up only a little and the time was at 50 minutes, so my dad said maybe we should do this another day and then we left the line to find my mom and sister. Ultimately, deciding to forgo the long wait was a wise choice, allowing us to spend more quality time together as a family.
1544	19535	7	3	I was patient once when my dad had said he was going to give me a letter every week because he was too far away for me to visit; he lives all the way in another state. He told me I had to be patient because I’m not really the patient type. I guess being patient is not all that hard. For me to be patient, I have to be doing something, so I get myself to rest by writing stories and drawing, reading, going around my mother's house to help with our animals. And when he finally comes, I didn’t even expect it. Mom said he would arrive next Tuesday, so I had to wait even longer, within—I guess on some level, that was good; to do it well, you just have to have your mind on something other than the thing you have to be patient about.
1545	19536	7	3	I was patient one time, really patient and it kinda went like this. It was CHRISTMAS and my mom and I went shopping for presents. So my mom and I went to the mall and walked into Target, and I already knew what I was going to get my brother, the new game CALL OF DUTY MODERN WARFARE 3, it was perfect. But my mom wouldn’t let me buy it, so I just bought him a Target gift card for $25. I had to hide it for almost a month, but I really wanted to know what my mom got for my brother and I, but she wouldn’t tell me so I had to be patient. And when CHRISTMAS came I was so surprised because my mom bought CALL OF DUTY MODERN WARFARE 3 for me and my brother, which made being patient worthwhile.
1546	19537	7	3	Once my friend @PERSON1 was very patient, he waited @NUM1 months for the xbox @NUM2 game @CAPS1 v.s @CAPS2. He quietly waited day after day for the game. But one day after school it arrived, a joyous moment that finally rewarded his long-held patience.
1547	19538	7	3	The patient player. Once when I was four and my sister was two, I was playing basketball and my sister always wanted what I had and we always fought over something, so my sister came up and grabbed the ball from me and when we were in the middle of fighting my mom told me to just stand and let her have the ball she’ll just walk away. So then I stood there patiently and waited, feeling a little frustrated but trying to follow instructions. My sister ended up getting so bored she just dropped the ball and left, she did exactly as my mom had said, proving her strategy worked. Then when I was playing basketball again a week later, she ran up and took the ball, so I just went inside and played videogames, deciding basketball wasn't worth the trouble this time. In the end, patience, and sometimes avoidance, proved to be effective strategies for dealing with my sister’s ball-grabbing tendencies.
1548	19539	7	3	When I had to go get my check up with my asthma doctor and a familiar way like that, I had been waiting in the waiting room which had tons of stuff to do if the doctor didn’t call your name yet. So I had gotten myself busy with crossword puzzles and looking at the fishes which were awesome cause they had different kinds of fish. And then mostly I had read my book cause I am a reader, at the same time a writer, but mostly I had read my book when the doctor came in finally to call my name, but I was still busy doing activities. Then he had said he was sorry about the wait which took a while, and I just said it had been fine, and he seen all of the stuff I had been doing while I was waiting. And he said I was a very patient, nice girl, and after that I always wanted to be more patient while waiting for others so I can get a good compliment which makes me feel really good with a smile on the face. Ever since I see that exact doctor who I had an appointment with, he always gives me a treat or stickers. But to me it doesn’t matter as long as I am treating other people fairly, usually great. Because people would love to be like you one day for having patience, and it feels good to set a positive example for others.
1549	19540	7	3	When my mom, @PERSON1 and I went to @ORGANIZATION1, it was really fun. I WAS UPSET because I wanted a lot of stuff that my family couldnít afford, my mom was very patient. I guess sheís just naturaly patient. I just donít know how she does it. Anyway, throughout the entire store, itís pretty big. Itís two stories tall! My mom a little angry with me because I kept on getting mad at her. I WAS IRRITATED even though she got really angry with me, she tried to do her best to not show how angry she was in the store BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT ISN'T ACCEPTABLE. by the time we got home I was so tired, I couldíve slept for a whole two to three days! We got everything that we needed that night when we went to @ORGANIZATION1. The next day we had to put up our night stands. I WAS ANNOYED I really wanted my dad to put up our new bunk bed. I WAS ANNOYED my mom said that he might not get to it that day. I was almost literally hourding my dad to put our bed. I WAS EXHAUSTED when the time came, I was fed UP. my mom was mad at me cause I wanted to sleep in my bed that night, illustrating how the exhaustion of the day led to some tension.
1550	19541	7	3	A time when I was patient was when on August 12 we drove to Six Flags. It was a long ride. It was long because he had a navigation that went the long way to Six Flags and to our hotel. I try not to complain and be patient because the ride was a daylong so that means sitting for almost a day! We were lost in Jackson for almost a hour going up and down looking for our cousin that were coming too. I had to search but there was no space to. I wanted to go outside and run, jump but I hade to be patient. It was 6 in the morning and I was tired. We still had to look for our hotel which was taking forever! At the hotel I was unpacking my stuff and notice I was patient for almost a day which I though I would never be able to do in a car. That was the time I was being patient, and it showed me I can handle long journeys with a calm attitude.
1551	19542	7	3	Not long ago I went to the pumpkin patch with my mom, sister, grandma, aunt, uncle my 5 year old niece and baby cousin. When we were done, we went to a restaurant to eat. After 10 minutes of waiting for the waitress, she comes over just to tell us she will be with us “soon”. So we wait for half an hour just to put our drink orders in. When we finally got to order our food it took them an hour to bring it.
1552	19543	7	3	While I was patiently waiting for my little sister to arrive that Father's Day morning in June of 2023, I was so excited. I'm not a very patient person, so when it came to this, it was so hard to sit still. Waiting for my turn to hold her was hard, but when she was in my arms, it was the most amazing feeling in my life. It's always hard having to leave her when she's calling your name; it's like I want to cry. I don't always get to come home to a little girl saying my name, but I love every minute I do, and I cherish those moments. I always patiently wait to see her again, but it is hard if you know what I mean, making the anticipation almost unbearable.
1553	19544	7	3	At the caseworker's office. I had a therapist appointment. At the therapist's office I was waiting in the room for her to come back. Then the caseworker asked me questions and my foster mom questions. Then she left out she went and found the other caseworker and talked to him. Then they came back and said thank you. Here goes the papers you need. The foster mom said ok thank you. Then the caseworker said to me, ìthank you for being patient person1. I appreciate that so much,î ìokay to Iíll see you guys next time ok.î Okay we said ìbye.î The visit concluded with a sense of gratitude and anticipation for the next meeting.
1554	19545	7	3	Patient people are the people that tolerate life. If you’re not patient you won’t get through life well. I learned this when I was little. There was this thing I wanted and my mom was going to drive me, but just before I got out the door, the phone rang. My mom picked up, “Oh hi Susan no not busy she did not! no!” and it went on for so long and every minute I kept getting less and less patient, I finally burst out. “Mom take me now!” She said, “hold on Susan I’m on the phone, I’m not gonna take you now!” and walked away. That’s why being patient is important; it allows us to handle delays and frustrations without losing control, ultimately leading to better outcomes.
1555	19546	7	3	In the @DATE1 time my mom had planned a trip for us to go to @LOCATION1 for two weeks. We were on our way to the airport and there was a lot of traffic trying to work through, but we could not. So my mom started yelling, and I told her just calm down, we will make it. So, finally, we got to the airport and there were a lot of people, so we had to rush; finally, we made it to the airport, and I taught my mom to be patient and you will get where you are going. So, finally, we made it to @LOCATION1, and our vacation could begin.
1556	19547	7	3	"A time I was patient was when I was at a dentist office I had to get six teeth pulled. When we were waiting I kept asking my mom ""when are we going, when are we going?"" When they said my name I walked into the room. I asked if it was going to hurt and they said, ""you won't feel a thing."" The doctor put a tube on my mouth and said, ""close your eyes and breathe."" Without even knowing it, I fell asleep from the gas. I was asleep for two hours, and when I wanted to get out of the chair, they said ""no, no, no,"" so I sat and sat until five minutes later they let me out. I was all loopy and had to be put in a wheelchair. When I got to the front desk they let me take two toys, and my mom gave me a wrestler. When we were about to leave, my mom talked to the doctor, and they took forever. When we got in the car, my mom took the wheelchair back, and we were off. During the ride, my mom told me I couldn't go to school that day because of my teeth. She said not to look in the mirror, but I did, and it was gross. I had to wait three hours for food and drinks, so I was thirsty. When she said I could eat, I was happy. I am still patient because the doctor said that grown-up teeth would come in a few months, but it has been two years and nothing, so I am disappointed, but now I have to be patient and wait for my mom to take me to get braces, which is gonna hurt really bad, requiring even more patience in the future."
1557	19548	7	3	On a fine Tuesday day I was heading toward the DENTIST office. I wasn't pleased. I didn't want the son to get there. But it did. When we got inside, my mom went to the checkin lane I just sat down. When my mom got done she sat right next to me and we waited. And we waited and waited. We waited for about 20 minutes until the DENTIST came and called us in. Right when we get into his office a nurse came in and checked my temperature, heat beat, ex. When she was done and left we waited and waited. We sat there for 15 minutes before the DENTIST came in. when he was done we checked out and left and I don't have to go there again.
1558	19549	7	3	When I was in the @NUM1 grade, I had to put a marble set up, and then I went to put the marble set up and it broke. Then we went to the park, and I had to wait for the swing. After that, we went to the ice making, and I had to wait in a line of people. Then when we got there, we paid them our money, and after that, we went ice skating. And then that was all we did that day, and then we went back to the house to build our marble mine. After that, we went to the house and played outside and inside the house. It was a fun and busy day full of different activities.
1559	19550	7	3	My friend and I were wanting to go on a new ride at Six Flags. The ride was called Shooting the Rapids. It was a water ride we wanted. Over two hours to go on it. It was boring after that we went on the Corkscrew; it was fun.
1560	19553	7	3	One early morning in Boston, Massachusetts for a regional skating competition I completed. I was waiting to hear if I made it to the final part of the event. I had completed in it. It was seven in the morning when we left the rink. We went get a bite to eat and went back to the rink when we were finished. My best friend Sarah also was in the same event I competed in. I knew she would make it to the final, but I didn’t know if I would or not. After a endless wait they were about to call out the people who made it. I kept saying over and over again in my head my number I was given. They called Sarah's number. I was waiting for my number to still be called, but they never called it. I had not made it. I was disappointed, but I couldn’t do anything about it.
1561	19554	7	3	@CAPS1, @CAPS1 is a huge part of life to be patient. While you have problems and obstacles that makes you a good person. To have @CAPS1 it helps to persevere to get the job done that has a long process you might have to wait for an example I have to have @CAPS1 all the time for like football, hockey and all the active things I do you have to have @CAPS1. As you know adults probably have any more @CAPS1 than teenagers like myself, like if I were to sit in my blind with my father all day! Like he does it never does happen. Now when I become more grown up and an adult I‚Äôll hopefully have way more @CAPS1 and be able to sit in the blind all day with my father. I also do have to say I‚Äôm getting better with @CAPS1, because my dad preaches and preaches to me about @CAPS1, @CAPS2 hopefully when I‚Äôm an grown adult I‚Äôll be able to have some good @CAPS1 like my dad. So, patience is important and something I am working on.
1562	19555	7	3	To say really Iím not a very patient person, but once I was, I donít really know how. I was waiting in line to pay for some earphones. I loved those earphones they were blue my favorite color. So I was waiting 5 minutes passed then 10 then I lost track of time but I knew it was a long time. Then the cashiers were having trouble with the registers. So I waited longer and longer until some people were trying to fix it. Then I had to wait even longer. I guess I stayed in that line for more than an hour. I really loved those earphones but as much as I wanted them I just couldnít wait any longer. I ìgave upî and put the earphones aside and left the store. I was really mad that day. Two weeks later we came back luckily the earphones were just where I put them. Yesss!! I was so happy I could finally purchase them, and the checkout process was smooth this time around, proving that sometimes, patience really does pay off in the end.
1563	19556	7	3	One day, my mom was really patient. We were outside just talking to each other. My grandma and grandpa called to see if we wanted to go to their house. Of course my mom said yes. So I went and packed some things to take because they don’t have anything fun. So when we hopped in the car, turned on the radio and everything was fine. It was fine for five minutes until traffic was backed up in my sub. I was fine until I got a text saying my cousins were over there. I was so mad but my mom just kept her eyes on the road. I was keep on screaming and saying mom go faster, but she just ignored me. It was like it went through one ear out the other. Then I got a text saying were gonna be playing football in like 10 min. he asked me when are you gonna be here? I said “I don’t know” of course my brother was already over there because he spent the whole day. It was a bad day. I was still trying to tell mom to hurry up, but didn’t listen. So then I was going to ignore her. That didn’t work because she didn’t talk. So I fell asleep at 2:00. I thought I went for bed forever, but I woke up at 2:05 in the same spot. I was devasted. I yelled out the window and said “why”. Then I went to bed again. When I was sleeping I felt the car go faster. The traffic was all gone, until we turned the corner and got stuck, in traffic again. I asked my mom how much longer she didn't reply. So I screamed it again and she yelled back “here”. I looked out the window and we were here. And I got to play football. Then I heard my mom laughing in the house. I don’t know why she didn’t talk. Maybe she just wanted to see her mom and dad. I never found out, but I'm thankful we made it. That was the time my mom was patient.
1564	19557	7	3	"Awhile back my friends and I made a @CAPS2 game called ""@CAPS1 n go @CAPS2"". I had just taken a great sniping position. I had a great angle in all but one direction. The great thing about this spot was that everyone walked past it to get around in the woods, @CAPS3 usually it didn't require any patience. That's the part I was wrong about. I ended up waiting over twenty minutes until I saw one of the people that were playing. I aim my weapon and fired, @CAPS4 to the rules he was now on my team and under my command. We waited for a while before another player was seen walking close to us. Then my partner got up to fire his weapon at the other player and got shot. He didn't notice me when I crawled away from him, @CAPS3 I was safe. The only problem now was that I needed a new place to @CAPS1 @CAPS6 hide. I found one quick. Again I was waiting for over twenty minutes. Finally I saw another player and got ready to shoot. When I finally got my weapon from the ground the person was gone. This made me pretty made seens how I waited @CAPS3 long and didn't have a single person on my team. I got up and went looking for someone for my team. I was looking my patience and getting frustrated. ""@CAPS7 Is anyone even out here?"" I whispered ""@CAPS8 Gotcha! I got you @CAPS9 covered!"" someone shouted from above. Then @PERSON1 John jumped down from a tree. He told me that the whole time he was watching me. He was waiting for me to get close enough to shoot. This whole time he was waiting with just enough patience to shoot every single person one by one, proving that patience could be the ultimate weapon in ""@CAPS1 n go @CAPS2""."
1565	19558	7	3	One time I was getting a cool @CAPS1 game; it was sooo awsome. And my mom said we will get it on fri. It was @DATE1 and was soo part for her to get of work. And she got home and said we well go on stater day. I was a little mad. Bat how cares. But yea we got the game on the next startday; I couldít believe i was patient. It was a long wait, but getting to finally play made it worth it.
1566	19559	7	3	A patient person in my life is my mom. I say my mom is patient because she always drives me to soccer events, soccer practice, friends' homes, and other places if I need to go there. Also, she spends money on our soccer, our hobbies, and other things we need or sometimes want. She is never impatient and is always kind when we're sad or angry and takes a lot of time to do stuff for us. Also, whenever we're having trouble in school, she helps us study; an example of most of these events would be that she spends @MONEY1 on our sports every year, and that's not including additional things like gear, uniforms, and team stuff. An example of her driving us places is that she dedicates about an hour, even has to, driving me and my brother places like cross country, soccer, and basketball; she also helps us with our homework @CAPS1 because when I needed help with a test, she stayed with me for carefully @NUM1 hours, going over each concept until I understood it. Also, whenever I do bad in school, she just encourages me to do better but still is a little discouraged because she wants me to do good, showing she cares about my success. She also supports me being a vegetarian even though it means making two meals, showing her acceptance and willingness to accommodate my choices. In conclusion, my mom is one of the most patient people I know, and her actions consistently demonstrate her loving and supportive nature.
1567	19561	7	3	A time when someone else I know was patient was when my mom was looking for a job. My mom is very very busy. She was the president of a club named @CAPS1-@CAPS2 for about one or two years. But now that she is not the president anymore, she is less busy but still has an important position that requires a lot of work. But with either position, she wasnít earning only money. So she decided that she would get a job. She started looking for jobs online and in the newspapers and things. She couldnít find a job that was right for her. She never complained about it even though she was having a hard time finding a job. She kept on looking and looking, carefully reviewing each opportunity. She kept looking for about another year until, finally she found a job at @CAPS3.C.C. She now teaches a computer class for collage or older people. Because of her patience, she didn't settle. If she liked, she would have ended up with a job that didnít enjoy, but her patience ensured she found a fulfilling role.
1568	19562	7	3	I hate weddings. I love when people get married, but I hate the ceremonies. They’re so boring. Especially the long weddings that take like two hours of people just standing there or doing nothing. I’m not the most patient person, so that’s probably why I hate long weddings. Now that is one long story about patience. “Do we have to go?” I moaned to my mother. “Sweetie, it’s Sarah’s wedding and it’s important.” “Ugh.” I had to surrender as I put on my new dress and got in the car. The wedding was all the way in Riverside. It usually takes only an hour to get there, but not this time. Our family was about a quarter of the way there when we got into a major traffic jam. “Come on!” my sister yelled. I just kept quiet. Finally, when the traffic jam cleared up, a dramatic event just shot out. The road we had to go down was closed. So much for taking the short way. We had just entered the town next to Riverside when we got a call from my grandma. “Hello?” My mom answered. “Where are you? The ceremony just ended,” “Oh no. That’s bad. We’re in Hilldale, why? Has the reception started yet?” “Not yet, but I’m sure you’ll make it in time to be there,” “Okay. That’s good. Bye.” “Bye.” Miraculously, as if on cue, we reached the reception. I was so happy to be there even if I do hate weddings. “Did you have fun?” My mom asked as we arrived home. “Fun? I asked.” “Actually, I guess I did, even the car ride was kind of fun.” “Really? You tend not to be the patient type.” “I know” I said and I was proud. It seems that even I can learn to tolerate things, and maybe even find the slightest bit of enjoyment, when it matters to the people I care about.
1569	19563	7	3	A few weeks ago, we had a garage sale and a mom to mom sale. I had to be patient because of the customers that were driving by at the garage sale, or at the mom to mom sale when we had to wait for people to come to our table and browse. At the garage sale I even had a lemonade sale to boost our earnings! Out of both sales we made a lot of money but, still we had to take some stuff home and donate it. The sales were fun but, we had to go through it all and, price it carefully. So we just sat there sometimes, but sometimes I was happy because the people had bought the stuff we had, and we had a lot of fun doing a mom to mom sale and a garage sale! I think that we did pretty good! We did sell some stuff, but some of it we still had left to pack up and take home to donate. We had to do a whole lot of work to prepare and clean up, but I liked it a lot! Despite the leftover items, the experience was a positive one overall.
